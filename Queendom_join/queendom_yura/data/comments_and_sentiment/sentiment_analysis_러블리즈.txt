(2) Oh My Girl sings contest negatively from the concept conference in that the concept is the same. I got Benefit and changed the song, but this is my choice. No company opinion. Of
(3) The preparation period is given, but the stage is set up without even analyzing the music. Six Senses is not a sexy concept, but a song that should show intense charisma with a wild, powerful, liberation from society and resistance. But the rubbing hand kiss kiss kiss wink smile /
(4) The original song is very difficult among the girl group songs, and it is known as a legend among the legends, so it is hard to be flat even if you are good at it.

In the comments, there was a schedule that only my girl had a schedule, but not all singers had a schedule. There is a lack of Lovelyz, but I practiced for a day or two because my company gave me an arrangement at that time. My agency didn't work properly either. I was late and the arrangement was not good, and Lovelyz had some unfortunate parts. There is a lack of stages, so of course you can be criticized, but there is no reason to blame your appearance, personality, or previous stages. People who go to every Lovelyz video and mention Ohmy are not polite. I'm talking about attitude, but my girl also says it's burdensome. There will be editing issues. Of course, at the same burden, I think oh my girl and wm did well. The song change was provided by the Queendom side and I just changed it to what I wanted to win in the game, but I am sorry that I didn't come out with the song, but I think it's not enough to be sour as it goes. It was also a question of the Queendom program that we announced on the morning that Lovelyz didn't mean that. If you're a problem with Lovelyz v app, you're not sure. Is it really good to be ridiculed by referring to videos, articles, comments, blogs, even if you don't have any innocence, and to go to the Lovelyz stage video and mention Ohmy?
It wasn't just in response to the stage or criticism, but it was just that Lovelyz responded that way. The critics are not right or mature. There are some places where Lovelyz should be criticized,
Don't justify their wrong and don't rationalize their actions. Oh My Girl and Lovelyz I've been doing well with you for a long time. And it's a chance that Lovelyz was forced to do what he did on the Queen's side, and so on. The opportunity just came and caught the chance, it's not wrong. The better the result, the better.

I didn't do this stage, and I'm not incompetent, but it wasn't arranged by the feeling of Lovelyz but it's far less than the original song.
Oh My Girl-Because I have my own thoughts, I know what kind of stage I need to take advantage of my strengths to get the best stage. So she interprets the songs as she feels and makes a perfect Oh My Girl stage.
The reason why I compare it with Oh My Girl is that the two groups would have similar problems anyway when the two groups swapped each other.
But oh my girl, will this song go like this? How do you feel about that song? I like this song. This is our advantage, so let's take advantage of this. In this way, I tried to make a good stage by adding my own strengths to the strengths of the opposing team's songs. The result was the best stage.
But Lovelyz has a similar concept, which is likely to come in sixth.
It seemed to be absent (the two groups are not a matter of being friendly) and the stage itself had no strategy at all. If Lovelyz had a contest with Oh My Girl, they would have been able to achieve their high scores if they had really interpreted their strengths, charms, and interpretations of the song correctly. I don't know why you think your rank is low when you sing Oh My Girl. Why do you think there's no match in the color of Lovelyz? I know that I wanted to do something different, but I didn't consider my strengths at all and changed my image.
Like I said, I wish I couldn't do the sixth sense. But it wasn't just Sixth Sense, but Beagirl didn't show enough ability to erase it, so it was only comparable to Beagirl.
What was Lovely Six's Sixth Sense?
The original song was really powerful and proud, and if it was sexy, it was also sexy
In the beginning, it was difficult to handle this song with the thin tone and vocals of Yu Ji-ae, elite, and Seo Ji-su. But I didn't arrange for the members.
(It's hard to arrange this song like that in the first place.)
And I can't think of a wink or gesture in the middle that this song is not interpreted at all.
So I just changed the image of the group
The merits of the group, the members' individual vocals, their skills, and the interpretation of the songs were not considered at all.
Those features are compared and mentioned to Oh My Girl who decided to sing each other in the contest.
Since 2011, when it was called the Ullim Girl Group, there was a lot of interest in this group.

Overall comment: Lovelyz is not suitable for power or sexy tone. However, semi-sexy is possible if the atmosphere is mainly tones such as the temperature of LABOUM. And there are a lot of members who have the voice tone of the upper part, so it can be well harmonized. In addition, physical is a play and a play, so if small members want to have a power concept, they should be prepared for the tall immigrant who is ready to go out of the ankle. Looking at the dance line, Nine Muses honestly feels like a baby girl in a fan meeting because it was physical superiority. And the rap part member is Baby Soul, but the main vocals go to the vocal cords, so the bass members Ji-soo Su and Lee Mi-joo have to work hard.
Lovelyz to look at
High soprano
(Aesthetic)
K (the high-pitched stability semi-vocal method, so it's definitely the top but it's a little unpleasant because of the nasal sound)
Yoo Ji-ae (Just a baby's voice. Ventilating voice. It may be licorice to someone, but it may seem like an irritating determinant to someone. .)
Mezzo Soprano
Baby Soul (If you look at the tone, the high-alto in the mid-range is also a scam rap that's good for the bass and treble soon.) It's a bit unfortunate that there aren't many songs in Lovez that are musically matched to Baby Soul.)
Jin (Myeongeun has a stable high pitched sound in the mid range, but the sound is loosely husky in the bass, and the voice tone is unstable due to the vocal cords released from the treble. You'll need to build more stamina and practice more breathing, so the tone will be cooler.)
Lee Mi-ju (I was surprised. Instinctively, the sound is tight. Actually, the voice itself can be heard as a bass sound, but it has a stable and powerful body that has the ability to be used in the mid-to-low range. The visuals are so noticeable that the voices sound normal, and because of the personality, I sometimes get excited and the voices are bouncing.
Mid (high alto)
Yein (Sometimes when I see Yee's voice, I have no feelings, because it comes out of the pitch of the knife, which is exactly the same calculation as Imizu. Strangely, it's just mid-range. The pitch is accurate, the voice is very even, and the slow tone is applied to the song. .)
Bass (alto)
Ryu Soo Jung (Actually, I'm surprised because I'm so good at this. Idol Husky voice friends with a good tone. It's good to listen. As the tone is eaten, the volume tone is bigger and more unique to K Baby Soul.
Bass (Contralto)
Seo Ji-soo (Singing ability objectively compared to other members. I sometimes saw a lower part than Yu Jiae because of the bass too much. It's very heavy and the other members go down to iced tea and badly caramel macchiato, but it's espresso alone, I think it's the dark horse of Lovelyz. I don't like the elements, I want to be more confident, and all Lovelyz fans like Jisoo !. Finally, the mid and high tone using the nasal sound is like a cat and mystery.

1. youthfulness and innocence 2. lyrical emotions
These two things. Surprisingly (somewhat named) groups are not as strong as this group
Not only do these two concepts, but when you try a new concept, I want you to consider whether you want to harmonize with them.
For example, if you go to the sexy concept, you can feel seductive while maintaining a lyrical feeling.
If you want to do a girl crush, you can put your dance brakes in the middle with the concept of a tough cheerleader's daughter.
The first two stages just abandoned those merits,
This stage makes good use of those two things. And the new song moonlight makes a lyrical feeling while trying new things.
I could change those two concepts while applying them, but it was a shame as a fan. I hope you don't tie yourself to the ridicule that you mocked in the last contest, but keep trying to keep your strengths.",0.9382,0.107,0.689,0.204,pos

It's not real. I think ...
There is something that bothers or darkens Lovelyz, and I'll call it a.
-The first time wearing a mask and throws off.
a puts on a mask and teases Lovelyz; To get out of it, Lovelyz throws it off.
-Backdancer's Costume and Lovely's Costume
Back dancers are already enjoying what Free or Lovelys want, so they don't have a red stripe on their clothes. However, Lovelyz hasn't escaped from a yet and has a red stripe around her clothes.
-Even in my lyrics, I can't find me
a keeps Lovelyz trapped; somehow he loses something and moves as a man controls.
-Lyrics baby After you leave maybe fly in the night sky
As Lovelyz said, the body is tied up in a line (can't escape from a), so when he leaves a he finds himself.
-When the moon rises, the dazzling moon rises
Lovelyz knows he can't leave instinctively.
I'm so used to a life, but I want to leave, so I only listen to a when the curtain is up and try to leave when the curtain is closed.In the lyrics of a brilliant moonlit night, I know that a is only active in the dark. Demonstrate a willingness to flee during the day when the moon does not rise.
-I got only me
Lovelyz knows that only he can have himself.
-We're tired in the movie that ended in lyrics
Both a and Lovelyz are exhausted, but a can't let go of lovelys until the end.
-Happy ending that started in the lyrics Now I found me
This part can be interpreted in two ways.
Lovelyz is mistaken for being out of a, suggesting to show himself without being bound by a.
2.If you hear me now, I'm looking for me and I can hear it. Lovelyz is still missing from a, but Lovelyz is planning to get away from a.
-Last mask
This part is also related to the above 1,2. Three interpretations are possible.
1. Awakening from the illusion of being separated, implying that it will never escape from a; moreover, the stage is already darkened, and has already entered the realm of a.
2. Lovelyz will no longer be from a.
We are ready to escape, so if we wait for a to become inactive again, we can completely escape from a, indicating that Lovelyz's length will not flow just as a means.
Lovelyz already plans to get out of a but gets caught by a again, suggesting that he will never get out of a either. Unlike the interpretation of 1

In addition, I hope this Queendom will appeal to the star. As far as I know, Ringing is good at music, but it's more of a mass production style that the company directly manages, not a project type. But look at the overall result. There were some difficulties and bad results, but they expressed the colors of Lovelyz best and finally made the best stage. Especially, the last Moonlight seems to have melted Stahl's totals so far into the song. Ms. Star needs to consider this part carefully even for the youngest group.

6328,"An entire month later, and so many of you continue to mock Lovelyz over something as trivial as a song cover. The performance wasn't great and constructive criticism is a good thing, but how is calling for Lovelyz to disband constructive? How is calling them talentless and ugly constructive? How is saying that they're undeserving of their own song constructive? How is endlessly posting ""Pop~! ❤"" in all of Lovelyz's articles and videos constructive? It's just bullying at this point, and it's gross.
These girls didn't do anything ACTUALLY wrong. They didn't bully or hurt anybody, do drugs, or illegally gamble. Their record has been spotless for 5 years now. A couple of spotty performances on an Mnet reality show doesn't deserve this kind of vitriol. C'mon, you guys!
If anything, Korea should be proud about having a group like Lovelyz. They're talented, kind-hearted, and their music is so, so good. Did you know that their lyrics contain hardly any English words? Because of that, the beauty of the Korean language is displayed wonderfully! Did you know that all of their songs are composed by Korean composers? In a world where so much of K-pop is composed by foreign songwriters, that's awesome! Did you know that Lovelyz is the only girl group to have a song composed by the fantastic Humming Urban Stereo? That's just really cool to me! Did you know that Michael Jackson's producer, Brent Fischer, acknowledged their talents by wanting to work with them? That speaks for itself!

Jisoo really did the best in this concept which surprised me because I’ve always thought Mijoo was too sexy to be in Lovelyz but even Jisoo seemed to be into it and sexier than Mijoo in this perf.

And i want to tell you
Honestly LOVELYZ is one of the best group for dance and sing in 3rd gen.. (especially in this show)
For dance, they are superior tbh  you could see in unit performance even they just send their lead dancer yein, she already slay it..
And for vocals, i think they are the best after mamamoo(maybe)
We know that both of the groups are known for their accapela.. and it depends on your preference who is better.. with me i really love lovelyz tone.. and kei know how to sing(i mean great technique) with jin and babysoul tone too.. n sujeong.. the groups fill with great vocalist.. mijoo and yein too could pass as lead vocal..
Its that people still dont recognize their talent..
And its so frustating! Really. 
But i kniw that one day lovelyz won't be the CAMEO and become the MAIN CHARACTER.. 
Okay thats are my HONEST opinion..
Have a good day guyss..

On another note, I'm glad Woollim let the girls joined the show because I could see how much it's changed them as artists. Yein certainly has improved a ton vocally and Jin is more expressive. Jisoo too is doing amazing. In the past, they've only stuck to elegant concepts so smirking and looking tough and bad is definitely new to them. And when idols change their concept, it's always a hit or a miss with the general audience and fans. Either way I hope Woollim gives them a comeback similar to this stage.

They had their group comeback, then they went on Queendom, and they actually did new concepts that were totally different from their usual style. Kei did her 1st solo album and it was amazing like a Disney song! And she still managed to do that while she’s still working in Queendom and preparing other performances in Immortal Songs! Jisoo honestly showed herself here! I’m sure Woolim will be giving her more parts in their songs after this, she also starred in a drama “One Fine Week” where she was the main actress and her acting was amazing!! She reminds me so much of Yoona, pretty visual, cute and talented!

6876,At the start of the show I started watching as a fan of Mamamoo and now the show has ended I've become a fan of Lovelyz along with the rest of the artist's on Queendom. I'm not a fan of their innocent concept but when they did their cover of BEG they caught my attention and I fell in love with their cover instantly even though they received a lot of hate for it. I'm totally loving this song and I hope their company lets them do more songs like this so I can become trash for Lovelyz as much as I am for Mamamoo. You girls may have not won the competition but you sure did win a new fan and I can't wait to see what you do in the future. #NewFaveSong #NewFan,0.9795,0.058,0.707,0.235,pos

for Lovelyz, u girls have worked hard and we lovelinus are really proud of u girlss! despite your busy schedules you still worked hard to give your all in this show. its okay you didn't win in this competition but you guys have win all our hearts.

7338,"To the people who keep on saying such things,
First, this is Lovelyz style since Destiny era. If you will look closely, this feels like the dark version of Destiny and Night and Day.
Second, don't bring up any groups on the comment section that can start any fanwars. Lovelinus are very much happy to report you to Woollim so you all can pay a million won.
Third, DO NOT DISRESPECT LOVELYZ IN THEIR OWN VID. Simple as that
Fourth, Lovelinus is happy even if Lovelyz didn't won because we saw what Lovelyz is capable of doing. We were so glad to witness Lovelyz having an experimation with different concepts, so it's a win win for us.
