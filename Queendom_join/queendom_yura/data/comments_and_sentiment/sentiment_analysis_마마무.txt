I loved their choreo which is something Mamamoo doesn't have - they're focused more on theatrics. But Mamamoo has everything else, natural stage presence, vocals, and they entertain not just perform. I actually enjoy watching these performances. It's so fun and you see the difference in the group's experience. AOA and Mamamoo exudes stage charisma and self-confidence which I think some of the newer group's lack. For Bom, I think it's just unnerving to be on the stage on her own.

When I look at the evening sunset,
So much I miss you
On days where the wind feels so good,
I… you you you you
When I hear a good song,
So much I miss you
When I watch a good movie, I think of you
I… you you you you
Days that I shared with you
Are not here anymore
On starry nights, always,
(So much~) So much I miss you
When tears silently fall,
I…you you you you (No, no)
Your voice,
So much I miss you
Yesterday and today,
I…you you you you
Your touch that caressed me,
So much I miss you
You used to whine that you missed me
I…you you you you (No, no)
Days that I shared with you
Are not here anymore
On starry nights, always,
(So much~) So much I miss you
When tears silently fall,
I…you you you you (No, no, no)
Your voice,
So much I miss you (So I miss you)
Yesterday and today,
I…you you you you (No, no)
These days, I sleep with tissues instead of you
My phone playlist is filled with sad songs
Because I feel like they’ll
Comfort me like this song
But I miss you
(Traces of you remain in my room,
Covered in tears)
Everyone goes through a breakup
But why am I acting like this?
I’m even worse today
Your whispers, your touch
They’re not here anymore
But I only have you
I miss you
On starry nights, always,
So much I miss you (I miss you)
When tears silently fall,
I…you you you you (I…you you you, No)
Your voice,
So much I miss you (I miss you)
Yesterday and today,
I…you you you you (Oh no, no)
On starry nights, always, (Always oh~)
So much I miss you
(So much I miss you~)
When tears silently fall, (Fall)
I…you you you you (You~)
Whenever (Whenever) Wherever
(Wherever, I miss) (I miss you)
So much I miss you
Whenever Wherever

These days, I sleep with tissues instead of you
My phone playlist
is filled with sad songs
Because I feel like they’ll comfort me like this song But I miss you
Traces of you remain in my room,
covered in tears
Everyone goes through a breakup
but why am I acting like this?
I’m even worse today
Your whispers, your touch
They’re not here anymore
But I only have you
I miss you
On starry nights, always,
so much I miss you
When tears silently fall, I…

so much I miss you
On days where the wind feels so good, I…
you you you you
When I hear a good song,
so much I miss you
When I watch a good movie,
I think of you
 
Days that I shared with you are
not here anymore
 
On starry nights, always,
so much I miss you
When tears silently fall, I…
you you you you
Your voice,
so much I miss you
Yesterday and today, I…
you you you you
 
Your touch that caressed me,
so much I miss you
You used to whine that
you missed me
 
Days that I shared with you are
not here anymore
 
On starry nights, always,
so much I miss you
When tears silently fall, I…
you you you you
Your voice,
so much I miss you
Yesterday and today, I…
you you you you
 
These days, I sleep with tissues instead of you
My phone playlist
is filled with sad songs
Because I feel like they’ll comfort me like this song But I miss you
Traces of you remain in my room,
covered in tears
Everyone goes through a breakup
but why am I acting like this?
I’m even worse today
 
Your whispers, your touch
They’re not here anymore
But I only have you
I miss you
 
On starry nights, always,
so much I miss you
When tears silently fall, I…
you you you you
Your voice,
so much I miss you
Yesterday and today, I…
you you you you
 
On starry nights, always,
so much I miss you
(So much I miss you~)
When tears silently fall,
I…you you you you

Whenever Wherever

While at first it may not seem like Mamamoo is that big in comparison to other mainstream girl group idols because they have more yt views than we do, views at the end of the day isn't what will win awards and gain respect in the industry. Gogobebe already broke a lot of Mamamoo and other music records and they will continue to rise- Moo Moo's fanbase grows bigger and bigger every year and Mamamoo only gets better. It's also sad because back in the day no matter what, there was always an attitude in the kpop community that whether you stan them or not, you need to have respect to older established artists. That attitude unfortunately has seemed to stop for artists who came out around the time of Mamamoo, because there are always fans of groups who have existed for a minute who go around disrespecting their legacy like they haven't worked forever for what they have. I believe girl groups like BP, Gidle, etc will make their own amazing marks on music. They have been killing the scene as newer groups up until now. However, they are still new and are growing. A portion of their fans need to stop letting views and online popularity go to their heads and be respectful towards older established artists instead of dragging them like they haven't worked for years to build the legacy they have now.",-0.0803,0.108,0.791,0.101,neg

They once performed with only a few people and most of them were close friends and family of Mamamoo. So, yes maybe u could say that, but that POPULARITY your talking about is fairly gained by MAMAMOO themselves it didn't happened just in one clicked. They worked hard as hell and show people what they are capable even if they weren't the ""idol image"" people are used to. Furthermore, their fans, us moomoos especially kmoomoos. WOrk hard ass fuck. We promote hard, we vote hard and we show how much we love MAMAMOO even if we still aren't as big of a fandom as once, blinks or armys, we still manage to help promote our girls, like I even created a Instagram Mamamoo fan acc to support them. So rather than spreading hate, I am kindly asking you to SHOW AND SUPPORT YOUR FAV AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. CAUSE YOU SPREADING HATE DOESN'T HELP THEM WIN. Your wasting your time just hating and hating, when you could have been voting, streaming and supporting your idols hard af.

i just watched everyone else's performance and i would like to add something:
I'm staying by what i said. i guess the only one from the other groups who could have compete with mamamoo was g-idle. they had a great set design and theme and the main point of the song was very fitting for the show. they also had some good vocals moment here and there.
however, even now after watching the others, i'm not surprised mamamoo won. 
if you compare the other groups and these two, the others were (noticeable) weaker. and i'm not talking specifically about vocals or dance or whatever, i'm talking about their performance as a whole.
g-idle did a great show. the dancers, the thrones. 
mamamoo just had their dancers and incorporated the audience. no extra props. a little bit of background changes on the screen behind them. and well the camera but i don't it did a lot for the performance. 
they did less show off and just performed as they usually do.

6436,"MAMAMOO got nothing when they started their career. NOTHING AT ALL. Their company even borrowed money just for them to debut. All the things that they have now are the result of their hardwork. Your idols are very lucky to be in a large company but do you think they would survive and would have successful debuts if they weren't? I don't think so. Things will not be the same. (Don't get this statement wrong)
Actually, MAMAMOO deserves more than this but still they are very grateful because they were given oppurtunities like this where in fact, they don't even need to prove themselves.
If you're thirsty for your idols to win, then WORK HARD instead of dragging others down. It's not our fault if we do our best as a fandom because we will do whatever it takes for MAMAMOO to get what they really deserve.
Yes, they might not be able to invest as much as others on their final stage but their vocal ability, stage presence, uniqueness, and connection to the audience is already enough. They don't need thrones, props and everything, they only need their voices, charisma, talent and their audience to make a remarkable performance.
Look at 3:55, they are performing WITH the audience.
They don't try to impress, they express their gratitude to the audience. 
That's how idols, or should I say ARTISTS should be. They are free to express themselves and don't follow anyone's standard.
Edit: This comment is not made to start a fanwar. Yes, it is a little provocative but please understand that I just want to defend my girls. All groups are deserving and for me, all of them won because they were able to show their true colors. Lets just respect each other's opinion and understand that we have our own preferences.

The fact that they didn't have much time to prepare for this stage, due to their VERY tight schedule, attending and performing at award shows here and there, concerts in between, performing in events left and right LITERALLY EVERYDAY, prepping for their comeback this November, Wheein dealing with her anxiety, seriously, they need rest. REALLY. Seeing how much this rewards them, even though they have received even bigger awards from before, truly breaks and flutter my heart at the same time. They have been working they're asses off and still get hate, get bashed,
 One of the most talented groups in SK yet underrated still, gets lesser recognition than more popular girl groups, which I know in my heart they can top off. Let's not lie to ourselves, they are still underrated. But seeing them like this, appreciating everything given to them, and all their fan's works makes my moomoo heart genuinely happy.

The variety of the concepts totally flowed through, which is quite rare. That’s why usually songs are only stick to one concept. At the start of this song, I thought it’s going to be a quite slow paced and Low pitched song, but every part it broke my expectations and took me to another kind of concept.

6620,"AOA surprised the audience for giving a bombastic opening performance. The crowd loved their concept and attitude onstage. First performance = major blast. That was one of the best opening performances in KPOP. 
Lovelyz went out their comfort zones in a whole new dimension of performance. You can't deny that they have an outstanding teamwork. They are equally talented and they left their mark onstage: the shimmer and glamour. That was splendid.
Park Bom is an amazing woman. A woman of power. How can she deliver that soulful performance without crying? Because the crowd was left gasping and wanting for something to go back. The song is gold. It makes you feel broken and complete at the same time. And Park Bom? She has her way to make you feel all of those. Indeed, she's a legend then and now. 
Oh My Girl showed an impactful performance. The audience loved the strength they projected onstage. The looks in their eyes: it was fire. People was inspired by their dedication to their craft. They owned the stage at the very moment of their performance. That was such a strong final act and believably OMG's. 
(G)-IDLE looked majestic. Visually, they had the thickest stage setup with the props and all. They looked extravagant sending off a fiery charisma. Their performance justified their preparation. The energy was outstanding. You can see their hunger to perform and eat the audience live like a lion. They are promising and certainly they can achieve more heights.
Mamamoo was hot and cold. One has given an ample time to show off their own strengths (that as expected, made the audience felt weak). They can give off antonyms for an unknown reason. They can smile then bite. The can summon fire then ice. You expect them to do their best but you are still surprised. Mamamoo just did a Mamamoo. Simple, elegant but oozing with stage presence. Last blow for the stage: and that was a major wreckage. The connection to the audience just came naturally. They broke barriers once again. Again, they are beyond KPOP. 
Now, let us all be reminded that Queendom (how much we doubted and hated it at first) maybe has its message: empower women. 
So why bring other women down when in fact the 6 groups uplift each other? 
Toxicity kills the truest message. This show is more than a competition- it's more on celebrating women's strength and passion. 
So why spread hate? Join the force because every woman in Queendom deserves the crown as what Moonbyul said.

I was a little hesitant in wanting to watch as I didn't like the concept of the show pitting female artist's against each other but I was so curious to see what you would bring to the table. I'm so glad my curiosity got the best of me because not only did you deliver each week with your vocals, stage presence and charisma but you also exposed groups to me that I never knew I needed nor knew existed. I started watching this show as a fan of Mamamoo and Park Bom but now the show has ended I'm a fan of all the contestants involved and I can't wait to see what everyone does in the future. Congrats again Mamamoo for winning the show and congrats to G Idle, AOA, Lovelyz and OMG for winning over a new fan.

They're the only group I loved deeply also almost Cassie but Idk the spark stopped but it doesn't mean I don't like TVXQ. I still love them but not that much affection as I had with MBLAQ.

Their stage presence and confidence on stage is something very unique of Mamammo. You can't even call them cute, because their persona says otherwise. They exude sexy and sultry personality which give them a very mature image which is uncommon to Korean pop groups where everyone desires to portray a very cute and innocent representation of themselves. Mamammo don't care about that. They do what they want to do (props up to their recording company for allowing them to have every Independence in their musicality as much as they want)  and Mamammo do it the best way they can, always.

The song feels like one massive buildup, as even the chorus doesn't relieve the tension. If anything, the chorus accelerates the song and drives it forward at an even greater speed. But when the bridge came... Wow. I mean that has to be the most well-earned and satisfying explosion of sound I've heard from K-pop in a while. 
So many K-Pop girl groups these days have badass, powerful concepts with loud but tasteless drops in the chorus. Mamamoo, as per usual, stick out from the crowd and takes the road less traveled.

ALL GROUPS ARE DESERVING TO WIN. THE MOMENT THEY WERE INVITED TO COMPETE IN THE SHOW MEANS THAT THEY ARE WORTHY. SO STOP BEING IMMATURE DRAGGING OTHER IDOLS DOWN JUST TO UPLIFT YOUR STANS CAUSE IT WON'T DO ANYTHING GOOD.
To defend my ladies (MAMAMOO), they are deserving like any other group. First of all, they worked hard. They were be able to get a strong fanbase and to capture the hearts of many because they chose to be different, artistic, and they really love music. They are destined to be a performer. THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN SONGS. THEY WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS. For some that are not satisfied by them, who thinks they don't do complex choreos and do not sound like other trendy k-pop songs, well, that's MAMAMOO. They don't follow anyone's standard so get over it.
If you do not like their musicality or maybe because it's simply too much to handle, I understand BUT dragging them down and saying that they're not talented and undeserving is UNACCEPTABLE.
Yes, they got the least to gain from this show but THE SHOW IS NOT ABOUT WHO ""NEEDS"" TO WIN.
All groups are very lucky to be able to show their true colors and to highlight themselves, and all of us should appreciate this wonderful chance to be able to witness these.
Our idols are very grateful for this kind of oppurtunity. I am sure that for them, winning is only a bonus achievement, what they truly got from this show is FRIENDSHIP and IMPROVEMENT.

4. Mamamoo was able to change when they were going to perform (could've performed 1st since they performed 1st for Decalcomanie and Good Luck or could've performed 4th due to the 'good luck charm' for performing 4th - they won the mini challenge for shaking off sticky notes

7240,"I'm an international fan, I first encountered Mamamoo because of Park Bom's song which featured Wheein, that is then when I got curious about her and found out about Mamamoo. 
In that very simple statement, what you actually don't see, is that Mamamoo, is not actually (much) ""KNOWN"" internationally. This is for those telling me that Mamamoo is not underrated. Yes, they might not be underrated in SK, but tbh in my country, whose people are engaging massively in Kpop industry, most of them don't even know Mamamoo. 
Sad truth, millions of views count, it does count, it's a huge part of what sells nowadays, its considered a great portion of what it is to be deemed ""KNOWN"". You cannot reason out that people don't have time to stream because that's not how it works. Today, it is what the industry is about, attracting people, consumers, ones who'll buy the albums, stream on chart sites, etc..thus it is vital for all artists and idols. These shows are good for PR, but is it enough? Yes, being looked up by the other contestants is good, but is that enough to say that a group is not underrated? Will that change their international branding? NO. 
And I know Mamamoo themselves told us moomoos to be calm, and be happy for all their achievements, but I will never stop saying they are ""UNDERRATED"" like it's a sin to actually realize what's really happening right now, until they get vastly recognized. I will not swallow my pride and settle for this, I will not be ignorant, for I know in my heart, MAMAMOO DESERVES MORE. They deserve ALL the great things, they deserve to be more recognized in South Korea, and moreover internationally, with their huge amount of talent they even deserve it more than other/some well known groups, who relies mostly on popularity. 
I know it is because RBW isn't capable of promoting them properly, but these girls have been working so hard for years, they started from scratch, paved their way, it's all taking time but I hope it will all immensely pay off someday. 
If only I have a huge amount of riches, I will promote them so hard it will b*tch slap all those haters and bashers. Haha. Kidding aside.  I will promote them so much that the world will get a chance to see how wonderful and marvelous they truly are.

7356,"So... this is gonna be long. 
Honestly I’m not a big fan of winning over popularity because, like many things in life, not because you win/lose something does it mean you truly deserved it. However, in this case, the popularity win was incredibly deserved, you cannot deny that. Why? Simple: our queens worked their asses off for years to achieve where they’re now. (MooMoos also worked incredibly hard but our main motivation was them) Of course a group from a small company is gonna have it harder than big company’s, again, that doesn’t mean that the ones for the big company don’t go through the same effort. 
Everyone did amazing in the competition. Stop fighting and bringing each other down. Yes, everyone deserved the title and I wouldn’t be mad if someone else had won. 
But I don’t know, the reason why stared liking Mamamoo the way I do is because they are different (not in the cliché way) you can just feel the connection through their music/performances. And that’s what an artist is truly like. It HAS to move you. 
They can make you feel fire inside with without even doing much. I feel like sometimes people want a performance with a lot going on(where it can come off as messy) but I think there are times when is quality over quantity and just because something is simple doesn’t mean that there’s not beauty in that. 
Their voices are outstanding, they are gorgeous, their presence is just undeniable. Everyone knows that. 
That being said, I really want to say so many things, but as a supporter of them I’m so happy and proud. I think our girls need to be proud of themselves the most. They are so amazing.

I don't understand why people would complain that MAMAMOO won just by popularity...
Undeniable, every group stands out, I love all the groups, they all did amazing!

But this performance really gives me all the goosebumps...

If you really wanna talk about popularity, (G)I-dle definitely has more views and likes compared to MAMAMOO (I watch (G_I-dle  too, because I love their performance too, such talented girls).
Please stop saying MAMAMOO won JUST by popularity... just acknowledge their hardwork and talent... There's no need to bring down other groups just because your bias didn't win...

Like what Moonbyul says, everyone is a winner.
Let's just appreciate how all six groups bring joy to the audience.

I love MAMAMOO and was interested in (G)I-dle since LATATA, they brought me to watch this show, and I'm delighted to see Park Bom (2ne1 is the group that makes me fall in love with kpop), surprised with AOA's charm (such cute personalities and cool performance), amazed by OH MY GIRL's wholesome performance (plus they have extremely friendly vibe), motivated by Lovelyz's positivity (they are so daring to challenge themselves through different genre).
P/s: Agreeing to what Marylin Urquieta(from the comment section) says: ""our queens worked to achieve where they are now"".
P/s 2: Please stop complaining that MAMAMOO didn't dance as much compared to other groups... First, they dance and looks incredible with their moves... Second, dances are cool, but they are called singer, singing comes first, if they feel more comfortable with these types of choreography to sing, let them be!

Also the other contestants' performances are too messy with too many dancers or their dancers' clothes simply match them. I can't even tell the difference between the idols or the dancers anymore. Glad mamamoo wore white while the dancers wore black.
