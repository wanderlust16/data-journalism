1195,"Still there are people who post here saying they didn't drug Park Bom. It's so sad and heartbreaking that I don't want to take it out. Since Park Bom debuted in the United States
The four types of amphetamines included in Ether, a drug prescribed for the treatment of ADD by ADD, are intended for therapeutic purposes to avoid hallucination / pleasure effects. Not a drug It's not a medicine for that purpose. There are many different types of amphetamines, but the general public, who lacks expertise, tends to identify methamphetamine and amphetamines, which are usually taken for hallucination / pleasure purposes. Ether does not contain amphetamines with strong pleasure / psychedelic effects such as methamphetamine. It is a US FDA licensed drug. Park Bom's diagnosis is ADD, so there is no reason to take drugs, and there is no insane doctor who prescribes drugs to a healthy person. However, as there is a risk of addiction / dependence due to psychological and arousal effects, it is randomly classified as 'narcotics' in Korea and regulated under the Narcotics Management Act. 'Drugs' and 'drugs' are quite different concepts. Classification as 'narcotics' does not mean that non-drug ingredients or drugs become drugs. In 2010, it was an issue in customs clearance without customs declaration, and it was found to be negative on drug test in the investigation based on the psychotropic psychological grade at that time and it was taken as prescription without overdose. In other words, the prosecution receives a ""nothing in conflict with the law."" After that, we will move the hospital to a domestic hospital and change the medicine to a domestic distribution drug. By the way, this suddenly burst four years later in 2014, without any professional knowledge in this field (I know that the beginning of the Chirashi was a world day), and without any medical / legal scientific verification, it was a crappy report ("" The drug that Park Bom took and shipped in Korea without customs declaration was found to be a serious drug even though it was a therapeutic purpose. How can the drug import case be suspended? This is a prosecution investigation for YG at the prosecutor's office. Witch hunting with family drug gang, drug smuggling, and YG-finding investigation is the Park Bom Drug Scandal. There's a lot of talk about why who buried the best top star of the time and disbanded the best legend group 2NE1 with such a ridiculous mass of media and public opinion agitation. I will use only facts here. For reference, there are people who confuse ADD and ADHD. Unlike ADHD, ADD has nothing to do with aggression, violence, impulse. If you look at Park Bom, you are totally mellow. I'm crying and throwing stones at people all over the world. The wounds and traumas of the heart that have been torn. I can't imagine how great the fears and fears of the world and people are. It's not something that an individual can afford. Nevertheless, I said, ""I love singing so much and I want to be loved by singing.""
(Additional) I read the comments below, so many people confuse it and add more. Not drugs in the US become drugs in Korea, and drugs in Korea are not drugs in Europe. Drugs are defined by precise academic definitions and standards. Ether or the four types of amphetamines contained in it (Amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, and dextroamphetamine sulfate) are not drugs. Being regulated under the Narcotics Control Act, non-drug drugs are not recognized as drugs in Korea. Park Bom made a negative on a drug test conducted at the time of customs clearance in 2010. If Ethereal is a drug in our country, then the drug test came out at that time. Some of you talked about the cold medicine and ethereal mixed with codeine, and codeine is a serious drug. It's a different dimension than the amphetamines in the ether. I'll give you an example to make it easier to understand. The drug ""NyQuil"" is a common cold medicine that can be purchased without a prescription in the United States (also available online shopping). However, there is a risk of poisoning / dependence due to the psychotropic effect of dextromethorphan, which is contained in the inner quench, and is regulated by the Narcotics Management Act in Korea. It is common in the US, but in the same context as regulated Ether in the country. That's not to say that Nyquill is a drug or a drug in Korea. Even if you have obtained Nyquin from a foreign country and shipped it to Korea, you will be caught at customs clearance just like the Ether unless you declare it in advance. That doesn't mean the person reverses the stigma of drug or smuggling. However, if the media cleverly deflects the use of drug use and drug trafficking and various plausible grounds, the drug Nyquill or Dextrose Metropan is unfamiliar and the general public who does not have expert knowledge believes only the information exposed to the media. Will be. The scandal at that time was provocatively inflated in that way, and unlike the scandals that received the enormous attention of the public, the process that turned out to be misrepresented and derived from false grounds was quietly outside the public's interest. It's going on, so many people still don't know the truth. In fact, it is not uncommon for a general person who does not know about the Narcotics Control Act to take customs in foreign countries from customs clearance. This is because the Narcotics Management Act contains nearly 200 psychoactive ingredients in addition to 'drugs.' This information is difficult for the general public to access, and it is difficult to understand even if it is not common sense. When this issue occurs in customs clearance, the procedure will be followed according to the psychological level set for each drug, and if the investigation confirms that it violates the law, that is, 'other than therapeutic use', it will be recognized and punished. . Park Bom was investigated according to the procedures at the time of the customs clearance issue in 2010, had a negative voice on the drug test, and found it to be taken as a prescription without overdose. On the contrary, all of us who have been buried in the past five years, buried and thought of the damage and wounds suffered by Park Bom couldn't protect her and stood on the side of a cowardly ignorant violent majority who were indiscriminately bombed at one person who were too fragile. It is necessary to admit and repent. That is a sin of great ignorance. I think it's the way to be forgiven and to care for her more than ever before, to care for her with warm heart, and to help her focus on singing as soon as possible.
(Finally) Some people speak bystander like others' work. However, there is no way that this terrible thing can happen again, when a good person becomes a sinner and is forgotten and forgotten in this world by someone powerful or by the tyranny of the press. Is it something that will never happen to us or to those we care about and love? Unfortunately, what I felt when I looked at the Park Bom scandal was that it wasn't. One innocent man could be buried and forgotten so simply. What if you become a party to such a thing? Aside from the big and small, the helping hand will be eager.

Park Bom seems to be weak because he's warm ... I don't know mentally healthy people, but I can't live without a neuro stabilizer once a week because I have a headache.
So when the problem broke out for the first time, people were so insulted that they were so insulted. Someone who hasn't really felt sick doesn't know .. The progress of science related to psychiatry is so insignificant, and the cause of the terrible headache that devours my daily life is that no one has yet found it. I understood.

Bom did tap-tap the microphone and took a rest for a phrase without singing (I think it was a signal for mic error, mic change, or music stop). It seemed that Mnet decided to proceed the music without any changes. Mnet is really thinking that they would cover their critical mistake without any apology or official announcement? In Korea, many people are shooting criticism about Bom's poor vocal cause they did not catch mic error and they just think that the poor sound was  Bom's fault (shortness of breath and being easily out of tune).

For her, I know she's not there for competition but she just wanted to share her music, talent and most of all she just wanted to enjoy every performance she's doing.

I highly disprove of the rankings Park Bom has gotten on this show. She has been absolutely wonderful with performances. I'm biased, but if this is Queendom, not Princessdom, Bom should win automatically.

I think Queendom need to make  group and solo version competition in different season.
I mean, they make similar challenge like Produce but they include solo artist. How unfair it is. Eventhough Bom give many chance card, it's still unfair. Group power with solo power different. Even if she give her best performance, if the audience looking for massive impact performance with act, it's hard for Bom.
It's not like I hate Bom or the groups or the programs. But I think the competition format need to be change.

Unpopular Idea: Bom’s voice hasn’t been damaged over the years... Yes she sounds different than audition- but ALL voices mature with age. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with YG making her sing in her higher register during 2ne1, but she isn’t using her higher register as much in 2019. So OF COURSE she is sounding different from a)signing lower and b)having her voice naturally mature since 2008. 
This is why I hate reading comments saying how her voice was damaged! No her technique may not have been the best. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it damaged her voice... again, unpopular opinion",-0.8655,0.192,0.691,0.117,neg

Think about it in 10-15 years the young girls of the other groups will be singing their own version of Wanna go back.

She also saying she misses her fans and we were always by her side  . About the dancing thing of her ‘twin’ I think she’s saying sorry I couldn’t make music from her feelings and heart   instead of this yg music with these catchy dances because it was just a show for almost a brand and money , she also can’t look at her ‘old self /twin ‘because she doesn’t like it (obviously) and it was not her real self, also pointing out the twin/old self was darker which maybe means she was sad at those times  , and as you can see kind of in the video it’ll never be fully her .she also says she trying to hold on to US (the fans)so basically hoping  we won’t leave here. She can’t go back to us when we were waiting for her and maybe she feels like she wanted time and that’s the reason why she wants to turn back time .",-0.0387,0.053,0.894,0.053,neu

6823,"i’ve been having on repeat this song since it came out, somehow i knew what she wanted to tell us through the lyrics and the performance confirmed my theory.
she’s talking to her old-self and to the girls, everything she’s been through, the bad and happy moments she embrace everything. 
that bittersweet feelings of wanting to go back in time will forever remain inside every human being, but at some point in your life, you have to move on and look forward, especially if you’ve been burned out really badly by life. and i think that’s what bom did in queendom, she started with you and i and ended this journey with wanna go back, she will always remember her career and her time with 2NE1 as happy memories but now it’s time for her to shine solo, to show everyone that she is not a bad person, she’s more than just a kpop idol.
also someone on twitter pointed out how the clock ticks 13 times back which would take her to 2006, when she first started singing as park bom from yg and at that point she rise dancing (randomly if you will) the in the club choreo. 
2NE1 debuted in 2009, as we’re leaving 2019 and entering 2020, i think everything will be different for bom, she has a new life now, a new agency, she made new friends through queendom and she has her music career back, which she worked so hard for.
i’m happy, this competition did good to her, she’s once again a new bom, ready to embrace a new path with so many new memories waiting for her in the future, keep on singing bom, we’re proud of you!",0.9623,0.049,0.846,0.106,pos

1. Who composed the song? The lyrics is just too precious. And whenever the word Goodbye is mentioned, my mind just flashbacks to the last mv of 2ne1-Goodbye (2017). This is probably my 2nd saddest song after Goodbye.
2. Who planned the whole production? It’s an EPIC TRIBUTE to a LEGENDARY GROUP not just a performance. Every detail is a poignant memory for us who have been with them since the beginning.
> first part where she is looking into the mirror and reminiscing her past self, where she was at her peak performance or maybe we can call it MONSTER ROOKIES era  (when she dances and she was at her healthiest bodywise, but the choreo reminds me of i love you era but not exactly the same )
> second part when she joined the ICONIC MICROPHONE since their Nolza concert, their SIGNaTURE HAiR from MAMA 2015 and ROYAL ATTIRE from AON world tour opening which is black and gold.
>third part where everything was combined into one:
1. the silver cloth and maybe the silver attire which is the color and lettering of 2ne1 first album.
2. Ofcourse her green microphone since 2010
3. Her hair color and her pose while being raised is all from MAMA 2015
4. In the club choreo
5. The lights dancing in the air reminds me of the final part of Crush MV when they were shouting Nolza with fistpumps in the air and they were also elevated from others.
6. Her final pose. I’ve been searching but have never seen HER do this pose. BUT in every final pose of 2ne1 in their performances, it’s either they all line up with 2NE1/LOVE(from DYLM era) hand sign OR one of them is doing this pose while the other 3 are standing in the back. I have seen CL with this pose for Fire, Dara in Gotta be You and Minzy for MAMA 2015. This is the only time I see Bom with this pose probably because she is known to wear short skirts.

I don't blame Minzy for not renewing her contract, and I'm certainly not blaming any 2ne1 members I just honestly thought YG could've handled the situation properly instead of debuting a new group (yes, Blackpink, I'm sorry for bringing them here) to cover YG's inability to properly take care of his artists. 

I miss 2ne1, and 2ne1 misses itself too - and it clearly shows. Park Bom's performance here has been the culmination of all that. We witness what she feels like from her perspective through her music. Whenever we listen to sad songs, we always CANNOT AVOID correlating it with her missing her group.

I've always been a silent person when it comes to the comment section, but seeing as this is the final performance and she dedicated this to her members as well as acknowledged the fact that she is now a SOLOIST, I'm just so happy that she took the leap of faith and the courage to start from scratch. It's not an easy thing to do, from being recognized as one of the best in the industry to going bacm from scratch where she has to make people pay attention to HER ALONE. I'm just so happy that she went back to music, and I'm so happy I came back to music because of her. She's my inspiration since 2008.",0.9931,0.074,0.734,0.192,pos

7144,"Well, that would win the show for me if I was in charge. All the groups did great, but Bom certainly is the standout, with a special voice and an iconic past. The performance was rife with messaging about what she has gone through, her past, present and future. Her singing is just absolutely wonderful and the meaning behind it all only elevates it to the next level. When she throws the mic at the end, it's a powerful statement, but bitter sweet moment. As the song says, she wishes and would give anything to go back to when 2NE1 were together, but she is starting to accept that they are not and she has a chance to continue alone, for now.
There are more technical singers in this contest, but every performance Bom has done has had weight to it, something I can't say I've seen from other groups separate of her. I'm certainly biased in that regard, but I really feel despite rankings, Bom is a true winner here. After, essentially, 5 years away from the scene, she has dropped new music, performed solo against a bunch of groups, formed some bonds with the younger singers and really recaptured a lot of that spectacle and confidence to perform, while challenging herself to sing songs she'd never sung.

7220,"This stage is EPIC.   LEGENDARY.  
For those who are unfamiliar with the technical details of a live stage:  at 1:37, Bom Unnie starts having problems with her in-ear monitor.  This small earbud provides the music to the singer, so they can clearly hear what is happening on stage.  Please continue watching and notice Unnie's earpiece, which falls off completely at 1:53, just as the high note portion of the song begins, and the energy of the song is starting to build up.   This is the worst time to lose the audio feed.  
Still, Bom sings, emotes, owns the stages and doesn't show the audience the problem At this point, she cannot hear her backing audio clearly, and she is ""singing blind"".  At 2:50, Unnie has a break in the music and she discreetly tries to put her earpiece back in.  At 2:55, you can see her fumble desperatly with her earpiece, she cannot place it easily because her gorgeous nail art is in the way.  The high note is coming and she risks going out of pitch without her audio feed.  Also, at this point, she is already standing on the platform which will rise her up above the audience just as the song reaches its crescendo.  She doesn't want to miss the note and she is nervous for the finale that is coming. 
Even without her earpiece, she nails the high note at 3:26.  And the dance solo that follows - despite probably not being able to hear clearly.  This is the result of years of experience in front of an audience, and all the talent she has.  All hail the queen.  
TLDR:  Bom's earpiece fell out at 1:53, she delivers most of the stage without it, including the big high note.  EPIC.",0.5111,0.065,0.859,0.076,pos

7508,"To happen to put an artist as talented and creative and so filled with emotions in a show like this is such an amazing experience!! Park Bom was always the sweet soul in 2ne1 knowing that it a girl crush powerful girl group but she always succeeded in making it all fade and create the ballance we all fell for with her magical angelic vocals!

I'm so glad she's got to show how emtional she is! how talented she is! and how ready and preapred she is to give it all when it comes to things she loves and appreciates starting with her most beloved group 2ne1!!
I couldn't help but cry and smile at the same time watching this cuz I know as a 2nd gen Kpop fan how is it for all of us, how do we feel.. cuz Kpop is not like any other Music industry.. we get hurt and miss our faves so much!! it sometimes lead to depression and extreme sadness because as we grew up, we were always casted out and only KPOP made us feel there's something fun and colorful and amazing to live up to and feel happy and enjoy!!

I'm so happy she's doing her best to relive all of that and can't help but be happy for her and support her from the bottom of my heart cuz she deserves that!! she really does!!
