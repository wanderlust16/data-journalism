Who else just had to come back to see this for the hundredth time?
=
Haters: AOA is nothing without choa            AOA : Bring our miniskirts and chairs
=
AoA: *does the thing*
All the Girls: *Instant gay panic*
=
Fun fact: Seolhyun was in the MV for Miniskirt but could not participate in promotions because of an injury. It's really iconic that years later she can now take the stage and be the center like the song originally intended
=
You have to have true self confidence and maturity to pull off a convincing sexy concept. To the unprepared girl group experimenting this concept for the first time, the result are often clumsy or trashy. By comparison, the cute and girl crush concepts are safer and easier to pull off. The sexy concept requires looking alluring and confident. AOA showed us here that this is their core concept.
=
I JUST REALIZED HOW HARD IT IS TO DO SEXY CONCEPTS. DO IT WRONG EVERYTHING SEEMS AWKWARD. BUT AOA IS DOING IT RIGHT. QUEEN OF SEXY CONCEPTS
=
Other groups: “Isn’t that a bit too sexy?”
“They unzipped their skirts”
“Woahhh”
AOA: “Girls, watch and learn”
Elvis: “We’re already getting used to watch this performance for years”
=
This is a true sexy concept. Not dirty, not bad, they should never feel ashamed. This is embracing your sensual side. These girls do it PERFECTLY.
I hope more people come to appreciate it because this is art. Amazing
=
aoa said "time to bring out the lesbians" and they really succeeded
=
I still can’t believe this performance didn’t win on the first stage. Like wtf?!! This is the best performance meanwhile the other groups performed like usual comeback stage (not including Gi-dle). I’m sure the voters are blind.
=
AOA: *Starts performing*
Other idols: *shooketh*
Me: Welcome to the mature side of kpop. Take a lesson.
=
I think that this performance is one the most memorable of 2019!
=
No offense but NO ONE is doing it like AOA
=
This can be a MAMA PERFORMANCE LEVEL This is not just a performance alone, it on another level like MAMA
=
AOA: *breathes*
Everyone: *gay panic*
=
They don’t make girl groups like AOA anymore
=
Girls : One is missing
Chanmi : Surprise Mother......
=
aoa: you boys can grow up now
knetz: 
aoa: you're welcome
=
When seunghee said “but are you really” i felt that
=
This show is fucking everything, i don't care about the competition at all,but this show brings back alot of memories from the golden year of kpop, covering other groups songs , has a well made dance break, and make a really spectacular performance, ugghh i miss the old days
=
This is one of the most amazing moments in Kpop history
=
I feel like AOA has always been that Kpop girlgroup that is objectified and underestimated. This performance is like their way of reclaiming their power on their own sexiness and image. It is a real power move.
=
When 2019 MAMA f*cked up.
I just comeback here to watch this amazing performance....
=
In 2019 AOA invented the chair dance.
=
yuna got those high notes on LOCK YES SIS
=
Yuna kills.  Her voice, movements, and facial expressions just slay.  Wow.
=
Why do they have to repeat the reaction every time?
=
AOA out here teaching the younger generation of KPOP how to PROPERLY slay the sexy concept.
=
the other girlgroups: *panicking*
Mamamoo & Bom: Let's enjoy this~
=
this is 5 minutes and 12 seconds of mamamoo, gidle, lovelyz, and oh my girl being proud lesbians for aoa 
=
Funny game of contrasts - AOA makes most of the other groups seem like children in comparison, and they were probably the same age or younger than the rest when Miniskirt first came out!
They've got Mature + Sexy locked down and they've had the crown for years
=
It's crazy... just mini skirt stage original already sexy but this stage more more sexy... yeokshi AOA.. sunbae feel..it's different.
=
aoa jimin face is got matured like all of them
=
me: how much are you gonna watch this 

my brain: *YES*
=
Personally felt like their stage was the most exciting to watch
=
aoa’s sexy concept is one of the best. it’s so classy, never the whore-ish vibe. aoa is the reason why i’m picky with such a concept 
=
Everyone: Holds their skirt and gliding over the dancer's legs while doing a half-turn

Jimin:  *SKIP* *SKIP* *SKIP*
=
MY QUEENS ARE BACK THEY SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN 1ST IN THAT PRELIMARY
=
Aoa preparing for this performance: "We're gonna give the gays everything they want"
=
4:30

Yuna: I'm getting exhausted
Seunghee: But are you really?!

I'M DYING LMAO
=
AOA: aight lets bring the inner gays outta these girls
=
Soojin's face: man i wanna join them...
=
Im sorry gidles may have been cool and mamamoo may have been catchy but Honestly i feel Like AOA stole this one from them for me
=
This is the best performance on Queendom
=
This is still the best performance of Queendom PERIOT

AOA QUEENS
=
AOA is just so captivating! I can't remember how many times I've watched this already,  but still I'm mesmerized by them every single time.
=
_My short legs and fat thighs _*_can’t_*_ relate_
=
Like Miniskirt wasn't already THAT song, Aoa does this
=
*ALL HAIL TO THE QUEENS* *ACE OF ANGELS*
❤❤❤❤❤
=
3rd gen girl groups are shooktthhhh
=
Me: Yea this video seems good
**Watches Video**
**Falls Off Bed**
=
aoa: *breathes*
all the girls: *gay panic*

we need an aoa comeback.
=
I can't take my eyes of Jimin she slayed all the girls did
=
omo my second generation heart
=
Still coming back to this performance after queendom ended cuz this is a legendary level performance. I need more AOA!!!!
=
it‘s been two months and i’m still captivated by this performance
=
Please support aoa after this performance, aoa is in need of a comeback
=
all i can think of when i watch this performance: THEY ARE ACTUAL ANGELS. THEIR BEAUTY AND CHARM IS UNREAL.
=
“AOA DROP IT”

- Jimin 2019
=
For this entire performance I could see their tears. How hard they're working after losing a member. How badly they wanted to show that they're worthy of support. I could see all of it. They're working very hard so please support them even if you aren't a Stan. I'm so sorry I didn't notice you girls until now.
=
QUEENDOM MADE ME STAN AOA HARDER THAN BEFORE! THIS SONG IS ONE OF THE BEST SEXY ANTHEMS IN KPOP.
=
Best performance ever KPOP
=
Their first major stage as 5 AND they brought back the banned zippers. Absolute queens
=
i still cannot get over this performance... who's with me?
=
I'm a long time AOA fan. Although I miss Mina and Choa, it gives the remaining ladies more time to shine in each song and they seem to rise to the challange, especially Chanmi. They are performing at a high level on this show like they have something to prove! And they do prove it!
=
Yuna's eyes man, they tell stories
=
4:30 "are you really exhausted?" IM DEAD
=
it’s so nice to see people commenting great things about AOA instead of commenting things about other groups that lead to fanwars. we stan all
=
I love queendom because I got into Gidle and AOA through it. How is AOA so hilarious XD
=
0:11 Yuqi so cute❤❤❤
=
Only 1st and 2nd Generation are doing this concept this Generation everything is EDM miss it Aoa we need a comeback
=
I need help... I can't seem to stop coming back to see this gorgeous,amazing and elegant performance
=
This is literally the MAMA Performance we never had on 2014. This is too good
=
They're sexies without even trying so hard to be I mean their facial expressions, their moves, their vocals...etc
=
when years ago the tv can't take the sexiness of AOA...   there are the only group that i know  can do so sexy concept in there era and now.
=
4:48 THE BEST MOMENT HEHE :-)))
=
AOA you’re the best
=
The original sexy queens, they made a woman like me drool
=
really am appreciative of AOA’s main dancer Chanmi! That dance break though !!
=
Omg, they're in other level, I really missed them. T-T.
=
I died when Hyejeong lay down.
=
when soyeon said "ooOoOOOOOoOoooOoOOOh" i felt that
=
I cried watching this. They’ve been through so much as a group but everytime they go on stage they still shine so brightly and perform so well:)
=
Who's here after AOA's new comeback?
=
I see Jimin in completely different light now after her PUSS performance 
=
Honestly, I was blown away by this performance. I've always loved AOA and I'm so proud of them for proving, once again, that they deserve the spotlight in the Kpop industry. True queens ❤️
=
Who here remembers the skirt unzipping was actually part of the original choreography but was later omitted because it was deemed too sexy for TV broadcast?
=
why do I keep replaying this everyday?? their choreo and voice are so addictive.
Oot, I need more jimin with long hair 
=
To be honest this is a classy performance  i guess korea is different.
=
They better comeback after this show cuz sis I AM READY FOR A COMEBACK FNC 
=
One thing I realised abt this performance is that no member outshines another and I love it
=
For me, of all the stages in Queendom so far, this one is still the best
=
Hey pls look a moonbyul face  1:25
=
how quickly they forget, the OG queens of kpop
=
THIS SHOULD HAVE WON
=
Hyejeong's opening line might be the most right thing happened in this song.
=
!!!! Someone ARREST Seolhyun!!!!!
She is f**king gorgeous! I can’t look away!!
=
other KPOP groups watching them became GAY AF! hahahahaaha!
=
These ladies are on a different type of sexiness. They’re oozing with it!!! ❤️❤️❤️
=
All we know when jimin say “AOA” they’re gonna slay it
Can they just comeback with elegant sexy concept like this??? I miss AOA so much.
=
I watched this so many times that i even know the dance
=
This is one of the best performance in Queendom. It’s already 2 months past but I keep watching this. Epic
=
Why do I keep on coming back here? This is really my favorite performance
=
"AOA DROP IT"
OMG I SCREAM A LOT.
=
The sexy queen are finally back!!!!! seolhyun's visual is breathtaking
=
I'm so glad they did Miniskirt since it was my most favorite song of AOA. And i hate the live version that change the choreo. So glad they did the original choreo. 

After Queendom ends, I'm still stuck here
=
Jimin : AOA drop it
Me: Lose blood
=
I feel sorry for people who joined kpop after miniskirt, short hair, like a cat or even heart attack era
=
i really miss this kind of kpop omggg throwback 2012-16 era aoa sistar kara secret 4minute missA many more idonteven remember lmao
=
Mv Project for AOA "Come See Me" 3M in 24Hours
Please help us to make this comes true
=
The most sexiest performance I've ever seen.
=
Damn that beat drop at 4:26 was smooth...
=
IM HERE SINCE AOA DEBUT UNTIL NOW AND I CANT SAY NOTHING I AM JUST SOSOSOOSOS PROUD THOSE ARE MY GIRLS YALL BEEN SLEEPING ON FOR YEARS ✊✊✊✊
=
That little Jimin has such amazing stage presence! HECK, ALL OF THEM DO!! Slay girls love the new comeback
=
IDOLS WATCHING AOA DANCING : 
* Blushing *.
 * Jaws dropping  * 
( Lesbian mode on ) LOL ...
Me : I see you, girls
=
THE QUEEN IS BACK !!!
=
They ,set the whole stage on fire 
=
Watching this for hundreth times & never get bored of it
=
This AOA line up is something different. It's like watching a new group.
=
Ahh! They always have me questioning my sexuality. I’m totally turned gay for this performance.
Chanmi killed the show with her dance.
=
Sensual, erotic but done in a tasteful, inoffensive way by stunning looking ladies !!! It was a good song too for anyone who didn’t notice !!! 
=
Damn I just wish they release an audio for this version!! I keep coming back to watch this and at the same time just listen to this version of miniskirt!! AOA FIGHTING!!
=
AOA was one of the main reasons why I got into Kpop and I haven't seen a video with them in so long. This just makes me so happy. :((
=
AOA is the last remaining sexy girl group of the old generation and this performance proved that they are the supreme QUEENS of sexy girls groups and that's a fact. Wish them the success they deserves.
=
Bro this performance is way better than original ❤️
=
Everyone's reaction when they unzip the skirt is hilarious!
=
They're another level to sexy concept
=
World class entertainers right there
=
I wanna see this show with my eye. Come to Thailand please i want aoa tour haha
=
Chanmi´s Solo Dance is so AMAZING .
=
I keep coming back to this cuz like, I missed aoa man
=
That was the longest 5 minutes of my life 
=
Seunghee’s reactions are my favorite part of the whole show
=
A song without jimin's hey isn't an AOA song
=
Jimin stated that "hey" shout is hers, once again ^.^
=
2:16 ok she got my all attention 
=
omy this performance is so addictive
=
I think this one of AOA best performance!

=
can’t stop laughing when I look at Jimin face LoL too cute for swag :))
=
0% dirty
100% sexy
150% classy
200% talent
This is AOA we love
=
This is one of my favorite songs by AOA and this rearrangement is so good, I love the added instrumental solo it just fits so well with the song and their performance made everything amazing. I love everything about it <333
=
Legends 

P E R I O D T
=
Proof that AOA is still the orginal sexist concept group!
=
AOA deserve be the number one.
=
THE BEST STAGE OF ROUND 1 <3
=
We all know that we became a gay becausr of AOA
=
i can see they give space for mina and choa in this perfom :")
=
3:53 ... jimins professionalism... ✊✨♥️
=
Chanmi and jimin 
=
And now, the Angels are back! 
=
Although they didn't win, but they win in our heart! This stage get many attention than the others.
=
THEY CAN STEP ON MY FACE AND I'D SAY THANK YOU
=
1:26 when solar not around
=
why are jiho's reactions so precious
=
FNC should really consider recording a studio ver of this and releasing it it's such a refreshing remix.
=
"isn't that a bit too sexy?!" 
my mind the whole video lol 
=
Wondering where's jimin tattoo.. it's gone all of sudden
=
" hey "
=
My opinion for the first round:
6. Lovelyz
5. Bom
4. Oh My Girl
3. Mamamoo
2. (g)-idle
1. Aoa
I think AOA's performance is the best from the first round. I can't believe how they ended up in rank 4 this round
=
1:30 love her smile.
=
This is what makes me question my ENTIRE life My Ace Of Angels
=
The bisexual me is killing me right now! 
OMG GIRLS ARE GORGEOUS ❤!!!
=
3:01 hey Shuhua 
=
Seung Hee's reactions are such a mood LOL
=
This might be a shock to some people but sexy concept is literally the shit back then especially in 2nd-3rd kpop groups. We live for these kind of performances 
Take notes kids. This is the real SEXY
=
AOA is THE ONLY QUEEN who can pull this kind of sexy concept and made it look so classy. That's it. Nobody argue with me.
P/s: Chanmi can slaps me in the face with her heels
=
1:57 hyojung so cute
=
And Girls.....that is how you cleaned mnet dirty floor elegantly !!!!!
=
oh my girl seunghee is the reaction queen HAHAHHAHA
=
I honestly think this was the best performance
=
wished they added this remix on spotify. it's soooo good!
=
their doing sexy concepts perfectly
=
This is true example of sexy concept!!! AOA so awesome!!!
=
the queens of sexy concept.. miss them
=
I really love them they're more than enough to rock it
=
After watching this for so many times, I can now easily see Jimin & Hyejeong missing a step on that chair dance.
=
1:25
Moonbyul: *gay wooooooow*
=
I hope mnet will repeat this performance live again..it is worth
=
3:58 same
=
Jimin looks so pretty OMG I really love her
=
AOA KILLED IT BEST PERFORMANCE
=
Lol..I can't believe I didn't notice members were missing. I just read somewhere that they left AOA. THEY'RE SO POWERFUL LIKE NEVER! THEY'RE OUR GIRLS!! FIGHTING QUEENS!
=
I swear, this performance always leaves me speechless. Waiting for a comeback of these talented girls! 
=
Chanmi getting her well deserved dance break solo!
=
THE WAY I SQUEALED
=
they wore high heels and didn't even fall they got superpower i love them
=
Idk how many times I watched aoa performances on queendom THANKS QUEENDOME FOR MAKING ME AN AOA FAN
=
0:47 Moonbyul's face is saying everything 
=
Chanmi looks mature now. She nailed that dance break
=
i'm starting to like AOA OT5 after this performance. well, I'm not saying that I don't miss OT7 ^.^
=
3:53 Jimin's little jumps are so cuuute
=
it's ridiculous how they even get 4th in the 1st prelim performance, wth are the audiences watching?  in the end you know what the artists themselves know the best and both mamamoo and g-idle rank aoa as above them, nuff said.
=
The best perfomance out of all. I dont stan any of the groups joined queendom but this is the best for me
=
 I followed JiminLeader order and dropped my jaw  I'm glad they made some mistakes otherwise everybody would have guessed they are real Angels ❤️
=
1:58 the cute giggles...hahhahaha
=
omg this was wild and I’m now late but also in love
=
I just noticed Jimin made a small mistake at 3:53 
She's so cute!!
=
They truly are angels ❤️ they even brought back the "dirty" dance moves they had to change back in the day lol
=
THIS SHOULD HAVE WON
=
Before there was twice vs blackpink vs red velvet the og summer girl group war was Sistar vs Aoa vs Girls Day !!
=
3:59 eh helloooo there 
=
This is the sexiest performance I’ve ever seen
=
AOA: *breathes*
Everyone: 0:25
=
Short Jimin, I saw what u did there lmaoooo
=
Ok, I have to watch this show
=
Iconic performance for kpop history. AOA are legends!
=
Absolutely LIVING for that Chanmi solo
=
Wowwww i love AOA❤
=
The most important is they even wear high heels to dance and it's soooo stableee !!!
=
SEOLHYUN I LOVE UUUU
=
Everyone just talks about choa no one ever talks about Mina ):
=
AOA is on another level  so proud of Angels
=
I love this version so much. Always support you AOA , Love from Thailand.
=
I dont know how many times I watched this already.. I still cant get over with this Performance.. Im so addicted to it
=
Hater: AOA is disband
Aoa: Look bicth
=
they are really really like a cat
=
Throw all that sexiness aside. All I can see is passion in their eyes. They wanted to remember this stage and all the Queendom activities because it has been so long since they are active as a group and you can see how much they had practiced for this four minute stage. This might be their revival to become active once again or it might be their farewell activity as a group. I don't care the outcome from this show but I wish AOA always happy when doing this till the end.
=
For those who haven’t watched Queendom - this is what one of the members said that got me really sad and sentimental
When Hyejeong said 
“I want to act. I want to be on stage. I want to interact with the fans. I want to still do this and that’s why I am still in FNC” (her company)
=
IS THIS MAMA?? COZ ITS MAMA LEVEL OF A PERFORMANCE!!!
=
everyone is gay for aoa.
=
I like this version better these Queens rulee❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
AOA x sistar is the legend of sexy concept
=
They are sexy without trying too hard. Reminds me of After School vibe
=
aoa drop it!
=
The queens of sexiness is back❤️
=
one of my fave performance <3
=
Even though there is only 5 of them, they still pulled it off so well. Feeling so nostalgic.
=
Even after Queendom I still watch this video...
 Egotistic cover was such a bomb and awesome 
Jimin and Cream performance was really amazing
Sorry was really great and jaw dropping...
But this is the most special for me... Because this is their first performance as 5member group.. And they killed and nailed it...
=
The queens of sexy concepts!!!
=
I'm so Glad my girls are finally being recognized for their amazing Talents. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEYRE 7 YEARS HERE AND PEOPLE JUST NOTICED NOW HOW ICONIC AND LEGENDARY THEY ARE!  FIGHTING MY GIRLS AOA
=
omg hyejeong is so iconic
=
After the finale, this is still my favorite performance!  
=
Seoulhyun THE BEST VISUAL EVER
=
lmao i live for seunghees reactions
=
7M we did it, c'mon to 8M and please streaming 3rd performance too
=
3:03 Shuhua is so me kakakakak
=
OMG slay it girls.
Also Moonbyul is soooo gay ^^
And I want MAMAMOO to do a concept like this *.*
=
I very missed AOA!
=
Although they got 4th place in the first round of competition. I do think they have WON many things. With this performance, they have made their statement that AOA is strong as a 5 member group and that they are serious about their performance. Regardless of the outcome of this competition, with winning many hearts of old and new fans, locally and internationally, AOA will have a marvelous comeback! Good job girls you are on the right track to success.
=
i became AOA fan thru Queendom. so far i like what I'm hearing. to me they are a 5 member group.
=
They pull off the sexy concept SO WELL, I'm shooked
=
Mini Skirt ver 2.0; 2019 ver.
=
Oh my got they are hoooooot !!!! This is new level oh AOA !!!! 
=
1:58 my fav
=
Iam a big fan of mamamoo and ( g)idle but i think AOA was the best!
=
❤❤Perfect
=
I'm so gay for this performance 
=
+ moonbyul literally melting at the start
=
AOA not only talented but all pretty as well , truly perfect !
=
AOA make me crazy, please stop!
=
*AOA unzips skirt*
Moonbyul has entered the chat
=
Flawless!
=
hyejeong  ❤
=
Moon...Solar definitely put you on the couch after that reaction
=
My Reaction for this whole video 3:58
=
lets stream this and let a second queendom to achieve the most viewed perf. lexz go elvis
=
They mf dropped that shiiii ✨
=
3:05: *Me trying to imitate them while watching*
=
3:05 shuhua is so cuteee
=
Honestly it broke my heart that my bias left but AOA is still super strong and will always give the best performances wether it’s 8 member or just a solo
=
They look so hot I’m suffocating
=
Someone help me learn their names! I’m just getting into AOA!
=
Yall better BOW DOWN! To the QUEEN!! ❤
=
THE REAL QUEENS
=
LEGENDS!!!
=
This performance deserves the 1st rank!!!
=
They finally back!!!
=
THEY DESERVE A COMEBACK
=
感謝aoa啊啊啊❤️❤️❤️她們太美麗了
=
New fan in the house. I become a fan after watching this. I have fallen in love with them. 
=
It's been a month and a half and I KEEP COMING BACK
=
AHAHAHAHAHAHA Best reaction!!
=
Chanmi's dance break though 
=
AOA is an amazing girl group. Because of Queendom, i saw some of their performances and all are amazing
=
I'm not a fan of seolhyun but I really respect her. Imagine being a sucessful actress and model yet still continues on becoming a singer with AOA. She has a really nice attitude I can tell
=
My favorite thing about this show is the complete support the girls show to each other. Like, there's no jealousy or mean comments just fangirling.
=
Jimin!!!! ♥️
=
3:04 i died shuhua is comedy gold
=
Where she like the floor 
=
Omg Frankly I do not know what to say but that is very beautiful 
=
3:01 
Expectations
3:03
Reality
=
AOA IS BACK
=
AOA:
Me: Straight no more
=
and this is where you can see everyone having a *gay panic*
=
I'm still watching this once a week
=
AOA is really another level they are amazing
=
MY EYES!!!!
=
0:46 Moonbyul gay panic
=
الفخاااامة 
=
1:42 soyeon 
=
Even the girls go crazy over AOA!
=
where's the studio version FNC? WHERE?!
=
We need this in MAMA 2019!
=
Honestly, no other girl group is better in portraying sexy concept beside AOA and Brown Eyed Girls
=
1:25 MOONBYUL U GAY HO
=
Now that's how u perform....  Awesome.  I was feeling it....
=
03:58 that guy is us
=
My girlssss
AOA
YUNA
you slayed every word and move!!!!! Luv ya 
=
I miss the old era of kpop. 1st gen 
=
AOA didn’t come to PLAYYYY !!! That’s the late 2nd gen of Kpop is capable of 
=
I love the chorus though
=
3:04 me at 2:00 am trying to copy choreo
=
3:26 me all the video
=
They still my angels
=
For me only AOA can do sexy theme.
=
Omg. This is true art. Probably one of the best performances ever in k-pop. Amazing. I hope to see more of them all together. 10/10. Now I’m going to watch it again. And probably again after that.
=
Now this is true sexy.
=
Im today yrs old when i found Miniskirt sounds good with Latin music.
=
Well rehearsed performance, well done..
=
People forget sexy concept was the thing back in 2012-2015 since we have been bombarded with cuteness and girl crush lately. I really appreciate Queendom for letting AOA bring this concept back on the radar.
=
I still think this deserved the n1 spot so much, they were done dirty
=
You don't underestimate AOA!! Loveyou my best girls, 
=
1:25 for gay panic reaction. Your welcome
=
I watched this like 1000 times now they are amazing and we are so blessed to have them back in action. I hope they do come back and if they do I will support them completely. AOA is so talented that even if they have 5 members now i think they will do amazing. ❤
=
I was shook when they opened their zipper since it was banned back then AOA are queens
=
Damn that stage was literally fireeee
=
1:12 what is her name? 
=
My feels. Am I just seeing my new girls fangirl over my girls. I miss AOA so much! We need a comeback.
=
Even though they're OT5 now, you could still feel that they're complete(like a completely different group that has everyone you need from the vocals to the rappers to the dancers and even the visuals and fotg)
=
Ughhhhh my babes are just so talented and finally all get to show what they got Im so proud
=
New generation of kpop groups and fans: what is sexy concept?
AOA & Elvis: this!!!

(this is all i have to say ok)
=
I see the unzipped part coming 
=
Don’t get me wrong I like G idle and I’m definitely a moomoo but u can’t tell me this doesn’t deserve to win. It’s the best performance by far, you can see the love and passion in their eyes when they perform together again.
=
超厲害的！！
完全把這首歌帶到另一個境界！！
=
I really miss this kind of confidence of AOA. I’m a proud ELVIS. I’m hoping with this show that AOA will get back their recognition that they deserve!
=
I’m gay for AOA everyone
=
you should count how much Mamamoo said "they definitely worked/ practiced hard for this" to every performance since beginning
=
1:27 a bigger gay panic
=
They killed me with their beautiful legs
=
THEY'RE JUST ON ANOTHER LEVEL. THEY'RE THE COMPLETE ART. THEY'RE THE ART THEMSELVES !!
KOREA AND KPOP INDUSTRY SHOULD PROTECT PROTECT THESE PRECIOUS ARTS. THEY'RE NOT JUST A RANDOM GIRL GROUP!! 
=
every gg in queendom: *screams in gay*
=
Don't forget to support their new song you guys! It's a bop!
=
0:56 haha. Not for AOA, it isn't.
=
Want to do sexy concept?   Ask AOA to teach you....
=
I’m gay for AOA
=
I thought Mamamoo can easily won. I forget that AOA the real Sexy K-Pop Group 
=
I know after this realityshow AOA will get more fan....love you AOA
=
Oh My Girl ❤️ AOA
=
Kesinlikle performansları muhteşemdi 1. Olması lazımdı haklarını yemişler asıl Queen AOA olmalıydı bizim kalbimiz de AOA kesinlikle 1 numaralı queen 
=
I love how they all turn gay for AOA
=
the oh my girl girls are such a mood
=
⚠️ Oh Hyejeong
=
It makes me really miss my old Kpop songs I’ve really cried
=
seolhyun is a goddess
=
Gdle being fan girl of jimin
=
I see this as the rebirth of AOA
people have been throwing shade at them when Choa left but this proves that they respect Choa's decision and that they can do Miniskirt, their most iconic song without her
And the instrumental drops during Jimin's rap are everything
Chanmi also got to shine
=
Camera-san *LOVES* Seolhyun and honestly I’m so grateful
=
3:03 SHUHUA HAHAHAHAHAH IS A BABY
=
“Isnt that a bit too sexy?” 
Girl thats AOA! 
=
I love moonbyul's reaction
=
Somebody tell me otherwise that seolhyun is the most beautiful being they have ever seen
=
esta performance junto con el cover que hizo Park Bom son mis preferidos <3 AOA secas
=
*i think i'm so gay for this performance*
=
Wow like actually wow♥️
=
0:47 moonbyul, honey, your gay is showing.
=
Ah the groups are so supportive to eachother I the love it
=
oh my i think im gay 
=
THIS WAS SO LEGENDARY ❤️❤️
=
aoa drop it omg！！！
=
All girls auto *screaming* and appreciate the second generation queen stage ️‍
=
They don't make this kinda girl groups anymore. AOA, After School, BEG, Kara and lot more who carrying this concept. Them.
=
Seunghee it's a total meme and mood here
=
Now that's how you execute a sexy concept in a classy way. Miniskirt is one of the sexiest songs in kpop and only AOA can do it.
=
Proud Elvis right here 
=
3:04 HAHAHA shuhua is so adorable
=
4:31 “But, are you really?”  She looked so confused and unwilling to believe that.
=
*i stan harder than before*
=
I'm repeating this from September until now
=
Honestly this performance deserved the 1st spot for me.
=
im Yuqi since miniskirt released in 2014 2:21
=
3:04 Same girl
=
This bring back memories...
=
DEAR FUTURE GIRL GROUPS THAT GONNA HAVE A SEXY CONCEPT , PLEASE LEARN FROM AOA !!!! THIS CLASSY, ELEGANT , UNIQUE, EXPLODING VISUALS EVERYWHERE ....THEY NAILED IT
=
They are back
=
AOA really dropped it huh?
=
where ever they go , AOA always slay with their sexy concept
=
JIMIN : AOA DROP IT

ME : GOOSEBUMPS LIKE CRAZY 
* AOA SLAY IT
=
jiho from OMG freaking looks like rosé, you can't change my mind
=
Outstanding performance  !!!! Shoutout to Seolhyun  Love from Nashville, TN. USA
=
More love ❤️ for AOA!!!
Fighting!!!
=
AOA deserved all the loves from us 
=
かわいい…☺️
=
Who says AOA dies after Choa leaving the group? You all gotta watch this. They slay it!
=
AOA:Let's be sexy while on a chair
Shuhua: Like this 3:03?
=
omg i love this version
=
AoA will always be my queens
=
After I saw QueenDom I loved Aoa❤️❤️❤️
=
Yuna is literally body goals
=
Seolhyun’s visual is no joke, she is still on the top list of k-pop industry.
=
AOA for the win. They make this show worth watching. 
=
Fanboys' reaction are the best.
Fanboy is me.
=
Moonbyul was feeling it lmaooo
=
They deserve to win, or at least get the 2nd place:(
=
jimin
=
I'm falling in love with YUNA
=
1:05
=
I’m officially Gay for AOA
=
has anyone ever noticed yet about yuna's single-paired earrings tho
=
I hope new international Kpop fans can finally see what they missed when they didn't get into Kpop sooner. Also, glad AOA brought the much needed sexy concept back. Sexy concept is so dead in the recent years.
=
I keep coming back. I really hope they can win
=
AOA are still queens
=
So proud, i am not even their fans, but their performance just lit, its beyond my expectatation. After hiatus they still kill this stage....proud proud proud...i watched over and over....good job AOA 
=
3:05 is #me.
=
3:04 shuhua so cutee
=
LADIES ROCK th HOUSE
         as ALWAYS.....

=
I'm Seunghee all throughout this video
=
I never been more gay than this ever before. They truly fire. 
=
Sexy as hell!!!
=
*cough* 3:13 HOE
=
I'm all for Park Bom but I gotta say AOA brought the house down, their performance was on  
=
i just love that they're all gay panicking
=
the amount of times i've seen this perfomance ..... i don't think it is still healthy
=
 4:25 
=
OMG Seunghee's reaction is really cute, funny and I loved it. I only not see her reacting like that in this performance but also in Egotistic. You can see she's a big fan of AOA. ❤
=
i miss the so much
=
Who watched this like. 1million times? And nEVER GETS BOARD
=
I’m actually shaking omg.... this makes me miss the good days of kpop so bad. I LOVE YOU AOA!!!! THE PIONEERS OF KPOP THOTS!!!!!!!!! THIS WAS AN ABSOLUTE SERVE!!!!!!!!!!
=
They’re original sexy queens, even a woman can crush on them..their songs is 
=
AOAAAA SO GREAT I LIKE IT
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
Please tell me that I'm not the only one who feel emotional from watching this. This teared me up. I hope they'll regain their fame, they deserve it :""
=
I remember a few years ago I had a huge AOA phase and it was AOA content for days! I miss the other members but it's so great to watch the remaining members still perform. Chanmi is getting her moment! Yes! Shine through maknae!
=
3:04 Shuhua kyeopta
=
my queens
=
AOA won this first round.
=
Suddenly I want to be the floor.
=
Seunghee is such A MOOD
=
They deserve better at least 2nd
There stage persence is no joke
=
I keep re-watching this randomly ever since it was released. OBSESSED.
=
HAIL TO THE ACE OF ANGELS  !!!!!!!!! LOVE THEM FROM THE FIRST OT7
=
That girl from omgirl is such a mood haha
=
FNC please let them with this concept again  look everyone can die with this perfomance!!!!!  I miss this era so much.....
=
AOA, EXID, Hello Venus and SISTAR got me hooked more into kpop. Coz why not? Ahem! 
Wonder Girls and 2NE1 were amazing, but AOA's generation brought the sexy with class feel and the 'better' video quality. More entertaining to uhh, watch. Ahem. They (FNC and PLEDIS) kinda have the best 'dance practice' videos. Girl groups these days are more about 'cutesy cutesy' concept (LOL) and 'badass' concept. Some are okay, but by now I've had enough of those already. Groups like TWICE and IZONE, I feel, are just wasting the talents of Momo and Chaeyeon, who can be more badass coz all they do is act cute and pretend they are. TWICE music seem to be changing though, and IZONE has one more year as a group. I hope by next year, they'll have more age-appropriate songs/performances. With AOA and EXID, I hope they'll make a comeback. EXID always does well, but I hope AOA doesn't try TOO MUCH in being sexy or fitting in. I hope they'll get a song that's perfect for their next comeback.
=
i can't move on from this show
=
This is the sexiest concept I have ever seen
=
The best girls group ever!!!
I LOVE  YOU SOOOO MUCH☆
                        from Japan
=
7 years...but the best of aoa is yet to come. 
*I LOVE YOU SEOLHYUN* 
=
JUST WOW
=
Choa Left , still have Yuna 
Mina Left , Still Have Chanmi

If
Seolhyun Left , Idk what happen for AOA
=
雪炫luna太漂亮了吧！！！我啥时候能长那样
=
Jimin se tan delgada 
Me siento preocupada por ella
=
Sistar its gone, but we have aoa for sexy concepts (?)
=
Jiminnnnnnnn❤
=
Sexy, cute, and most importantly so fucking pretty and gorgeous. What's more? 



I miss ChoA and Mina damn much
=
honestly thought aoa was dead and disbanding but this show is everything 
=
Omg  what the fuck did i just watched now  this show is amazing and crazy  they were hot&sexy
=
Peoples who used to call AOA is dirty sexy I think now they miss this concept haha cuz literally no one can do sexy concept better than AOA it already legendary.
=
9 de octubre y todavía no puedo superar esto 
=
^ _ ^❤❤❤❤❤
=
I wish i was a chair
=
Aoa ver sexy
=
You can’t have an AOA performance without Jimin’s “hey”s 
=
Please remake song 'confused' with this 5 sexy member
#Elvis
=
Please go to streaming AOA sorry final performance
=
when they unzipped their zippers I think I suddenly became a man
=
They killed it!! Waiting for a come back
=
Sometimes they performed with 4 members somestimes ther perform with 5 member
=
1:57
=
This is lit  just lovely and sexy at the same time 
=
Aoa: let us teach u kids how to be sexy
Their hoobae idol: eonnie noooooooo
=
VGJunky you are so right.  Mature + Sexy is owned by AOA.
=
i miss them so much i want them back with sexy concpets like those :( btw wheres minaaaaaaa
=
i just realized. how the hell did a rap became fitting for a sexy song
=
This was a win for 2nd gen stans
=
OMG Seolhyun killed me TT_TT Chanmi had a solo dance omg i cried
=
Sexy!!!!
=
I'm going crazy. . . . . their voices are so sexy
=
I loveeeee my aoa
=
Imagine If Choa and Mina were here
=
AOA literally changed the world with this song... these are queens
=
If I didn't know I was Bisexual before, I would think I was now!<3 I seriously love verything about this song!
=
มงลงมากค่า แม่ก็คือแม่ และนี้และคือ aoa สุดยอด
=
0:45   1:25 Moonbyul we know you’re gay but your wife is beside you keep it minimum
=
They are doing this  in HEELS!queens
=
Did anyone else notice how Jimin almost tripped? 3:54
=
0:19
=
i am SHAKING
=
Man i miss aoa tho
=
Its time for kpop to bring this kind of sexy back. Watch and learn GGs! This is how you do sexy.
=
Slay yorobun ~
=
❤
=
Kerennnnn
=
I know this is irelevant but at 3:59 the guy was so hansome
=
Best AOA PERFORM EVER!!!! they dont show the energetic dance or complicated dance, they show " THIS IS A SEXY STYLE FROM ANGLE'S "
=
and yuna even lost her ring and she handle her performance flawlessly
=
they dont make groups like aoa anymore
=
gidleはみんな良いリアクションするなー
=
I can't speak, every shot is too beautiful, this is the mature charm of women, I love it!
=
6M~
=
To anyone reading this, their new MV is out!
=
Hwaaaaaaa
=
This angel's killing me❤️
=
oh i miss this sexy vibe
=
now see
this is the thing 
that makes my 
very gay heart
go *owo*
=
I was so scared for AOA’s downfall after choa and mina left but seeing them in queendom SLAYING AF AND ACTUALLY COMING BACK STRONG ASJSJSKSKJSJ I STANNED HARDER THAN BEFORE
=
QUEENS OF KPOP
=
Don't forget to stream Come see me on both FNC and 1theK channel !
=
Jimin the prettiest here
=
omg the whole performance i was unable breathe
=
We got sexy Hyejeong on the left, seductive Seolhyun on the right. Rap goddess Jimin, Yuna with the beautiful vocals. Chanmi killing us with the dance break. Literally I died. 
=
This performance felt like a powerful return for AOA. Like their iconic song Miniskirt was justified even more this time since the first time they released it!!! Although Choa isn't in the group anymore, she left a huge impact for AOA and the whole group itself too. True 'Elvis' (like myself!) had been supporting AOA for years even through their controversies and opinions that people had about them. Even when they were on hiatus legit I still listen to their songs to this day. AOA truly placed a mark on the kpop industry and is not credited enough for it.
 Keep supporting AOA!!!!
=
I’ve seen lots of kpop groups who do sexy concepts but when AOA does it, they always have this signature style of sexiness that’s why they are easy to recognize. Love them since 2014 (Miniskirt era) ❤️
=
I can't tell how many times I've watched this amazing performance!!!
=
OMG Jimin's HEY is just so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
It's like a MAMA performance!!
=
They're amazing. I miss the two members who left, I still hope they come back one day ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
=
seolhyun... ma'am...
=
2:49
=
My goodness. Sexiness Overload!
=
They are awesome
=
CHO A COME BACK TO AOA PLEASE
=
Seolhyun is a literal goddess. AOA lost their recognition thru the years. They deserve so much more!
=
Jungkook was mesmerized. Who wouldn't be.
=
Who is mixing AOA's original beats man?! they are crazy
=
I love shows like Queendom because it really shows the groups’ versatility. I’m falling in love with AOA 
=
AOA PLEASE DONT DISBAND ANYTIME SOON. I LOVE UR ELEGANT SEXY CONCEPT  It is become rare in kpop nowadays
=
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY AOA DON'T DO SEXY CONCEPTS ANYMORE, I MISS MINISKIRT AND LIKE A CAT ERAS DUH
=
That good
=
2:41
=
WHY YOU GUYS DID TO ME GERRLLL OH MY GOD!!!!
=
I hope they win the competition bcs This was Hot
=
PERFEITAS
=
I'm so happy that AOA is doing this! I thought they were done, But now hoping this revitalizes their Group and they do another comeback!! I think its so cool that the other groups are so supportive! I'm American and don't really understand what this program is all about? Just happy that AoA is doing this!!
=
TEN WORDS

SHIN JIMIN
SEO YUNA
SHIN HYEJEONG
KIM SEOLHYUN
KIM CHANMI
 Thank you for coming for my ted talk
=
After SISTAR, AOA is the next group that i know with sexy concept. Real queen. They deserve love, respect, and support.
=
I think AOA should've been higher ranked than Lovelyz.
=
Aoa Queens I'll never underestimate them again
=
Moonbyul is realy into it
=
aoa show us how sexy concept should be
=
mọi người  cho mình xin tên 3 thành viên còn lại đi, mình chỉ biết seolhyun với jimin. thích nhất chị hát mở đầu
=
Cambiaron arto 
=
miniskirt in 2019 hits differently
=
Who said Miniskirt is a trash?
=
0:58
=
Look, loved this soo much. You guys are true queens, I will forever support you guys, in your words "drop it" cuz y'all dropped it like it was hot and yes sir it was ✨
=
Sexy yet not Dirty 
Queen AOA
=
Seolhyun is probably the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever seen in my life
=
Definition of AOA = Sexy,elegant,high class
=
AOA is beautiful 
'
=
私はこれを何回見る気なんだw
=
Uowwwww
=
They should do a sexy comeback
=
Why do i keep watching this???
=
this is just too good
=
I miss choa
=
I swear there were 2 more members of aoa
=
Dije yo; que su tiempo de carrera aun puede continuar
=
3.26. Who is she? (Oh my girls) Left side
=
Why are all the girls backstage so taken aback in the beginning lol. This is the choreo since the beginning XD
=
WHUT DID I JUST WATCHED???? This is how SEXY SHOULD BE. They look expensive.
=
Maybe.. i'm not straight
=
MAMA performance we never had.
=
OMG i don`t know she cannnnn
=
This deserved higher than 4th place.
=
Please go to streaming AOA sorry final performance
=
Other group: *brings an army*
AOA: *whERE IS MY MINISKIRT AND CHAIRS*
=
seunghee is *SUCH A MOOD* omg this girl represents me so much *during this whole show* 
=
Oh my god.. No one can beat AOA when it comes to their sex appeal, dear GOD.
=
The skirt unzipping is AOA’s signature move.
DROP IT!!
=
AOA looks seductive and sophisticated at the same time. Their charismas’ no joke.
=
Who else can relate to everyone gaying over aoa at 1:25?
=
I remember back then, AOA and APINK were designed to rival SNSD... but SNSD was very much UNSTOPABLE at that point... but here in this performance, I see why... I didnt like them back then, cause they were so RACY for me at the time... but now, Im wondering why I didnt stan them then lol...
=
SEOLHYUN COULD REALLY PASS AS A BOND GIRL.
I CAN IMAGINE  HER AS THE LEADING LADY OF JAMES BOND!
=
So How the F*** AOA ranked 4th for this Fab performance?
=
this is what we called naturally sexy
=
Lovin' AOA. ❤️
=
Yes AOA yess!  Queens are back!
=
This remake is honestly a step up from the original! SO GOODDDDD I CAN"T STOP LISTENING TO IT HELP
=
#AOADESERVEACOMEBACK PERIOD.
=
First this and then egotistic, i'm falling for AOA charms 
=
0:46 Moonbyul is my gay soul
=
My inner gay just burst out!!
=
love it,,,
=
I really love this part 4:59
=
moonbyul at 00:46 is literally me everytime I watch this. aoa are so alluring it's impossible to not keep coming back to watch this ❤️
=
Older idol: awwwwww~~~
Younger idol: arrgghhhhh!!!!

Me: ah oh ah yesssss~~!!
=
i kind of love hate the difference between their two performances views. like i wish this had more, but seeing the hype around their other performance is so endearing bc aoa is being recognized more now instead of only for a killer sexy concept
=
that guy is me fr 3:58
=
Lmao Moonbyul is me
=
Wait can someone explain to me the premise of the show??? Cuz i love AOA so much holy but whats going on
=
As if this song couldn't get any better ... AOA you're killing me !!!
=
give them a fckin comeback im not a fan but idk ive been watching this nonstop like for real
=
Seolhyun visual is stunning
=
Where is mina ?
=
For me AOA should have gotten 1st in the 1st mission ~~
=
Hermosas
=
They never get old
Seolhyun got sexier
Jimin finally getting the attention she deserves
Chanmis dance moves amazing as ever
Yunas vocals
Hyejeongs visual
Though chao and mina left im still cheering for them
=
One of my fav aoa song
=
Woooo now i into girl group like thsi
=
Dude the first girl sounded like Britney Spears
=
I know that I am not the only one who’s coming back to watch aoa’s performance ❤️
=
Talento puro 
=
Everyone can try but no one can beat AOA when it comes to being sexy and classy performers
=
I C O N I C
=
Please go to streaming AOA sorry final performance
=
Please go to streaming AOA sorry final performance
=
i love AOA 
=
AAAAA KO BUNUH JELA AQUE SHIN JIMIN
=
Even though it's only 5 people, they really shine!!!
=
Wao ellas reynando como siempre son unos de los mejores grupos 
=
When it comes to sexiness, AOA can't go wrong.
=
AOA is so cool, they perform sexily but not dirty sexy
=
I religiously watch this every night.
=
I cried watching this. As an Elvis, I'm so proud of them.  Chanmi slayed her solo, and I loved every other moment. AOA drop it!
=
Seolhyun is one of the most beautiful and gorgeous women I have EVER seen WOW!!!
currently questioning my sexuality
=
I stan g-idle and mmo and not Aoa but. They deserve to win Queendom.
=
3:04 Shuhua HAHAHAHAHAHA
=
If AOA does not win this program I will be very upset. Legends without defects.
=
I sooo much love Chanmi and Hyejeong's tops ! 
By the way, not even surprised that they own the stage like the queens they've always been !
=
I don't know how I haven't seen this earlier. I thought it was over when Mina didn't renew her contract. AOA is my ultimate bias. I hope they decide to visit the US again.
=
Yuqi has all right "they're in another level"
=
I thought im ready to be gay all over them until 3:59 thanks for reminding me that im straight
=
I’m sure no one get bored with AoA they’re perfectly on sexy concept but not dirty and turn into elegant AoA you make me proud❣️
=
Where’s Mina? ):
=
Yes... This was an amazing performance. As expected from the queens
=
This make me miss old aoa (mina, choa) ,the first kpop girl group which I followed,QQ
=
My queens♥️♥️
=
That comment at 4:31 
=
THIS SCREAMS CLASSY IN ANOTHER LEVEL
=
They're just soo sexy 
=
if you're using an iPhone please kindly buy their cover song on iTunes. The sales & digital points (streaming, downloading using korean based sites: Melon, KakaoMusic, Bugs, Genie, Mnet, Naver Music, Olleh Music & Soribada) will be counted at the finale.
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT CHANCE FOR OUR GIRLS TO WIN.
SUPPORT AOA
=
THE BEST OF THE NIGHT!!
=
we need FANCAMS
=
I think many boy got their bone now.
=
WE NEED MORE !!!!!!!! AOA4LIFE
=
Ahhh i cannot choose between aoa n omg they are so hot!
=
I TEARED A LIL 
=
AOA I'm so Elvis
=
The gay panic was strong in this one...
=
❤❤❤❤
=
aoa is really something
=
1:26 them gays enjoying tho
=
girl groups being gay for aoa 5 minute straight
=
3:59 I thought ‘twas Jungkookiiee ❤️
=
I want to  be the chair > <
=
ชอบรีแอ๊คผู้ชายที่ 3.59 มาก5555 เราเป็นผู้หญิงยังมองตาค้างเลย สุดยอดมากก
=
Thats what we call A WOMAN group
=
Comback AoA
=
What is this show
=
sus reacciones son tan lésbicas las amo
=
Lol look at mamamoo just gaying over this sexiness hahahahaha
=
lets get to 6m
=
Omg yes!!! I love AOA!! Miniskirt was and will forever be one of my favourite songs and choreographies from them!! Of course this one has a few additions to the choreo that was in the music video, but it’s a great addition. It’s nice to see new people experiencing their performance. I really hope they get much more recognition.
=
Is there a no reaction version? Iol
=
I love you forever ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
5.5m :)
=
An amazing performance by AOA. They are bringing sexy back. Miniskirt is one of their best songs. 
=
Jimin looks like the little girl naeun
=
They don't make groups (or concepts) as sensual/sexy as they they did with 2nd gen girl groups anymore. No Sistar, Miss A, Girls Day, Stellar, Brown Eyed Girls, Secret, 4minute. I really miss my hoe anthems. LOL. AOA DEFINITELY deserved to get 1st place (I'm a Mamamoo/2ne1 stan). I hope they continue showing us their potential. I've really missed AOA and their music.
Not to mention that they came back and performed their BANNED CHOREOGRAPHY. Freaking bad asses, man. Hwaiting, AOA!
=
Honestly I thought that being only 5 from 7 would be bad, but they're still perfect, even more perfect than before.
=
Damn AOA didnt come to play. After a long hiatus they come out to show, how do you perform. Look at those views
=
They ain't my fave group but they deserve the first spot.
=
Where is Mina and ChoA?
=
I'm getting such a different vibe with AOA now, like their charisma and confidence ia showing and shining through in ways it hasn't before. I used to like their songs but not their stages, and now their stages something I look forward to. It's no longer Seolhyun and friends, it's AOA.
=
As much as I love all the other groups in this show, Aoa deserved the 1st place without doubt.
=
I’m a woman and I craved AOA so badly. This classy sexy concept, they are so god damn talented
=
I’d say 1M of the views is me i just come here automatically every time I open Youtube
=
You really can't underestimate AOA when it comes to sexy concept. I mean, there are other groups who can do sexy concept as well but AOA is just... Idk fam they are the founder of that concept and I love it.
=
AoA deserve to win this whole show
=
I'm not a fan of AOA.....but I've literally been watching this for like GOD KNOWS HOW MANY TIMES
=
Still slaying after 7 years.... I'm so proud of AOA
=
Start, Chanmi dance break and ending, everything was slay 
=
3:05 im shuhua 
=
Everyday I come here for AOA but now I also come to see Oh My Girl's reaction specially Seunghee she's so dorky <3. OMG they're so pure and innocent. Definetly I want to see Oh My Girl doing sexy concept with an AOA song.
=
It would be really really perfect with Choa
=
3:58 that guy is cute huhu
=
Speechless 
=
The other groups' reactions are just adding to the greatness that is AOA
=
The queens are here. I repeat, the queens are finally here!

=
I'm so happy to see them !!!! They look and sound phenomenal 
=
3:59
=
AOA  SLAYED IT
=
THIS PERFORMANCE HAD THE MOST HYPE FROM OTHER GROUPS UWU
=
AOA come back!!!!!!  Uwuuuuuuuu my fav girlgroup 
=
I actually love this performance the most but yooooo wtf is 4th place out of the 6 teams like really!?
=
QUEENS
=
AOA have been masters of a sexy but classy, glamorous performance, not dirty.
=
The power of a second generation girl group. This show is so lit 
=
OMGGGG
=
Who made Seolhyun that sexy? Who? 
=
you see, this is aoa. this is their identity. no one can ever top them at this rate.
=
Our queens are back. Without doubts, AOA is the best. They are sexy and elegant in a unique way. Wish can see their comeback soon.
=
Istg Im a girl but I'd turn gay for AOA anytime. Im glad ma girls are getting more recognition now
=
The other groups watching are so relatable. Like seriously their reactions are so similar to mine. It’s literally me dying watching this legendary song be brought to life.
Them:
“THIS IS NOT RIGHT”
“ISN’T THAT TO SEXY”
“THEY’RE ON ANOTHER LEVEL”
“NO NO NO”
=
May I remind u that they're wearing HIGH HEELS while dancing!!!
=
They're really on another level with this performance. They owned the stage in this round. AOA DESERVE MORE RECOGNITION!!
=
AOA I miss you all well done girls fighting God bless you 
=
I'll never go to sleep
=
I’M SO PROUD OF THEM
=
On fireeee
=
Moonbyul really out here representing my exact reaction to this performance 
=
WOAAAHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!  they actuallt killed this performance... this is my first time hearing AOA... i actually like this Girl Group... ive seen and watch other girl Group in Kpop.. but i think this Girl Group Got it... aside from MAMAMOO. SO SEXY , CLASSY , Beautiful and got the charisma and good personality... AOA need to make a comeback !
=
I suddenly want to see jungkook dance to this again.
=
We have to consider that they had to rearrange the song because choa and mina are not ther anymore. AOA did a great job. Love you girls 
=
Hey! Aoa! Brave sound drop it! Aaaaaaaaaaaahh chega a manteiga derrete.
=
omg, why am I getting emotional watching this ?? the vocal in the back track at 4:37 it’s Choa’s  they’ve gone thru so much but im fucking glad they’re getting their moment rn
=
These angels still have their spell on us 
=
AAAAAA NOMU JOAHE PLEASE MAKE THEY COMEBACK HHU
=
AOA✌
=
k-pop level is the most in the world……
wow,wow,wow.
I wanted to born Korean.
=
I'm scared they didn't let me breathe the whole time
=
MY GIRLS I MISSED THEM 
=
AoA... Low key slaying the whole damn thing!!!
=
Moonbyul, i see and understand u gurl kkkkkkk
=
they murdered the stage
=
Lmao Seunghee and Jiho being so excited and shook is honestly the best lol
=
Sexy and elegant, wow 
=
These shows are so iffffy to watch . How can one vote on another girl when they have totally different styles . I personally think all group are all good on their own without comparison.
=
MOST ICONIC PERFORMANCE EVERRRRRR
=
I can't stop watching this
=
They are all gay for aoa lmao
=
This song is legendary for me as i got into kpop on 2014
=
only 5 members now  but the nailed it GOOSEBUMPS!!! They deserved the top spot's.
=
Is the guy from 3:58 a trainee? He looks familiar to me. Anyone know his name? 'Cause Imma die finding it.
=
I've watched both performances from AOA with the reactions from other girl groups and I have to say this: "Is it just me who thinks this pretty lady @4:30 is their best reactor?  I don't even know her. Her comments are realistic but hilarious at the same time. Love it!
=
NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO! THE PRETTY GIRLS ARE? AOA! Ahaaa You know, I know 
=
There is no other KPOP group that knows how to make the concept sexy as AOA does.
AOA the best KPOP group !!! ❤❤
=
GOD. AOA AWESOME.....
=
2017
=
I can say, nobody tops AOA. this was so huge back then and this new performance just makes it even better omg. I love it so much. I could watch it repeatedly!!! Chanmi's parts are life. Love her voice!!! This is so sexy and makes me wanna scream while watching  Jimin's rap is gold ♥️
=
#AOA ❤️
=
Only thing missing some male to dance with very surprised how they were dancing sexy I thought  conservative country any no ideal who they are I love the other idols reactions 
=
Honestly im really glad the whole group  didnt disband despite losing so many members and they prove they can still sing their old songs and still sound good.
=
Sii !!
=
#aoa !! Las mejores !!
=
I don’t think they deserved 4th place at all. They must get the first rank compared to every performance.  It’s about the group popularity!
=
Let's streaaamm
=
Today there are empty groups with a sexy concept, perhaps AOA is the only group with this concept.
=
Las amo !
=
This feels so nostalgic. Listen to this when I was on 8th grade now I’m in college :) time flies but they still look stunning actually
=
I laughed when Shuhua tried to copy them  lol  I'm so sorry..
=
D E C E A S E D
=
Oooh so cool❤❤❤❤❤
=
CHANMI FINALLY GETTING THE SOLO STAGE AND RECOGNITION SHE DESERVES AS A MAIN DANCER
=
You know you miss them performing when you watch this everyday and it's still not enough
=
Compare this with Got7 versión lol 
=
I didn't think AOA would bring that much shock to the stage, but I was wrong because they were so great this time.
=
If you haven't watched their new cover performance of mamamoo's egotistic go there . AOA slayed that song ,too♥️
=
=
Aoa has a sexy concept not a girl crush concept, that's something I missed a lot about old K-pop cause nowadays all the newer girl groups have that girl crush concept which gets uninteresting after awhile. This is so refreshing and I'm so happy they are back and showcasing their iconic song after their long break.
=
Lyrics: "~I'm exhausted"
...
"But are you really?"
lololol
=
All AOA performances in this show were an statement and absolute beautiful. They didn’t settle down for nothing, they showed that they can wear whatever they want, from mini skirts to suit and tie, be sexy, sing, dance. They brought some diversity with the dragsqueens dancing with them. And everything in a perfect synchronized choreography
=
Here for AOA, stayed for OMG Seunghee’s reacts...the best
=
I can't with them I can't take the amount of perfection I'm 
=
I cant get over the beginning, "AOA DROP IT!!!"
=
Ohmygosh I missed them so much this was amazing I'm so proud ohmygod I'm cryinggg
=
I have to watch this everyday now
=
goshh i miss minah with her innocent face but still sexy af and fit with aoa very well
=
YOU, MY ANGELS WILL ALWAYS BE MY MOST FAVORITE GIRLGROUP!
=
I missed seeing the iconic part of the choreo where they unzip their skirts, this was the point part that fitted the song the most  AOA is so hardworking in this program and even doing it with 5 members. They deserve all the recognition they are gaining now
=
Watching this again for the nth time!
=
I cant move on to this version of mino skirt .
It takes my soul
=
I really love this version of Miniskirt...hope they release the studio version of this 
=
They deserved to be in Top 3 AT LEASET!!! AOA I'M ROOTING FOR YOU
=
omg i miss girls day,sistar and AOA second gen sexy girl group
=
missed them so much :< 
=
03:58 Ese no es familiar de Jungkook? :v 
=
I miss choa by watching this. Aoa ❤❤
=
They are still strong even though they're only 5 of them but still... what a superb performance!!! Brava!
=
Girls thank you so much for staying together. You're all very talented individuals. I hope that this is gonna be the start of your new beginnings. I'm proud of you girls.
=
AOA snatched all of the wigs
=
omg this vibe is so strange but i love it
=
AoA I missed them so much thanks to this program, they are real queens or better said, Angels
=
Omg i love them 
=
AOA is the definition of perfection, the definition of queens, the true loves of my life
=
They are so good.
=
Chanmi~!! Yuna!!! My precious Hyejeong...& Jimin~~
=
I cannot stop laughing when the girls screamed that cannot!! & not fair..... Good job AOA!!!!
=
The best Angels performance.....0:13
Luv it..... ♥️♥️♥️
=
I keep coming back
=
STUDIOVERSIONPLS
=
I really miss the queens
=
I've never been fan of Kpop gg but I've been hooked on these queendom performances and even tho I didn't knew any of these groups I can see that AOA are on another level. Wow!
=
Chanmi omg...stunning
=
Seunghee is me, when i watch it., LOL, they so Sexy but Elegant !!
=
i want T-ARA do this too TT
=
Confetti got into hyejeong eyes ;_; i hope it doesnt hurt for long
=
Every AOA performance got chills down my spine and I'm just ... I- IM SO AMAZED. They're so AMAZING.
=
It was the original choreo (not al all, just same vibes like a few years ago) but they're too surprised 
=
I lowkey am hoping clc would join this show
=
Yuna is GORGEOUS
=
Yeaaaah... AOA... I'LL SUPPORT YOU.. ALWAYS..
=
OMG  Hyejeong SLAAAY
=
Before: Cant imagine AOA without CHOA.
Looked at them now, still queens. 
=
IDK about you MNET but women supporting women is what we need right now. AOA KILLED IT 
=
My TOP 3 of queendom:
1) AOA
2) MAMAMOO 
3) GIDDLE
=
ChoA dejó un hueco muy grande , aunque han sabido lidiar con la ausencia de 2 miembros.
=
Please support and vote for them next week. Please make them happy after a long hiatus. T.T
=
Im scared o them for looking so fragile. Hope they get healthy weights back.
=
I watching this since last 3days. I never get bored. Who with me?
=
AS A FEMALE ELVIS!
I LOVE ALL THE FANGIRLS IN THE COMMENTS!!!
=
I'm here for Jimin's "HEY"
ICONIC AF
=
This is how AOA show their sexiness to their junior (except for bom since 2ne1 debuted in 2009)
=
“I’m getting exhausted”
“But are you really though?”
LMAOOO
=
这个看哭了，都是以前的回忆
=
PUT SOME RESPECT IN AOA’s NAME I’m a Sistar stan but they did that!
=
I can't believe they were 4th! A joke.
=
no one slays the sexy elegant concept in kpop other than AOA.
=
The producer: how awesome do you want your comeback to be?

AOA: Yes.
=
They did a great performance 
Like elegant sexy concept you know not vulgarity
They did elegant
=
cant believe they give this performance for free
=
AAHHHHHHHHHH THE DARK ANGELS SLAY AGAIN
srsly I love this song soooo much
And this show just brought it to a whole new level 
COOL AND SEXY FZKGXKXJDfzkz
=
This stage has Musical Chicago feeling.
=
I missed AOA. Huhu, welcome back queens!!
=
I came back here again 
=
Am i the only one like them being 5? It makes everyone stand out individually.
=
There is always a group who makes everyone gay haha
=
THIS IS A GIRGROUP BEING I-C-O-N-I-C.
=
they shine even with years after
=
i missed them SOOOO MUCH
=
4:48 lmao “THATS NOT FAIR!!”  Lolol
=
I never knew I missed AOA so much
=
1:26 im moonbyul
=
Bring back the "Confused" era pleasssssse‍♀️‍♀️
=
3:54 Jimin is struggling 
=
03:59 looks like jungkook?
=
OMG! Good job girls!
=
:Someone is missing

Yeah, 2 of them
=
5M views 
=
OMG’s reaction was priceless and hilarious at the same time, especially Seunghee’s. Never in my life I could relate so much to a person.
=
Reached 5m views 
=
AOA drop it!!!!
=
Great performance !
=
Now let's get 6M
=
damn angels
=
AOA difinitely killed it. The best performance.for me
=
They deserve more 
4th rank is not enough :"(
=
ชอบ ชอบมากๆๆฮือออออ  AOA ❤
=
3:04 
=
I can't stop watche this 
=
Oh My Girl reaction is like AOA small fan girls~
=
Wah Really nice dancing
=
After watching episode 4, I’m not ready for next week y’all. Apparently they’re having sub-units with members from every group 
=
THEY'RE SO TALENTED AND HOT
=
แปลเม้นไม่ออก
=
even only 5 member , their perfomance make me surprise a lot
=
I've been a fan since Elvis era and this is truly one of their best performance EVER.
=
In my opinion, they didn't win because people voted for their favourite group instead of performance. This was seriously the best one...
=
AOA sexiness are on next level. So effortless yet so sexy
=
Welcome to another episode of: 

"Why AOA is so sexy?"
=
*”Isn’t this a bit too sexy?!”*
Welcome to AOA
=
How did  they get only 4th place in this performance they deserved so much more
=
2nd gen girl groups, what a time to be alive
=
The whole Oh My Girl backstage watching this issa mood
=
This just made me cry yet I’m still so happy for them! I miss the old AOA and I’ll never stop supporting this generation of AOA!
=
NO OTHER GIRL GROUP THESE DAYS HAVE THAT ELEGANT SEXY AOA STYLE NO ONE CAN DO IT LIKE AOA PERIODT
=
In this show i love AOA MOST. They are talented and hard working.
=
still can't believe that this performance is just in 4th place
=
They should have been ranked 1st for this. It was amazing. Good job!
=
i watched more than five times and still getting chills on this amazing performance.
=
girl group members in this show gives the wholesomeST reaction 
=
Omg I can’t help but remember how BTS danced to this 
=
Yesss Yuqi baby AOA is on another level 
=
watching this only made me miss choa more like her vocals were just perfect for aoa 
=
I need this version on Spotify the Spanish tune to it it’s soooooo captivating❤️❤️❤️ I FREAKING LOVE AOA
=
Seolhyun is really really beautiful 
=
Oh My Girl reactions . I love them so much. AOA deserves to win.
=
oh my gosh!!!! hotness overload!!!
=
Is it me, or I didn’t feel like anything was missing even if Choa and the other girl (sorry, don’t know her name) left? I’ve seen AOA even way back, and this setup for me is even better. Chanmi now gets a spotlight instead of being put in the back. Still don’t know the names of the 2 vocalists but they carry the group perfectly fine even without Choa.
=
3:59 is that Lee Eunsang?
=
Damn even after two members leaving Chanmi barely get extra line
=
I am so addicted to this . AOA drop it
=
Byul ah. Control your excitement please 
=
after watching this performance, i was found DEAD in a ditch and my wig snatched
=
I miss this!!!
=
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGV WTFFFFF AOA
=
I'm really annoyed with this show showing us the reaction of other groups. I want to enjoy the performance without disturbance damn it
=
THIS IS MINISKIRT AT ITS FINEST!!!!!!
=
This show is lit, I don't care anymore. It brings the golden memories back.
=
Let's stream to 5M
=
I love them so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️ and I’m so proud of what they’ve become today!!!! They are slaying the sexy concepts and they still to this day SLAY EVERY performance‼️‼️❤️❤️
=
i watch this a milion times whats wrong with me
=
their outfit woah
=
my Jimin
=
Why was i thinking about got7’s cover of this the whole video 
=
❤❤❤❤❤
=
Im gay for seolhyun
=
choaaaAa I miss u
=
Ha! I love it, "isn't too sexy"? No it's never too sexy, especially when it comes to AOA! 
=
AoA is so 
=
=
I love girl crush style but I still wish there will be more sexy girl groups like GSD and AOA ><
=
Why did I think it said AQA (MK PEEPS)
=
Bruh wth this was sexy already wjdbekdbdn
=
Seolhyun is sexy no matter what
=
WAIT TILL AOA SING LIKE A CAT ON THIS SHOW WITH ANOTHER CHOREO AND U GUYS WILL DIE PEACEFULLY.  ... And secretly hoping Choa coming to sing her part and comeback from her hiatus just to help her fellow members.
=
Notice how they didn't show the male audiences reaction lmao I mean even the girls went crazy backstage
=
Lmfaoooo the people reacting are funny asf
=
I ugly cried because I wanted AOA to do so well after going through line up changes and hearing that Jimin lost so much weight from stress  my queens
=
AOA just shook Oh my girl. Their reaction was the same as mine. No one can handle AoA going full sexy no one.
=
=
If 9 muses,spica,stellar,hello venus, girls day,exid,rainbow is still active they would probably join. So sad. Lets protect aoa at all cost
=
nowadays girl groups only do badass,girl crush, and cute concept I really miss this kind of concept. (No hate though)
=
Hyejung is so beautiful
=
Choa must be missed all of her girls
=
Just can't understand how they can lose after this
=
Still can't believe that they only got a 4th position for this
=
"isn't that too sexy?" 
NO. That's how you do it.
=
IN EVERY SINGLE GROUP HERE, WHY THIS SHOW CONTINUES TO QUESTION MY SEXUALITY???
=
Moonbyul's gay reaction when AOA started unzipping their skirts, such a Daddy
=
Happy to hear Seolhyun's vocals shine. They're all goddesses ❤
=
i've been loving aoa since my junior highschool days. now i really respect them. they are the real definition of grown up womens. thanks for stay together. we love u aoa <3
=
3:05 HAHAHAH SHUHUA SO CUTE
=
Like heechul say, AOA is his rivals ,,, all is pretty!!!! Goddess 
=
1:23 my heart 
=
Honestly liked this performance better than Egotistic :o so iconic
I think for this round, Mamamoo and AOA’s score should swap.
=
the first malijima before itzy yeji's omg
=
IM CRAVING FOR SEXY CONCEPT LIKE AOA DID IN KPOP INDUSTRY PLS IM BEGGING
=
That *AOA DROP IT* OF JIMIN ALWAYS GET ME 
=
damn aoa just murdered my faves on television
=
I can worship SeolhyunHyejeongChanmiYunaJimin Z I M I N at this rate. Gahd why im so late!
=
aoa teaching young gen of kpop of what being sexy is
=
I AM DESEASED
=
I love this out of all performfances and 4th place?
This kind of concept and vibe only make me k pop fan
cute concepts are not my type
=
When choa part came and u can still hear her voice at 4:39, my hearteu . But this new AOA vibe is sooo classy
=
I love contemplating my sexuality! 
=
i need the clean audio version of this!! 
=
Choa must be really proud of them
=
I love how this show helps bring to light the underrepresented kpop GGs. People are finally starting to acknowledge them
=
Harus bgt nonton ini berulang ulang tanpa berenti "wow" !!!(๑♡∀♡๑)
=
This is it. Im stanning AOA! Imma follow fansitenim...
=
How the fudge are all their legs so ON POINT
=
menangos aku melihat ini T__________T the gud old days <////3
=
Jimin jjang
Yuna jjang
Hyejeong jjang
Seolhyun jjang
Chanmi jjang
AOA Fighting
=
They are expert on stage! Wow
=
AOA is the best gg omg QUEENS OF KPOP INDEED
=
3:59 this fanboy so eye-catcher. He's cute
=
AOA freaking slayed...
=
Las diosas.!!!! <3
=
❤️
=
I'm neverland but they deserve to be on top❤️
=
this is hot
=
I don't know them individually coz i'm just their casual watcher but AOA screams talent!
=
I wish this video can reach 3M views before the next episode of Queendom !
=
you know shit about to get real when Jimin said “AOA drop it” instead of “hey” as their intro.
=
7th year in kpop industry, with a lot of controversy and scandal yet they show that they're still worth it! 
=
There three types of fan ;
1 - OH MY GIRLS (innocent supportive loud fangirl)
2 - G-IDLE (keep praising and wow-ed by AOA)
3 - MAMAMOO (cant keep their eyes on AOA)
=
You can really tell based on the reaction of the other groups or contestants that AOA really was the winner. If it's not only based on votes, AOA would have won.
=
You know AOA is really the epitome of sexiness. They don't look cheap aff. Love this girls sooo much. 
=
FNC this is your legendary girl group
=
This show is everything !! At this point I don't even care who's the winner anymore I'm satisfied either ways
=
AOA for the win❤️
Vote them
They deserve more than 4th place
=
Bring back sexy concepts! We’re tired of girlcrush and cute girlgroups
=
Hope to see cherry bullet here next year 
=
Son tablas pero sensuales 
=
Omg
=
I’m an exol and reveluv but I’ve liked AOA since their Like a Cat days and after watching queendom I declare I have fallen in love with them I MIGHT JUST HAVE TO STAN
=
玩性感三代团完胜啊
=
When this show on tv or YouTube live????
=
Dropped it
=
When nuke hits
=
2:40
=
FNC what now? Are you having them make a comeback this year or what? Do it right this time 
=
I think I'm a lesbian now... they are so incredible!
=
I didn't know this song could become even sexier than before!
=
man I love everyone's reactions lol they're so relatable
=
Anyone notice that at 3:04 Shuhua copy AOA and it so funny
=
This is AOA' s revival! 2 members are gone (including the main vocal) but they seriously still got it! They need a comeback asap!
=
the way these girls are hyping each other up
=
The best of ma heart
=
AOA WE LOVE YOU❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
I literally couldnt take it anymore when chanmi came in with her beautiful dance, I really missed her dances as a main dancer GET IT GURL AND AOA ILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU
=
This girls is on fire 
=
I really love this concept, love the member with this version (sorry) 
=
They just brought me back my lost elvis soul
=
I really miss choa seeing them perform this make me miss choa so much
=
This is called Queendom, territory of a queen. I became their fan
=
They really are the best in this show
=
They aren’t AOA who i know 
=
Seriously this is deserve at least number 1/2 :(
=
Aoa keeps slaying Queendom!
=
Maknae killed it
=
Hoobae reaction is priceless. Go aoa
=
Okay now i need to know all the members name, i only know jimin and seolhyun
=
Damn i miss choa
=
my ot7 feels screaming
=
Im so missing you Choa
=
Queens 
=
Y’all I don’t stan oh my girl but this one girl that hypes everyone up and is the biggest fangirl.. I LOVE HER AND HER ENERGY
=
Really, Seolhyun so pretty, that's black hair just another level
=
hyejeong seolhyun VISUALS
=
wuwuwu.，好棒 AOA撒拉黑
=
High key slay, no one can pull off this concept like AOA and damn this revamp is soooooooo goooodddd 
=
how did jimin pull off any hairstyle
=
well i love all the other girl groups in this competition but seeing park bom and aoa's performance gives me nostalgic feelings and brings me back to that *kpop feeling i knew* . KUDOS TO THIS STRONG GIRLS EVEN IF THEY'RE JUST FIVE NOW. LUV YOU AOA!
=
Glad to see that jimin is now ok
=
ohH they have them tapes on shoes
=
I'm a dude but AOA make me "Lesbian"
=
Yuna did so well deeabaaak
=
how is this performance fourth place?
=
Even though I prefer their Egotistic performance and not really into this sexy style, I have to admit they so professional with years of experience performing this style, very well done.
=
Ace of Angel of course..
=
คิดถึงโชอาถ้ามีครบ7คนจะขนาดไหนนะ
=
Choa...
=
Yesss, everyone stop sleeping on AOA. And also yes to Chanmi getting that spotlight. My girl deserves all the love.
=
AOA IS AMAZING ! But why got7 dancing to miniskirt's image keep coming up my mind .....
=
I'm a hardcore MAMAMOO fan but I would like AOA to win Queendom because these girls deserve to have that amazing comeback prize from this show after everything that they've been through as a group.
=
LMAO AND YOU'RE TELLING ME MNET/QUEENDOM ISN'T RIGGED FOR PUTTING THEM IN 4TH PLACE???
=
YUNA NATION’S VOCALIST, CHANMI NATION’S DANCER, HYEJEONG NATION’S VISUAL, SEOLHYUN NATION’S IT GIRL, JIMIN NATION’S RAPPER
=
they're not a girl group anymore, they are a WOMEN GROUP HOLY SH!T MAN THE POWER THE OOZED THROUGH THE SCREEN, how did the audience survived??
=
INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE
=
The only girl group that makes me question my sexuality
=
AOA MAKES ME GAY
=
when some gen3 gg's fans were explaining how hard to dance on highheels, AOA made it easily without mistake
=
Damn, not only is this a fresh remix, like really? Latin miniskirt? ILLEGAL. They also performed SO well. They are pros, and if anyone was doubting them and thinking that they don't got it anymore I hope they can see how wrong that was
=
*ohmygod*
=
Seolhyun is to pretty, omg. Is she real human???
=
CHANMI!!!!!! OMIGOD
=
I mean.... Lets be honest mamamoo did lack energy where aoa were there killing...... I think aoa deserved better position

=
who is here after watching sorry?
=
The time when you realise that you are actually gay ....
=
The pioneers of 3rd Gen Kpop Girl Groups
=
Touched to cry
=
They did such captivating performance but im still curious, what happened to their other members?? Where have they been?
=
if Choa is here this will be a freaking hot stage performance like girl I’m gonna die
=
I don't care if they didn't win, this is one of the best performances I ever saw
=
I don't care about rank this is the best performance in Queendom
=
You all can't disagree when I say that this performance got everybody to watch queendom
=
Jimin's iconic line: "I'm the tree." ♡
=
Anyone else freaking out the Seolhyun has a lot of lines and you can finally hear her vocals?!? :DDDD
=
AM I WATCHING MAMA'S PERFORMANCE OR SOMETHING!? THIS IS SO LITTTT
=
Egotistic + AOA + Jimin’s rap + drag queens = the best performance ever
=
This show to all haters that AOA not just about sexiness. They are talented singer and dancer (plus jimin a great rapper) Proud
=
Whoever created this concept, deserves double thumbs up
=
I'm not sure if this is just me, but after watching this performance multiple times I couldn't help but cry out of joy. AOA has been through a lot for the past few years (scandals, members leaving, personal issues and etc.) and seeing them perform this grand, which was above my expectations, just shows that AOA is not a force to be reckoned with. I just hope that SK and FNC don't sleep on them, otherwise they won't know whay they're missing. #AceOfAngels #AOA #ElvisForever
=
Anyone knows the featured dancers info? They slayed!
=
I can not stop watching this seriously like this the 10000000 times and counting time I have watched this like this IS GOLDEN LIKE OMG I LOVE THIS !!!!!!
=
after watching this so many times, i need to give my opinion:
Daaamn jimin what a way to start the song ! and that rap line, so meaningful ! Even tough she sounds so different from what a person usually expect from a rapper, she's so good and knows how to use her voice very well !
Seoulhyun husky voice wooo so charm her voice fits so well to this song, i mean, is impossible replace that part with other voice ! she's showing that she's not only a pretty face but also a great singer !
Dong Dong... goshh once she's on stage she kills everyone ! love her voice, i'd love to listen to her doing some covers or something like Yuna in her Channel.
Yuna... the peaceful one who is always doing her best ! incredible voice ! Once i listened to her voice i fall for her instantly hahaha
and last but not least important member, Chanmi... really her rap part and her growl is killing me every single time hahaha she's showing she's not just a dancer but a RAPPER ! trully love her rap and singing parts ! and her part was so girl crush daamn ! 
Also props and credits to the dancers, they did it very well and I love how AOA give them their time to shine ! Also love the fact their dancers were not just an addition, they were an essential part of this presentation ! 
love how every member was jamming the entire show, that's so great !
=
To everyone watching this, please check AOA new comeback, *come see me* they need all of your support
=
When I saw this episode I was really nervous how they were gonna pull off this song as their vocals are much different from Mamaoo. They did a wonderful job with the song
=
the fact that this got them at the bottom 3 was so shocking... like??? how???
=
For those who haven’t watched Queendom - this is what one of the members said that got me really sad and sentimental
When Hyejeong said,
“I want to act. I want to be on stage. I want to interact with the fans. I want to still do this and that’s why I am still in FNC” (her company)
=
Whatever the ranking is, this is still the best performance out of all Queendom performance. AOA takes the crown for this one.
=
This performance is still my most favorite performance in like .... EVER. Honestly, covering a mamamoo song is hard but making it your own is downright impossible and they did *THAT* !!! Now every time I feel like watching an Egotistic performance I literally come here first. With they’d re-image to this because damn they’d be unstoppably powerful.
=
THIS IS TRULY ... QUEENDOM!!!
=
This performance is such a big statement for Korea. 
This show is a statement! Women are powerful!
=
No doubt this is the LEGEND!
The New Egotistic just become like AOA's own song.
=
Who say they gotta show off some skin to be sensual AF!! This literally called their haters dumbasses haha go off queens
=
I thought Choa was cry when she watching her family on the stage
=
Can't imagine if Choa still in this group. Will be more lit!!!
=
_" I don't want to be a flower, I'm the tree "_ 
-Jimin 2k19
=
They don't need to be on some sexy outfits. They will still slay like this!!
=
Seolhyun's voice is so pretty
=
This was the best performance. People have to know that having highest note or best dance doesn’t mean that performance is the best. It’s all about how you you deliver it, as a group. AOA was bop
=
This is by far one of the most memorable performance queendom and the best cover of egotistic. Way to go AOA and I'm here for ur comeback
=
I wish this was their song. It feels so clicked in a good way
=
Are we all just gonna act like Jimin did not EAT and BODY her rap
=
I love mamamoo i love the original version
But damn this version shook me
Hands up
=
It’s been two months and I can’t stop listening to this cover
=
Hands down should've won. One of the best stages of the entire series.
=
still listening 
=
I hope their company takes advantage of the attention they’ve gained and of the new fans they’ve hopefully gained after these amazing performances by giving them consistent comebacks and good promotions. They could reach their prime again easily if they were just helped.
=
They already won with this performance .forget the final ahaha
=
they won this stage in my heart. hell, they won the whole comp in my heart
=
I love how AOA gave the spotlight to their dancers ☺️
=
Egotistic by Mamamoo:  sexy and strong
Egotistic by AOA : classy and softy
=
BEST PERFORMANCE FOR ME 
=
Don’t come @ me but i like this version waaaay better than the original
=
This.... Will.... Remain.... Legendary!!
=
MY ANGELSSS ❤️
=
*idc about the rankings and all but THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BESTEST PERFORMANCE IN THE WHOLE QUEENDOM*
=
Jimin's rap is what im urging for
=
Jimin is THE TREExdxd
=
I went to South Korea this fall and I heard in a shop the egotistic music, and it was the AOA version
So proud ❤️
=
AOA letting everyone know they are still together as a group and hungry.
=
I personally like their version of egotistic, they nailed it. Its just a pity their did not win this round.
=
the best perfromance in the Queendom
=
When you see AOA comeback with 5 group members 1:36
=
3:23 Anyone else got goosebumps when they sang Bicho Malo? Jimins voice tho damnnnn
=
I love Mamamoo but damn this version sounded even better than the original wow
=
I don't care who wins now, Queendom is literally showing fans that they are all idols with impeccable talents.
=
This is so good.. OMG.
The only mystery that I still don't understand is why G IDLE got 6th rank LoL
=
Moonbyul: is that really our song?
Me: *hello* u added 2 new rap verse in goodluck. What do u expect Aoa to comment back?
=
My fav cover  
I still got goosebumps even after watching more than 5times
=
Coolest perfomance wow
=
I've actually never heard the original Egotistic by Mamamoo. This song suits AOA so well that I'd assume it was theirs to begin with 
=
Sin duda el mejor performance. ✌ #AoA #TheQueens  Las amoooo
=
We dont need a kingdom, we wanna queendom2 Do you hear me mnet?!
=
On Queendom, AOA’s performance have probably been my favourites. They deserve so much.
=
1:40 QUE GURI LINDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  
*1:40** WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BOY*
=
I always crying when watching their performance. i don't know why?? AOA really talented girl group . I think AOA one of the best Group in queendom

I love Jimin voice
=
One of the most iconic stages ever 
=
Shin Ji-min's attitude is what got me to stan them, girl got flow~
=
I’m still into it until now.
AOA
=
In Korea that is not open to LGBT matters, I think this stage is so amazing.
=
Hello everyone watching this especially those who're watching for the nth time. Their sixth mini album titled new moon is up for preorder right now from usual sellers (ktown4u, yesasia, etc).
Please support ‍♀️
Thank you.
=
I love both aoa and mamamoo then this came I'm like:
┻━┻ ︵ヽ(‘Д’)ﾉ︵ ┻━┻
"SHOW 'EM QUEENS!"
=
I live for the fact all the straight males in the audience immediately felt personally attacked once the dancers came out LOL. Look at theses cis straight males not liking their bodies being exposed and used as eye candy when the tables are turned. YAS KWEENS SHOW THEM!!!!
=
I KEEP ON COMING HERE hahaha... okay done expressing myself... I really love them, and this version so muchhh... tho I admire also the original ver. 
=
Jimin is the cutest rapper I've ever seen uwu
=
Yesss 15M! ❤️
=
Queendom my fav 10 Stages
1. AOA - Egoistic 
2. Six Puzzle - Power
3. OMG -  Guerilla
4. AOA - Miniskirt
5. (G)-idle -  Say no / Put it Straight
6. AOA - Sorry
7. (G)-idle - LION
8. Mamamoo - Destiny

=
For me it’s really great show
=
I should say this is the most impactful performance of queendom. 
=
Please support AOA comeback-Come see me 
=
AMAZING. Those Drag Queens. That genderfluid aesthetic. Nothing but respect for AOA.
=
They always QUEEN for me
=
this performance gives me goosebumps every time that I see it
=
Omg this how amazing performance
=
Props to them for doing this. This is Queen level stuff
=
Elvis! Let's support AOA's comeback "Come See Me" ❤️
=
Wow, came across this performance after watching Seolhyun in My Country: The New Age. Searched her on YouTube and here i am commenting on her. Seolhyun is just amazing and beautiful. All the best. From England!
=
1:36 she is me now :v
=
SEND MESSAGE TO MNET :     *Hope a Queendom 2 with so amazing perform like this (and "destiny"....)*
=
HOW DID THEY NOT WIN???
THEY'RE LEGENDS PERFORMING IN THE KPOP INDUSTRY ! PEOPLE SHOULD'VE NOTICED THAT BY NOW. IT'S 7 YEARS.
=
The best performance ever :)
=
aawww man i love MMM's original Egotistic, but AOA legit made it their own and turn it into this expensive and classy sound that's amazing aahh!!
=
歌唱力とかダンスを本家と比べると〜
と言う方もいらっしゃいますが
それよりなによりパフォーマンスとして
最高級だと思います✨✨
=
Who's the rapper?? I think I've just fallen in love
=
They’re da best.I really like them.Aoa
=
Moonbyul the whole time: 
=
ジミン姉ちゃん大好き
=
"CD DVD TV." 
I been having LSS to that part. 
=
1:46 Byul's reaction to Jimin covering her was like "you did it, girl!" bias with bias! 
=
I can't get over this performance, it was perfect!
=
i keep comin back here
=
Top Three best rapper of this generation on one show... That's a wow... I wanted it... Wow
Soyeon, Moonbyul, Jimin,.... 
=
I love this stage!!! I can't remember how many times I have watched it...Because this stage is so awesome that I want to watch again and again...
=
What I truly like about them is their personalities, their humour alongside humility. Just love every on stage and off stage scene.
=
Admit it that this is the most jaw dropping performance of Queendom
=
I love Mamamoo with all my heart, they are one my of favorite girl groups, but when it comes to Queendom, AoA slayed every single perfomance they had on this show and were by far the more consistent and outstanding run. This is still the best performance on Queendom from all performers.
They may not win the show, but they certainly win many fans, myself included.
=
I absolutely love this cover, the performance was amazing. I love both AOA and Mamamoo and Egotistic is my 2nd favourite Mamamoo song after Aze Gag. The way Jimin raps "cd, dvd, tv" makes me smile everytime and I can't imagine a better person to cover Byul's rap either :D Also, I always appreciate how good my bias Seolhyun looks in a suit ;)
=
Btw can we talk about how amazing Jimin raps??!! I've never seen such powerful Queens!!! They're THE BEST KPOP GIRL EVER in the industry trust me. No one can beat these girls !!!
=
1:36 honestly me
=
youve should see Jimmin back in a days...when she was competing on UNPRETTY RAPSTAR, way back in 2015...when she competing against Cheetah, Cheetah and Jolly V said, "Jimmin looks like a psychopath!" shes attacking you with a strongest swear words ever said, and saying "eat this shit!" while shes smiling!...and i still remember what she said before, "im the leader of AOA, im the best rapper that FNC's have, me and my crew going to break, through everyone who tries to brings us down!" what just happen now?...God, i want to see that Jimmin which is no fear to anyone...the Jimmin who slays anyone who comes on her way, way back then...
=
I can't stop play this, love it
=
14 million views!!!! im Shookt!!! this is the only lit performance for me among the Queendom performance!!!
=
1:36 what a reaction
=
I'm a total moo moo but aoa stole mamamoos song as their own.  they were like "swoosh"
=
Imagine choa perform this song with them :’)))))
=
This is still my favourite!!! Shoutout to all the dancers too!!! 
=
Wish we could the camera to focus on the performance and not on other’s reactions.
=
This is how you do a cover!! ❤️
=
Probably the best performance across all rounds.
=
Why tf am I crying this actually touched me more than it hyped me up
=
After seeing this I feel in love with AOA❤️
=
OMG yes they are so amazing and I love what they did on stage that was so cool !
=
OH MY GOD THIS IS SO GOOD WTHH
=
SEOLHYUN'S VOICE OMG
=
1:35 me the whole song
=
Aoa got robbed, they should have won first place
=
Jimin's rap at the start goes so hard. Amazing!!
=
Hyejeong's voice 
=
"I'm the tree" - Jimin 2019
=
Juat came back to watch again for the nth time .... still get chills...it hasn't lost its impact over all this time.  Still iconic.
=
Mv Project for AOA "Come See Me" 3M in 24Hours
Please help us to make this comes true
=
This song was made for them 
=
I’m happy that I can see all of them are having a good time in this stage❤️
=
i keep coming to this clip..this is so addictive haha
=
Aoa in suit is my sexuality  
Plus women in suits are superior
POINT. BLANK. PERIODT!
=
New fan now. Wow. On repeat
=
This shows that these queens will be back as a new amazing group
=
Then i realize that seohyun voice's is unique and lil bit husky. They all captivating, stage performance so gooddd...no wonder they still together til now.
=
I can’t stop watching this and YooA’s smooth criminal...
=
1:46 Hey Mnet, Your camera crew messed up and zoomed too much as usual. Now we missed what looks like a sweet choreo. Congrats on ruining art
=
Best performance of Queendom
=
Just one word, ICONIC 
=
Boms "oh"
=
OMG, I love this, this one is AMAZING! I mad I didn't know about this before but it makes me happy seeing them perform like that, AOA still (more than) good.
=
This makes my heart break and full at the same time. There’s so much more to AOA than the sexy dances and high pitch voices. They’re awesome af. If only they’ll be given great songs that would do their talents justice. This is one of my fave performances. Love you AOA.
=
Thank you, AOA, for giving the gays everything they want!!!! <3
=
1:36 me everytime i wacth these kind of videos
=
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ~~~~ I REALLY CANT STOP LISTENING THIS <3 !!!
=

=
This superb best performance of AOA the sing talent skill really improve, every member now each have influential to song, damn why fnc dont make make AOA song like this before
=
Bicho malo 
=

For those who can't get over this performance, then please, str3@m *COME SEE ME*
=
Introduced to (g) idle and realised that aoa is still in the industry thanks to this show, since it has been years I stopped from listening to kpop songs. They should give aoa better songs for them to shine again just like good old days  one of the best performances in queendom
=
First girl Rap is the best <3
=
The power of AOA ❤
=
Seunghee reaction Very Iconic 
=
This is still one of the best performance.  I dont know but their aura has so much something one of a kind
=
That performance  
 but Whos that guy at 1:41 
=
i love their vocal color so freaking much
=
I know this group as a girl group with full of visual and sexy  But now they slay with full of charms and so charismatic.. I glad they come back
=
CHanmi is so underrated, she is a good vocalist, rapper, dancer and actress <3
=
that bird perspective of the dancers arriving ended heteronormativity
=
I'm sad I only saw this now.
=
Seolhyun is amazing in every way possible :
Singing/ dancing/ visuals/funny .....
She juste said : DADDY ENERGY BOUME
=
so nobody is gonna talk about Yuqi face at 1:35 ?
=
Seolhyun's voice is just sweet with crunch
=
I don't even Stan AOA but 1:36 was me the whole time
=
Seolhyun voice at 0:39 
=
my gei blood is increasing 
=
Is it okay if I prefer their version than the original?
=
This one is my favourite...good that they pushed the boundary a little...kudos to that!!
=
The male dancers look so happy and enjoying the dance tho  Really really like this cover 
=
I LOVE everything about this stage. It's perfect
=
Aoa and Oh My Girl owned Queendom no arguement. All the other groups had their highlights but Aoa and OMG took it bruh no cap. I mean I love the other groups but like no not this time
=
I can watch this thousand times and still want watch it again
=
1:36 just go there for the best thing ever xd
=

Yuqi, my dear, your face is priceless 
=
Stills the best stage ever in Queendom, such an iconic performance. I'm so proud to be an Elvis 
=
3:52 this man is incredible . uou
=

=
This one my favorite.

FNC please let AOA have this kind of cb next time, this really suit them, come see me one step to this concept but this song is on another level
=
I just discovered AOA and they’re pretty good 
=
WELCOME NEW ELVISSSS. We stan ACE OF ANGELS together!

=
aoa dancing with drags queens, iconic moment
=
Uau, Brasil here <3
=
Performance paling terngiang sejak nonton queendom, ini yg terbaik sihhh 
=
 
If girl groups sing MAMAMOO's songs, it really brings out their vocal performance well. I've never heard AOA sound as good as this ever. My perspective has totally changed about them. They could sing! They put originality into this cover plus used their real vocals and it was the bonb!!!     
Keep it up ladies!
=
Aoa was robbed PERIOD!
=
This episode is jjang!
=
The best cover ...
=
1:35 
=
please don’t feel like its too late to start stanning them!! this is AOA they’ve been in the industry for 7 years and are still showing that they have it
=
hyejeong  ❤
=
I think i like Jimin.
=

=
AOA fighting！
#AOA #ComeSeeMe

Bingle watching all Queendom AOA performances... and it feels sooooo good ! ❤

=
1:36 its like WTF
=
Go" i'm the tree " - JIMIN
20M VIEW!!!
=

=

=

=
Can't get over it
=
THIS PERFORMANCE MADE MY EYE OPEN. YOU DON'T NEED TO PERFECT A PERFORMANCE> JUST HAVE FUN!
=
iconic performance in kpop history..
=
Even tho they didn’t win, this is still my fav stage
=
Sure AOA didn’t win but 13 Million organic views? Just shows how underrated and under appreciated they are
=
Bring this performance and OMG's Destiny to MAMA 2019 pls Mnet
=
One of the legendary stage in Queendom!
=
Queendom just stated that this specific performance was the most popular in Queendom. Wow, the views are just increasing like crazy 
=
13M Views 351K likes and 41K comments, we did it, now let's go to 14M and don't forget to streaming AOA sorry final performance too
=
jimin the Queen
=
i can't count how many times i've replayed this performance. i was one of those people who said AOA was done after Choa left bc i only liked her vocal abilities but... omg this is a rediscovery of these girls' talents. it's so refreshing to see them covered up and showcasing their true abilities. all of them are SO talented. i'm sorry i couldn't see beyond your sexual appeals. love you girls 
=
this is the best performance from queendom 
=
They really should rank higher this week only if they received more votes so sad
=
that's it I decided to stan. This by far is my favorite performance in the show
=
1:35 YUQI‘S FACE IS SENDING ME HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH
=
I still listen to this even after a month 
=
Best performance of queendom
=
falling for seolhyun's voice here, smooth and sexyyy
=
Omg most viewed in queendom?
=
love u guys!! AOA forever!!
=
Seolhyun!

All of us behind our screens: 
0:54
=
AOA BODIED this PERIODDDDDDDDDD
=
come on season 6, let's get sickening!
=
AOA doesn't need to win this show, after this performance they will be remembered for a long time.
=
so who wants to tell me the backup dancers instagram @s
=
King----Queen
Kingdom-----Queendom
=
I’m beyond happy they went on queendom because they’re just showing everyone that they still have their flare, they can make it work without choa/mina, and it’s allowing them to have fun and to perform again I hope after this fnc gives them a comeback
=
oww beautiful
=
i love this so much
=
Jajaja la versión cute de Egoistic 
=
not gonna lie, this probably the best cover song for this year. people finally see AOA's values.
=
Really Kicking! AOA still has it.
=
Seunghee hahaha
=
THIS JUST REMINDS BITCHES THAT AOA IS STILL THE SHITT
=
I don’t know why but this cover is stuck in my head all day
=
Regardless of what the final result, AOA is the true Queen of Queendom...
=
Even after weeks, I still think this deserved 1st.
=
Thank you Mnet, for once you're actually helping a group to go back where they belong : the top
People always disrespected AoA : too sexy, no good vocals except ChoA... I mean, guys they were trained by FNC in the first place, even their rappers can sing super well. And then, Jimin not being a real rapper... She went all the way to the semi finals of Unpretty Rapstar with nobody believing in her, and she spits fire all the time
=
Queendom SS1 end this day my top 5 stage 
1 AOA Egostic 
2 G-idle Lion
3 OH MY GIRL destiny 
4 G-idle Latata
5 Mamamoo Lucky
=
Just watched this three more times. AHHHHHHH!
=
2:51 Do you hear that.... That's the sound of an ambulance because everybody is dying
=
They are queens 
=
I wish they had a rap battle cause Mimi, Moonbyul, Soyeon and Jimin are all super good rappers and Mimi and Jimin are too often dismissed despite their talent!
=
I want a collab between Jimin and Moonbyul...
=
OH GOSHHH THIS IS LITTT♥️
=
i'm in love 
=
For me this is the Best performance for this round! Applaused! Good luck AOA  Looking forward to your Comeback 
=
I slay I slay, yes you slay girl.   
=
The power of a great song and performance that can make a group shine!
=
Yuqi: O^:
=
Omg i'm in love with the rapper
=
SEOLHYUN STEP ON ME
=
perfect !
=
i realy love solhyun voice so sexy soft..
=
2:05 THAT VOICE  ❤
=
AOA the Best ❤️
=
They are the best performers on the stage,  they charming all living things~
=
They ATE that Periodtttttt!!!!!!!!! . whoo chile I'm in awe
=
its not mamamoo's song.. they made it there own haha.. wow
=
Me watching this in class and trying not to fanboy out loud isn’t good for me 
=
Ngl they really slayed this performance.
=
Wowwwwwwwwww amazing cover
=
AOA made a very smart move and the performance is really good. For them, ranking is really meaningless, the whole point of going to the show is to get back to general public's eyes and I think after last two performances, they definitely manage to do so, given this performance is still trending no 1 on Nxxxr.
=
Fighting AOA
=
Aoa already won the whole show for this performance alone
=
Moonbyul: is that really our song?

Queen recognizing Queens❤
=
Jimin's intro rap is Iconic"
=
AOA COMEBACK IN NOVEMBER "AOA IN THE MOONLIGHT" ELVIS AND AOA FIGHTING!!!!
=
How seolhyun sings the verse so soft is
=
Who wants a AOA and MAMAMOO collab after queendom because I definitely do!!
=
I love this song with aoa voice,, really enjoyed
=
This is really the most iconic performance of Queendom! INDEED!
=
I almost forget that was actually a mamamoo's song
=
1:40 that guy is so handsome♥♥
=
I absolutely love Seolhyun's voice, it's so pleasing to listen to!! ❤❤
=
I'VE TOTALLY FALLEN FOR SEOLHYUN'S VOICE 
=
Is it just me? I like to listen this song on repeat.
=
Woww Daebak! I love so much this Song with Aoa voice's.
=
me watching this everyday: 1:36
=
Literally goosebumps!!!
=
I really like this 
=
They don’t need sexy or revealing outfits to look super sexy / classy  my girls
=
I am living for this
=
0:53 if this aint me tho
=
I have officially found the hottest woman I've ever seen....Seolhyun
=
Road to 100m 
=
hyejeong's visuals actually cut
=
Jimiiiiinnnnnn ❤
=
i just wanna see what all the korean comments say cause this must've been a huge statement and it went so viral!!
=
The entire fandom: 2:48
=
The best of the night AGAIN!
=

=
AMOOOOO
=
Absolute Favourite
=
deserved to be #1 ahhhh
=
Go army ladies.
=
1:35 3:03 same yuqi same
=
Didn't think I'd see a death drop in kpop.
=
Seolhyun is so talented. She is a good singer, model and actress. 
=
 EVERYBODY AOA’S QUEENDOM SINGLE COMES OUT TOMORROW AND!! THEY ARE HAVING A COMEBACK IN NOVEMBER GET READY TO SUPPORT THE ANGELS 
=
AOA announced their comeback. i hope everyone who liked this supports !!!
=
This performance’s concept shows exactly how you can be absolutely sexy (and classy) without wearing cutesy or revealing or skintight clothing. And it’s so damn powerful, loved the whole performance. Female Kpop groups should take notes
=
just want to say, "YUNA"
=
im so so so so thankful that i decided to start watching Queendom. now i've been enlighted. i can't believe it took my seven years to before i realized how amazing AOA is
=
Omg AOA being a woke af group with those beautiful vooging boys at the end. This whole performance is spectacular. I hope they will win....
=
queendom reminds me how much I love AOA ❤
=
Honestly I thought this was the original version. This version is so good 
=
I still prefer the ori version but jimin's rap was brilliant!!!
=
This performance was mind blowing!!!! Now I really really really love theeeeemmmm. I fall in love really hard to Seolhyun. Not just pretty face and body but with oozing talents and charisma. And Jimin tooo. I love the coolness and the vocals of the other members were just mind blowing. Now I can't get over with this performance. It's been 1 month but I can't stop watching over and over again to this video.
=
This style of singing suits them
=
They made it sound like an Ariana Grande song, it's a good remix
=
The death drop was amazing
=
gidle were out of their minds when they downvoted this performance
=
AOA的天使们，加油！
=
Made the song their own! 
=
AOA kill the stage!
=
AOA ANNOUNCED COMEBACK IN NOVEMBER! ❤️
=
Let’s talk about Seolhyun’s grawl 2:02 
=
AOA will always be my fave gg
=
They totally smashed it - I love EVERYTHING they did here 
=
Original still my fav.
=
Awesome AOA!!! Great performance and concept!!!
=
Came back watching this after I watch Unpretty Rapstar Jimin vs Cheetah
=

=
I am male but I want cover this.
Their performance are amazing!!!!!!
=

=

=
I already watched this i guess 100 times more, i can hust watch this for 15 times a day! Dont know but i really love this performances. AOA is just so subjective and i hope the audience and the public get the message of this arrangement of the song and choreograph! Love always seolhyun! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I hope there company now see how good AOA are...
=
Viewers nya paling banyak daripada group yg lain,

=
Still not over it!
=
Just imagine if Choa and Mina is with them.
=
aoa  太强了
=
SO GOOD.
=
AoA fighting!!!!!!!!!
=
So sad that girl group real talent only shows if they enter this kind of show.... never know aoa vocal is this good, i mean i know they're good...but this is better than i expected..
=
look at these queens breaking gender stereotypes yes. slay.
=
Yuna have a very sweet but strong and clean voice
Hyejeong have that husky and creamy voice
Seolhyun have that airy but soft and angelic voice
Chanm have that cute voice and sweet voice
Jimin rap is everything!
=
Really addict to this performance
=
I'm living for this new side of AOA. I hope they will make more concepts like Mamamoo's egotistic
=
Am watching this everyday twice a day in hope AOA will have a decent comeback ! I want the queens back although a lot have other activities they are so underrated compared to the new groups
=
Wow this is my song they slayed. Queens.
=
OMG JIMIN IS JUST asdfgh so powerful on the stage 
=
When someone farts in class but you don’t smell but everyone else does,and you pretend you do 0:53
=
Jimin is so legit. I'd go bi for her. 
=
I've fallen in loveeeee
=
AOA QUEENS!!
=
This is my religion!
=
3:53 YAAAAASSSSS HUNNNNNNNNYYYYY‼️
=
Srunghee reaction is everything. And that cross dressing concept!!!  Laf it
=

=
I love this challenge!!!! make everyone in the group do the best version...LOVEEEEEE
=

=
ELVIS AOA  will comeback in november
=
hell yeah i'm bisexual
=
=
AOA slayed
=
Im so sad because jimin is a queen and she take poor lines! :(
=
HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES ON THIS SHOW.
=
This performance made such a big statement, in a still dominantly close minded society like korea. It was amazing i absolutely loved it.
=
DO NOT EVER UNDERESTIMATE WOMAN!!!
=
The audience member with the bisexual wristband has my heart.
(0:41)
=
I love how Jimin starts this song, I love the rhythm of the rap
=
This is too powerful. I hope AOA will going to have a comeback with this kind of vibes.
=
Jimin opening is so impactful
=
I absolutely adore Oh My Girl's reaction to this performance. How into it were they? Super excited, which was great to see. AOA made this song their own with this show. I hope they get to perform it again live. It would be incredible ❤️❤️
=
Cant describe with word
*They did it so well* n
*They are rocking the stage*
=
BEST COVER EVERRRRR
=
It's feel like it was their song :")
=
After countless view of this video and other groups, i still did not get it why AOA did not win this. Just mind boggling. Other groups maybe has flashier stage props but i do not think no one performance did better job than AOA of nailing the basics of song cover and performance.
=
Ahh i start to wacth this program and wait it every week after watch aoa perform mamamoo song, such big surprise and great arrangement...really different from aoa that i know before...really good song and wonderfull performance...
=
I feel happy for both groups. I am an AOA fan, and I've always thought they are really talented
=
AOA SLAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY~~~~~~~~~!!!!!! *CLAPS
=
I didn't know AOA expect their song Heart Attack but Queendom made me fall for them now I looking for my bias
=
YES ! ! ! ! 
FILL THE DEEP EXID VOID IN MY heart, WITH YOUR ENDLESS AOA POWER! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 



I was just crying over not having a group with EXID's sexy concept, but now I found AOA. 
What are the odds??
=
Thank you Mamamoo for this song <3
=
I can watch this on repeat!
=
cant move on with this,, rip play button since queendom
=
seolhyun damnn itt!!!!
=
Y'all that's beyond powerful woah!!!
=
QUEENSSSSS!!! ✨♥✨♥
=
AOA THE BEST!!
=
I repeated jimins rap at least a100 times.
=
Omg who are they?! They are amazing, love the girl that with the braids
=
AOA is great! Ji Min is fantastic as always!
=
Jimin~~
Hwasa~~
=
Consider me a new fan
=
IM SO CRAZY OVER THIS SONG THAT I BLAST IT ON LOUD SO THE WHOLE COMPLEX THAT I LIVE IN CAN HEAR THESE QUEENS .... THIS PERFORMANCE  WAS LIT ...
=
AOA made this song like their own.  
=
I will never get over how much they ATE this
=
FULL CAM PLEASE!!!!!
=
wala akong sawang panoorin to promise ang galing nila dito
=
mamamoo x aoa collab plssss
=
Goddamit.. why FNC not use this kind of music to AOA..
=
However did the background screen spelt Egotistic wrong........ *OCD TRIGGERED*
=
Welcome to another episode of... The Internet Can't Stop Talking About It That's Why I'm Here
=
Im addicted to Jimin's rap part.
=
no idea what gidle was thinking when they downvoted aoa. this performance was my personal fav. - random wiz*one
=
producer: are you sure about this? the cross-dresser dance----
AOA: YES!

MY INNER GAY : YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS BISH *SCREAM LOUD*
=
This will be a legend stage of AOA
=
Sometimes, I just come here to watch Jimin's rap but end up watching the whole video.
Z I M I N says We The Queen
=
Bro two words
SEOLHYUNS VOICE
=
Such wild stage! AOA totally owned this round. They should do the girl crush concept for their next comeback!
=
Seolhyun looks so hot! Asfg-- I love her
=
I live for Seunghee's signature nosebleed reaction 
=
Love that this show has older kpop groups I grew up with AOA, Park Bom <3
=
1.35 look at Yugi face  very interesting
=
Introduce me to them
=
WHEN THE BOYS CAME OUT I LOST IT
=
Jimin's rap is so daebak!
=
THAT WAS AMAZING.
MY WIG GOT SNATCHED.
MY JAW DROPPED TO EARTHS'S CORE.
=
this is so good, their voices suit the song very well
=
Their voices made my mind stop ❤توقف عقلي اصواتهن تهبل ....
=
1:35 
Me too Yuqi
=
i really liked this version very powerful
=
love this performance so much 
=
1:39 they lowkey WENT OFF
=
I like this performance best! Big heart <3
=
Keep repeating 1:47
=
Wow who made the instrumental, the new instrumental is _amazing_
=
1:36
=
Who is back here after the group performances in the 3rd round?
=
0:26
=
Please god let them have a comeback 
=
daMN they looK mF ho T straight up one if the best stages in kpop ever probably
=
Not hating on mamamoo. But AOA deserved the win
=
one of the best things that happened in 2019
=
Am i the only one who thinks Chanmi looks stunning? like oh my god
=
*WOMEN IN SUIT IS SO POWERFUL*
*LIKE IM SO GAY RN AOA SLAYED* 
=
seolhyun’s voice is so mesmerizing
=
when the fine hairs drop, the cherry blossoms will fall too. I don't wanna be a flower that's meant to fall. I'm the tree.
=
This perfomance is too over quality I can’t
=
DRAG QUEENS CAME OUT I WAS LIKE SO HYPE THATS LITERALLY A MAMAMOO PULL OFF AOA 
=
Seolhyun's voice sounds really great here, I just want to keep on hearing her voice 
=
Wow. My bias Yuna slays again.  I love how this is balanced between Seolhung, Hyejeong, and Yuna.  Sounds like AOA but also something new.
=
AOAs version looks Mamamoo approved. Especially Moonbyul. I wish she secretly snuck off and trained/performed with them.
=
2:44 SAME REACTION lmao
=
11 mil views and counting, so proud of them
=
1:36. It's basically everyone watching this video, lol :D
=
1:36 My same reaction
=
AOA SAID FVCK TOXIC MALE 
MASCULINITY YAS ️‍
=
Seunghee is shook  I’m glad that my beloved Oh My Girl loves my beloved AOA ❤️
=
thank you, Queendom. I stan AOA harder than before because of this ^.^
=
1:36 Same Yuqi SAME
=
Why did I like this vers of song the most sorry original singer
=
0:44 HAD ME DEAD ON THE FLOOR
=
its ep 8 already but this still hunting me huhu i luv et.
=
The rap is fire 
=
12M ❤
=
i just love love love this so much
=
dude i'm loving seolhyun's vocals in this performance, she's giving me sultry britney vibes in the BEST way
=
Que hermoso 
=
really awesome cover version.
=
12M 
=
Jimin AOA feat jimin BTS? Jimin Aoa the rap, Jimin BTS the vocal. good collaboration, right? kkk~
=
Keep streaming
=
ไม่ใช่แฟนคลับ​ aoa​ แต่ดูโชว์นี้​เป็นติ่งทันทีเลยจ้าา​  มาเป็นแฟนคลับ​ aoa​ กันเยอะนะ
=
Can we talk about how Seolhyun’s improvement?? Like she used to have no lines in their debut song and now she’s handling a chorus. I literally cry as I’m so proud of her
=
I never thought that seolhyun had this unique voice, actually I'm in love with her voice now and I was one of those who think that's when she was popular only cuz of her look and body and not for talent, but she proved me I was wrong, I'm sorry seolhyun u r pretty and talented a full package
=
i wanna know what all the korean comments say lol
=
For those who didn't know, Jimin's mic was a gift from Seolhyun. She kept it for an important occasion, and this is the first time she's using it
=
AOA the Best ❤️
=
I'd hate to say the obvious but this is the best performance since queendom started. Quendom is literally meant 'rebirth of aoa'. Look it up.
=
Jimin upgraded from a motherf*ckin' top madam to a tree and I'm here for that
=
I don’t even stan, I didn’t even know about them until I saw this, but they totally should have won this
=
I like this arrangement better than the original... and I already like the orig Egotistic sm! Daebak AOA
=
Who else want to join that party on the stage?
=
Jimin' rap is cool!!!
=
Is it just me or does Jimin look and sound a bit like Britney Spears when she do the rap. BTW Jimin is my bias in AOA.
=

=
Any Gumis notice that Jimin used her special mic?
=
The homophobes are shook

I DUNNO WHY THERE ARE TOO MANY MOOMOOS WHO DONT LIKE AOA'S PERFORMANCE WHEN HERE'S ME ( A CERTIFIED MOOMOO ) LOVING IT SOOOO MUUUUUUUUUCH O.O
=
If there are seven girls, the stage will be very good. I live AOA
=
ラップかっこいい
=
I can't stop repeating Jimin's rap in the beginning
=
one of the most exciting performances to see is when groups transforms others music and make it their own. the collaboration and talents have exploooooded. thanks mnet. you've brought us heaven-dome.
=
I can’t believe a group with such good vocals like literally wth
=
I come here EVERY SINGLE DAY
=
this makes me realize that two from the whole show came from Unpretty Rapstar
=
If AOA have this mature boss girl vibe as their next comback concept, I'm in!!!!
=
THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF AOA EVERRRRRR ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Jimin Rap part in the beginning already KILL it 
=
1:36 she’s soo cute ❤️
=
1:36 A whole mood
=
the best performance so far, so elegant
=
This is AOA 
=
My queens 
=
Do anyone realize that green mic jimin holding in this perfomance is the one she said she want to use it when she go solo in chanmi vlog? T.T I am glad she finally got the chance to use it
=
Moonbyul looks like shes in heaven 
No but seriously its cute she looks so excited
=
The best so far
=
1:36 hehehehe
=
Why is there's no subtitle right after moonbyul commented
=
Yuqi got me hahahaha
=
i'm a moomoo, and this style reminds me of other mamamoo concepts like decalcomanie and piano man, i ADORE it!!! aoa absolutely killed it, and this song in this style is something i didn't know i needed, they kept it fresh and owned it. aLSO, THE DANCERS???? AT 2:34??? AND HOW THEY POP TF OFF AT 3:46 AND ONE ACTUALLY DEATH DROPS????? I'M DEAD.
=
❤️
=
YES!!!!
=
1:47
=
Anyone else notice the typo in Egotistic on the stage LEDs? It’s constantly going by and showing that the producers made the mistake lol
=
1:36 q porra de penteado é esse? ;-;
=
"Moms are gonna love this"
*after a few mins*
Jimin: *cUz U a FuCkIn PuSs PuSs!*
=
This brings back the memories of when kpop was fun and not all about views, streaming and less fan wars
=
Jimin looks like she’s becoming more healthy again I’m so happy and relieved
=
I have fallen in love with Jimin over Queendom.  She seriously doesn't give a damn as to what anyone thinks
=
No one literally no one
Jimin:
I'm the motherfuckin top madam
=
Jimin: **swears**
Lovelyz: **gasps**
Mijoo: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
=
Jimin gained alittle weight she looks so much better
=
Jimin doesn’t come here to play but she comes to slay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
i think is time for chanmi to make her solo debut she's so underrated
=
AOA comeback november. Confirmed by FNC. Please support. 
AOA IN THE MOONLIGHT 
=
Regardless of what people think of AOA’s skills and concepts, there’s no denying that every single member of AOA is strong and beautiful. When AOA lost some members, I was hurt because they were at the peak of their career. And I thought they’d disband, especially since Choa was a popular main vocal of AOA. However despite having all odds against them, AOA is still performing exceptionally well and through Queendom, AOA has shown us many many charms - there’s the sensual and elegant miniskirt performance, powerful mamamoo cover, seolhyun’s beauty, hyejeong’s funny antics and sweet vocals, chanmi’s hard work put into dancing (check out her YouTube channel if you havent!), Yuna’s (she has a youtube channel too!) beautiful strong vocals in every performance, AOA Cream’s cutie sexy performance and the Jimin’s stage presence when rapping and doing rock. I was sad that seolhyun couldn’t participate in this performance but it also showed me that even when seolhyun is absent, the four of them are able to showcase their performance amazingly. Clearly, the AOA members and AOA as a group are respectable artistes who’ll do well and shine if they’re given the chance to. Fighting AOA!!!!

EDIT: they got last for this stage... I think it’s mainly because it was an AOA cream + Jimin performance . But
I’m still Glad we got to hear a slightly different version of I’m jelly , and Jimin got to live her rock star dream while killing her rap!!
=
Who else misses AOA Black 
=
Chanmi's rap is addicting.
=
No one : ...
Yuqi : *_i think moms are gonna love this_*
=
Oh My Girl are AOA’s biggest fans  always has the biggest reactions
=
no one:
actually no one:
seriously no one ever:
yuqi: moms are gonna love this
=
yuna is such an underrated vocalist! and on top of that she’s gorgeous!!
=
i honestly wished Jimin did this performance rocking a guitar, just like in AOA Black. I mean, they had AOA Cream here, why not some AOA Black?
=
Nobody:
Yuqi: *Moms gonna like it*
meanwhile......
Jimin : hold my freaking PU$$
=
This Jimin rock concept is probably the closest we'll ever get to AOA Black now...
=
i love how the girls say: "the moms are gonna love this", and after that, jimin appears on stage calling everyone puss with her rock band
=
“Puss” is so legendary :)) maybe Jimin is the only one who don’t fcking care about cursing on a tv show :))
=
G idle: I think moms are gonna love this 
Jimin: *curses and pulls her pinky in front of a camera* 
EDIT: sorry, didn’t know it was her pinky, but thank you for letting me know. 
=
OMG... Jimin is so coooooooooooool
=
AOA is literally everything!! : 
sexy : yes! cute : yes! cool: yes! go, girls! the ranking doesn't matter you are a winner already
=
The camera work didn't do yunas high note a justice
=
AOA didn't come here for the competition, they came to do what they had never done before. Come on, AOA let's kill this show
=
Even if AOA finish last of Queendom they are the Real winner ! QUEEN !!
=
HYEJEONG IS SO GORGEOUS WHY NOBODY TALKS ABOUT HER
=
Jimin never fails to remind us why she is the leader xD
=
Okay aoa is queen but was it just me that noticed that hot backup male dancer
=
Omg They are all so pretty they look like barbie dolls especially Hyejeong
=
If it catches bom attention it’s worthy for eyes 

Jk...but like for real tho
=
It's funny that all the korean comments are about Seunghee. Oh my girl is getting popular in Korea☺️
=
Oh My Girl's reactions are hilarious . Especially Seunghee "I'm Jelly Baby" . Mijoo of Lovelyz also has the best reactions. Jimin killed it btw.
=
Jimin is my ub for reason.
Her stage presence
Her rap
Her beauty
Her being top madam
I really miss her and AOA
=
Damn Yuna,she's just so pretty
=
Fell inlove with Jimin in this show. She's so funny and full of energy especially during the interviews. 
=
was actually expecting them to bring back aoa black for this like imagine them coming out to queendom as a band omg BUT THIS IS COOL TOO
=
I really like Seunghee's reaction to all of the performances in the show
=
Jimin doesn't need a secret weapon.  She is the ultimate weapon.
=
I don’t know why but i got the same feeling of that stage of troublemaker kiss at the end  

Ps (Sorry for my bad English normally i speak french )
Pps (i really wanted a kiss )
=
Yuqi: cutie sexy
She just described *real queens*
=
Jimin showing these young cats who the queen cat is. And they're just puss. Bom is already on a whole nother level so.
=
Seunghee's "I'm Jelly BABY" killed me AAHAHA
=
Isn't the guy dancing with chanmi, sunmi's rlly hot back dancer
=
AOA was till now the most diverse group on this show, first they went with something sensual and sexy, then they challenged themselves with egoistic cover and showed us a whole new side of them and now we got AOA cream and Jimin‘s iconic performance 
=
doubters : aoa is done
aoa: let's show people we are real queens
round 1 first time as a five group unit STILL killed the stage with miniskirt
round 2 shows they can do more than sexy and rocks a cool version of egotistical
round 3 starts off with an incredible duet with killer harmony fallowed by a tri-fecta of cute sexy and cool all on one stage
doubters: we would like to have our comment stricken from the record
=
Hyejeong is smokin hot in this style holy crap
=
AOA NEED COMEBACK ASAP BEFORE 2019 ENDED 
AND PLEASE BRING ALL AOA GIRLS BACK LIKE BINGLE BANGLE ERA 
If ode y’all agree, please give thumbs up and root louder and harder for AOA 
=
What can I say!? Aside from my NFia-Elvis heart celebrating for this stage because Jimin and JDon reunited, THIS STAGE WAS HELLA AMAZING!!! My words aren't enough to describe how talented and powerful my girls are!!! They're just breathtakingly wonderful!!! I'm so proud! IT MAKES ME FEEL FUCKING PROUD THAT I STAN AOA!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!
=
AOA CUTE, SEXY AND ROCKTAR PERFECT
=
Oh my girls reaction when watch AOA always make me 
=
After this stage i can tell for sure, AOA didn't come for the win or the compitition, but istead to tell their fans, that AOA is still out there and it is kicking!!!
=
3:47 seunghee lmaooooo i can't with her 
=
JIMIN'S PERF IS JUST SO LIT!!! AND ALSO AOA CREAM IS SO PRETTYYYYYY!!! COMEBACK!!
=
The way lovelyz's staff were SHOOKETH then intercut by oh my girl screaming in awe is  a r t
=
Cha hyunseung is everywhereee
=
They look so gorgeous here. And I love the 2019 I'm Jelly Baby version and Jimin is such a top madam as always.
=
The only gg who can appear sexy while doing a cute concept
=
G-idle: I think moms are gonna love this
*camera pan over to Jimin swearing in Puss*
=
This performance was amazing.
Also I really recommend you guys watch queendom, Hyejeong is legit comedy gold. She makes everyone laugh
=
For those who were asking where Seolhyun was. She is currently filming her drama called My Country. You can watch it on Netflix
=
It would be so savage if they included Puss' rap part but overall, this is so good and as and Elvis, Im not ever gonna forget this performance of them. Im still.crying omg i love them.
=
Whatever AOA does, turns out they’re going to be sexy anyway 
=
I watch queendom due to (G)I-dle but fall in love with Jimin Abd Hyejeong
=
AOA deserves to win this show, their performances so far have been awsome and they are the only group that have done something 'different', to say the least, witht heir songs... And that's not mentioning that they have showed everybody that they aren't just pretty faces as many thought before this.
=
C'mon Elvis streaming like we're streaming to Egotistic
=
Jimin really wants to be in a first place indeed.. And she really nailed it..
=
mijoo cheering when jimin sweared- me too sweetie
=
Jimin is such a badass, I was grooving to the whole song
=
Moms:Ooh we love this lady lady lady~
Jimin:CUZ A FUCkiN PuSS pUsS
*Moms left the group*
=
This is literally like how you would perform the same song in school and in college.
=
Lovelyz : oh my god 
.
.
Mijoo : YEAHHHH!!!
=
She looks so healthy now, I wanna cry, my baby pls take care of u, you're fantastic, in the stage and smiling is what you deserve. :")))))))
=
2:21 jimin scream WHOAAAA
=
jimin’s part makes me miss aoa black even more
=
i miss the good old 2nd gen cute concepts now- i miss it when everyone accepted cute concepts
=
I'm absolutely in love with Yuna's look here  
Also wow Jimin killed it 
=
I love how AOA enjoy performing on stage
=
when Jimin sing puss puss, all i think is all the elder who become the special evaluator 
=
Damn they are killin it on this show every performance feels like a concert like I feel so hype right now ‍
=
Jimin’s performance with J.Don was so iconic!!!!! And I just love Seunghee’s reaction!!
=
OMG！！！Jimin I LOVE YOU！
=
OMG! This is one of my favorites AOA song. It’s so underrated but this song proves just how versatile they are. They can do cute concepts too!
=
4:32 tHIS IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, MIJOO!
=
This is the first AOA song that I've heard and loved instantly. I even study the choreography to this song hahaha. I love this girls.
=
slayed as always on different sylesss thats AOA
=
0:43 what sunmi’s male dancer doing here 
=
i really wish hyejeong-seolhyun-chanmi secretly learn how to play band instrument and then AOA will comeback with band concept for the next round ;;w;;
=
4:38 I need to watch more of her
=
MY RESPECT FOR MIJOO AND OH MY GIRLS FOR SHOWING MY MOOD
=
Jimin: *curses* 
Everyone: *cheers* 
Me: „iconic“
=
Wahh i fell in love with AOA thanks to Queendom. This performance is dope as hell.
=
i just really hope they would get 1st place in this performanceee
=
3:00 Shin Jimin
=
Streaming always Elvis, let's counting
=
I had a big goosebumps when Jimin did these rap
=
WHO LOVE YUNA 
=
I always love the reaction of OH MY GIRL! They're so cute.
=
i always love OMG reaction to AOA perf.. hahaha....
=
one of the bakup dancer is sunmi's legendary dancer (the one with chanmi)
=
I can't help but find it hilarious Mijoo is the only 1 in Lovelyz room hyped for Jimin lmao the rest are all just shocked she's all YA thats what I'm talking about lmao.
=
I love AOA because they always give for the gays all kind of performances the gays deserve. Thanks for all AOA <3
=
Jimin don’t play!!! >.< This takes us down AOA Memory Lane !! 
I really loved all the stages especially this one, even if they were last for this stage! Loved how Jimin was able to show off how talented she is! 
Also really happy how healthier Jimin looks!
=
AOAが好きすぎる
=
the reasong why AOA placed 6th cause of points getting to hyejeong and minnie perf. and chanmi danced thats makes me sad cause of having a least points that makes their placed 6th even though their perf of a whole group gets a higher but it takes them down and placed 6th thats why.
=
RIP replay button AHAHAHAHA 
=
4:31 when you're not too innocent
Yaaaaaaas!!!
=
3:50 im dying from laughter my god Seunghee HAHAHAHAHAHA
=
ahaha diference between  reaction at Jimin puss puss
4:30 Lovelyz -shocked mothers
4:33 OH MY GRIL be like: " YAAAA, P.U.S.S,YAYA"
=
AOA Cream is so refreshing i love it
Jimin is one of the best leaders also with this stage presence and mindset
queendom really helped me stan them and im happy this show exists
=
No one:
Jimin: ...I..
Oh my Girl: KYAAAAAAAAAAAAA
=
The winner of this show is decided by the success of the song released and by far, AOA seem to be benefiting the most from Queendom (Oh My Girl as well) so AOA might chart the highest
=
Jimin's stage presence is higher than her height
=
They did a great job! Yooa was so cute when she said "Chanmi"! I love them. ❤ It's also good that Jimin featured Seunghyub on puss performance.
=
More than 10 times watch this.. no boring..so entertaining...
=
Seunghee's *I'm Jelly Baby* gave me all of the UwU I needed
=
that is Sunmi's dancer 
chanmi's partner
=
yooa saying chanmi in 0:12 shes so cuteeee
=
AHHHHHH AOA CREAMMMM
=
Love Hyejeong ❤️
=
Even if this landed them last place think about all of the concepts AOA brought to Queendom
Sexy - Miniskirt
Girl Crush - Egoistic/Egotistic
Emotional - Instagram
Cute + Rock/Punk/Rap - Jelly Baby/T4SA/Puss
Sexy Girl Crush Cowboy Luchador - Sorry
=
OMG I never think Seunghyub will be here and yes I think Jimin’s show remind me of SMTM too lol
=
I never thought I'd see a new performance by AOA Cream. Very cool to see. Jimin with a band gave me AOA Black vibes. It was exciting to see her perform with Seunghyub of N.Flying, their little brother group from FNC. The only thing I didn't like was the swearing.
=
AOA should get 1st place just for Jimin’s performance alone 
=
Ok just end this and give the win to AOA!
=
WOW JIMIN IS SO GOOD
=
Sweet & hot Stage 
=
I see sunmi's male dancer?!
=
Slay Queen Jimin ❣️❣️❣️
=
I love oh my girl's reactions, they were so hyped up during puss!
=
I wish they had this version for download.
=
Hyunseung I’m trying to watch the performance TAT
=
seunghee : i'm jelly baby
CUTE
=
I live for seunghee reaction
=
1M  keep str3aming Elvis 
=
hyunseung is everywhere wtf bro take a rest lmaoooo
=
Personally, I love Chanmi's rap from the AOA Cream time.
=
I Love You Jimin!!!!❤❤❤❤
=
I'm Jelly Baby is still my jam, one of my all time favourite kpop songs, that concept was everything!!! And our top madam spitting fire there!! My Elvis heart nearly exploded~ !!
=
Jimin is back love it!!!!
=
the bests <3
=
1 MILLION ALREADY, LET'S GO QUEENS
=
AOA comes to show that they can do every concept and they kill it!!!
=
jimin's part
=
3:48 Seunghee cleverly referencing the song title, she is comedy gold. 
=
Jimin killed this 
=
We don’t have Seolhyun, Choa, and Mina
=
Is that hyunsung oppa aaaaa my hrart <3 <3 i love prof of jimin she is so lalay hhhh
=
Got Jimin
=
lol I didn't expect Seunghyub to appear but now that I'm thinking about it, he is the most reasonable and, in my opinion, perfect choice 
=
Stan AOA♥️
=
I'm missing Choa so much :'(
=
Take care of yourself guys AOA coming back in November 
=
I miss this songs 
=
Omg~ i love them AOA my rap queen
=
I looking for this mp3....Can i know where i can download the studio version mp3???
=

Oh my girl is no. 1 fan of AOA specially Jimin
=
Hyejeong is so beautiful 
And chanmi is freakin cute 
=
Show me the money!<3
=
Slayyyyeddddd 
=
if there could be a ranking for best reaction too, top 1 would be Oh My Girl 
lololol i love themmmmm
=
AOA you're  literally SLAY THE STAGE
=
I love they change the beat for Jelly Baby :o it become a lot cooler
=
I really like the live band action. Great!
=
I need the studio version
=
AOOOAAAAAAAAA QUEENS
=
QUEEEEEEEEEENNN JİMİN ✨✨✨✨✨
=
I’m Jelly Baby was my favorite song for so long when it came out :,) Hit me right in the memories
=
Tbh when people mention AOA, only Seolhyun & Jimin that comes to mind but thanks to Queendom I kinda gain respect for all of the members. (Well now my bias is funny Hyeojong) They're full of colors & gorgeous.They could pull of every concept elegantly, it shows how mature they are in this industry.
=
I want AOA to win this freaking show so baaaaad!!!! They deserved that comeback! They've shown literally a lot of things we've never seen before!!! And it's such a waste not to see them perform on stage!
=
I miss AOA Black :(
=
Work that hair HyeJeong!! Yaaaaaaas, looking like a fierce drag queen <3
=
I wish them perform Elvis 
=
Aaa Jimin ♡♡♡♡♡
=
1M views guys, keep fighting, streaming, and shared
=
Jimin
=
When Jimin is gigil hahaha go girl! 
=
4:52 she is enjoying herself
=
THEY'RE HAVING A COMEBACK!!!
=
where is ' Like A Cat'
=
4:32 look at the stylist in glasses
=
I love this stage way too much
=
"My mom's going to love this"
Ouch
=
waaahhhhh leader jimin!!! i love her <3 she slayed the stagee
=
Jimin looks so badass lol
=
Still imagine that there was aoa black :")
=
I love that they showed off each members talents! They could all honestly be solo artists like they’re amazing as a group and they can each hold their own and they can do every concept! AOA and Elvis fighting! 
=
AOA really stand during all the competition.... a great group, great visual, great rap, great performances...the BEST
=
I miss Jimin's rap so much.
=
When seunghyub came out. 
OH FREAKING YESSSSS
=
I love mijoo lol, the other members of lovelyz probably dont cuss????
=
AoA went in and let have!
=
Jimin!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤❤
=
4:35 binnie having the time of her life having long hair
=
i love omg and aoa so much omg they are so funny
=
INEED JIMIN X JDON COMEBACK
=
@ 4:51 the wife is checking in with the wife. finds out she's thoroughly enamored and finds her uber adorable. *smiles a foolish smile bcuz that be her when her sun is dazzling*
=
For international fans, seolhyun had another schedule. She’s acting in a drama recently. Hope she can perform with aoa soon.
=
AoA and Jimin, so sadly... But i like Jelly baby♫♥
=
3 things.
1. Chanmi is an underrated rapper
2. Don’t ever question Jimin as a rapper. She has really grown so much as a rapper after all these years after Unpretty Rapstar.
3. I really need a full cam of Solar reaction to Jimin performance, as Puss is like Solars favorite pastime 
=
love how oh my girl screamed at the part when jimin said a bad(?) word
=
TALENTED QUEENS!!! I’m living for this amazing performance!!
=
QUEENSSS
=
can i ask where is seolhyun?
=
If this performance doesn't get top 3, I'm fighting someone
=
I Love hyejeong outfit
=
Wae wae they're cuties and so damn sexy at the same time!
=
4:32 my dear Mijoo being the biggest mood as always lmaoo
=
Jimin is *bad ass.* Love her.
=

My FNC stan heart can't handle these 
=
Seunghee is a mood
=
Jiminn
=
the backup male dancer is sunmi’s backup dancer hahahahah
=
Jimin's shout hahhahha 
=
Jimin controls the stage
=
Jimin is killing it
=
The way Moonstar was looking at Solar tho... :)
=
Hyejeong ah 
=
it is like their own concert, especially for Jimin's part
=
AHHH  JIMIN FANTASTIC! WOOOOOOW! I LOVE IT
=
THEY SLAYED
=
i missed aoa cream :" )))) yes yes
=
HyeJeong is so beautifulll 
=
while watching jimin's puss performance, the girl groups were like...
mamamoo: matured middle-aged women who were enjoying the vibe
g-idle: average fans who also enjoying the vibe like mamamoo
omg: high school fangirls who were shocked and at the same time amazed at the performance
lovelyz: kindergarten students who were needed to cover their ears when they heard the curse word (well, except for mijoo hahaha)
=
Can we please get an AOA cream come back
=
0:28-0:31 is that guy the backup dancer for sunmi???
=
Golden Tambourine Jang Do Yeon's Puss brought me to Unpretty Rapstar Jimin's Puss and finally to this Puss. Woah what a ride
=
Jimin and Seunghyub look so good together
=
omg AOA cream what a throwback
=
I love Yuna's outfit so much
=
Considering AOA have a very reliable main rapper Jimin, tbh I think Chanmi's rapping voice is decent tho, it sounds nice and cool.
=
AOA FIGHTING!!!
=
Chanmi should rap more! Hopefully she raps more in future songs! She’s so good!
=
i love their performance! i love jimin, and hey who's that guy with her?
=
I really like Oh My Girl's reactions towards AOA perfs. The first time, they can'r handle the sexiness...and now they are rooting for the curse word. They really are a bunch of kids 
=
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS!!!
=
the baby remix is so cute ikdndndnd i love it
=
I focus to sunmi dancer 
=
Wheres Seolhyun :<
=
Ok but Jimin's presence tho!
=
For those who haven’t watched Queendom - this is what one of the members said that got me really sad and sentimental
When Hyejeong said 
“I want to act. I want to be on stage. I want to interact with the fans. I want to still do this and that’s why I am still in FNC” (her company)
=
Omg sunmi’s hot backup dancer, i love you baby
=
04:29 Lovelyz
04:34 Oh My Girl
Girls with a same grupal concept but they take it on different way hahaha
=
Elas arrasam em um nível 
=
OH MY GOSH SEUNGHYUB
PUSSSSSS
=
where’s seolhyun?
=
is that kasper as the back up dancers ?
=
does anyone notice hyejeong was the only one wearing flats during i'm jelly baby stage
=
OMAIGADD JIMINN!!
=
What are the chances you get a cuss word on MNet? - 0.1%
And who owned that chance? - AOA.
=
AOA THE ACE OF ANGELS GODDESS THEY GOT ALL
=
I really think that aoa is going to win every single time
=
Seunghyub
=
Luv u AOA elvis thailand
=
where is seolhyun?
=
Beautiful fantastic  AOA Forever ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
=
My underated Queens 
=
I just found out that Soyeon is like k-idol generator. Even before asked by Miyeon she knew what did Miyeon want to ask and answer it correctly
=
HYEJEONG IN A HIGH PONYTAIL, iM FCKFISBING DEAD
=
i love Chanmi's part in the beginning omg
=
This slaps those who say that AOA can only do sexy.
=
Omg finally i'm jelly baby 2019 ver this song still a bop
=
Jimin is a badass
=
Forget that ranking, This team is the winner in my heart.
=
Im screamiNG PUSS IS THE BEST FUcKING FLEX SONG AND IM SO GLaD theY GOT SEUNG TO DO IT EYE--
=
I see Sunmi’s male dancer
=
Chanmi is so underrated
=
My heart jumped out as soon as I heard Seunghyub's deep voice. Damn!!! AND PLEASE, MY NFIA AND ELVIS HEART IS SO HAPPY!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
=
YUNAAAAAA~~~~~~~~
=
Oh that guy is sunmi's dancer
=
Omg my fav song !!!!
=

=
jimin with rockstar anthem :
  moonbyul join the chat.
=
Don't forget to stream Come see me on both FNC and 1theK channel !
=
Streaming Elvis
=
I still can't understand why AOA hasn't even won 1st place yet despite their amazing performances. Popularity really matters in this show, even if they were voted as first by other groups on their second performances, yet the audience didnt vote for them that's why they ended as 3rd placer.. Unfair. I was even rooting for Hyejeong and Minnie for the 1st place 'cause they are the only "Duo" who had harmonizations until the end of the song and they sang it beautifully. That's how duo works, right..
=
OMG Jimin  ❤
=
Jimin is looking SO MUCH HEALTHIER since the start of the show. She was looking really sad and down at the beginning but now she's here tearing up the stage, I'm in the feels
=
Hyejeong is so cute. AOA angel of charms.
=
AOA still alive
=
I’m over enjoying watching the girls reactions  Lee seung hyub look so cool and handsome  jimin the best idol rapper 
=
Jimin-Jdon ic Comeback.
=
Fightingggg 
=
Here just to see the 'Puss'
=
Jimin rap part ahhhh I really wonder what she is talking about
Eng Sub plase!!!
=
1M 
=
Jimin really is something special
=
Seunghyeob 
=
although AOA last ranking this week, but I very like this performances
=
Yuna looks like a doll omg (she looks like one of Barbie's friends)
=
THATS MY MAN SEUNGHYUB
=
Nobody:
Me in a room of silent people shook from jimin swearing: 4:32
=
AOA FOR THE WINNER 
=
very ariana vibes !! & god yuna is gorgeous esp in that color and those hoops
=
AOA kills it!!!! <33333333333
=
If I'm at Korea rn, I'll buy their comeback album they're talking about in this show. I'll join the audience and support AOA because of this performance. JIMIN DOING THE PUSS AGAIN??? WOAH, AND AOA CREAM 2019??? SLAYED IT!!! THEY DESERVE TO RANK HIGH THIS TIME! COME ON, LET'S SUPPORT THEM UNTIL LAST!
=
Seunghyup( n flying)
=
AoA, they are unique
=
R E S P E C T 
PRO IS PRO
=
They are so great
=
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OMG AND LOVELYZ WHEN JIMIN CURSED JSJSJSJJAJS
=
Unpretty rapstar vivíssimo!!!
=
So PLEASE explain why this got sixth? I am dying to know why they said this was the worst out of the six
=
No matter what AOA is the best . Jimin is so cool. She doesn’t give a damn about what people say. My type of girl.
=
gggooooodddd daaammmnnn jimin!!!!
=
Why only four of them?
=
Jimin on last ep: I'm the tree !
Jimin on this ep: I'm the motherfucking top madam !
=
The return of motherf-ing top madam
=
Queen of rap! yeah thats Jimin AOA leader!
=
Jimin!!!!
=
Hyejeong is absolutely killing it with the hair/outfit. AOA CREAM is a sub-unit I really thought I'd see more of, I was obsessed when "I'm Jelly Baby" first came out. Hopefully the OT5 comeback is soon & people stop sleeping on the fact that they are a forever iconic girlgroup. -the remix of the song here is horrible tho lmao-
=
Karena kamulah JABLAY kata si Jimin... Kaya gitu kok bangga? 
=
4:37
=
oh my god....
Jimin...

=
Omg good job you did the best AOA cream  jimin always so extra  let’s go for no.1 
=
Why rank 6th :((((((((((((
=
ariana was right god is a women and HER  name is JIMIN

=
Why seoulhyun is missing all the queendom??? T.T my queen
=
chanmi
=
AOA HAVED ENTERED THE LEGENDS CATEGORY.. POINT BLANK PERIODT .
=
I can't believe that in AOA OT7 Yuna, Hyejeong and Chanmi were the least popular members 
=
AOA tá arrasando mds amo
=
❤️
=
3:50
=
Did you see how byul looked at solar :))) like dont worry it's too normal for my wife to act like this
=

AOA✨✨✨
=

=
AOA
=
Jimin's rap is so addicting
=

=
I need the full studio version of that AoA cream 
=
=
Las AOA CREAM fue lo que más  necesitaba
=
Jimin queen of rap
=
Rock chic she need group
=
Where’s seolhyun?
=
4:29 CULTURE SHOOOOOOCK! HAHAHAAA!
=
4:51 with her eyes wide open learning, this is wannabe-rapper solar's athem
=

=
I hope they release this version of I’m jelly baby 
=
AOA comeback november

=
I remember their first performance, they called Chanmi "Someone's missing." but now, they knew her name and called Chanmi. <3
=
Where's seolhyun?
=
What title this week
=
Jimin saved the performance in my opinion. I don't really like the cute concept. And dude, que girl kill it!! 
*Seunghee aways been the best  hahahahah
=
THE ONE AND ONLY
=
Watching them make me realize how much i miss them. Hope they can win
=
Jimin’s part is lit!!
=
I think aoa is in position six
=
Isn’t the person at 0:50 cha HyunSeung? (one of sunmi’s backup dancers)
=
AOA are amazing and they really know how to put on a performance!
=
ЧИМИН, ДЕТКА, ТЫ СРАЗИЛА МЕНЯ НАПОВАЛ БОЖЕ МОЁ СЕРДЦЕ
=
where's Seolhyun tho ?
=
My cutie Hyejeong onnie is really suited with that pink dress. I love your voice and your visual. On-nie saranghaeyo  i want to see your high note more! ♥️
=
Seunghee and Mijoo reaction over AOA's performance really made my day
=
Jimin : *curse
Lovelyz whole room : *gassppp
Mijoo : THATS HOW YOU DO IT BIJ
=
Hyejeong looks like Korean Ariana Grande
=
can I say that if jimin used harley quinn costume and J.Don as joker, It will be the best halloween gift ever. their character in this stage are so match with harley and joker
=
I really hope they can win at least one time on Queendom T.T *Jimin served* now they just need to cover ‘if you were me’
=
Should have a Kingdom together...
=
Director: so girls how many colors do wanna put in your performance
AOA: YESSSSSS
=
Where Seolhyun????
=
If seolhyun join this performance maybe they will perform im jelly baby and call you bae, aaahh cutie sexy kekekeke
=
Such a bop
=
AOA REALLY KNOWS HOW TO BLOW EVERYONE AWAY .... I LOVE AOA ,ELVIS FOREVER ...
=
I love Yuna so much omg
=

=
2:46

Can we also talk about how sexy NFlying's Seunghyeop is here
=
ANJIRRR BARU TAU GW ADA SEUNGHYUB AAAAKKKKKHHHH
=
Wow  the rapper girl so crasaaaaaaaaazzzzzzzyyyy I like his stage
=
I LOVE YOU AOA
=
Seolhyun??
=
YUNAAAA
=
AOA is killing the Queendom. They nailed all their performances. 
=
They are what we call "cutie sexy".
=
2:34
=
Where are the others?
=
I have no idea of why they're doing this but i wANT SOME MORE!
=
Where is other aoa members
=
aoa showed four concepts already in queendom: 
1st: miniskirt- sexy
2nd: egotistic- cool
3rd:  im jelly baby- cute sexy 
4th: puss- powerful
THEY DESERVE TO WIN THIS COMPETITION
=
I wonder how many people knew all of this songs from AOA, this performance was so nostalgic hahaha
=
I miss AOA Black
=
Isn’t the middle male backup dancer sunmi’s dancer?
=
Las amo, ok?
=
Where is Seolhyun ?
=
Where is seoulhyun？
=
Where is seolhyun?
=
Like someone said in the miniskirt performance they are actual angels
=
Where is seolhyun?
=
0:12 the way she calling Chanmi is so cute~~
=
Aoa يدعمون حتئ فرق شركتهم وشركة مو مهتمة فيهم 
=
where is Seolhyun?
=
i think Gi-dle and AOA have the same brain they both slayed all different concept. AOA has debuted as a band, cute, and sexy concept.
=
Jimin didnt use her chipmunk's voice hahahaha 
=
literally like a week ago i was like “we need an aoa cream comeback” and this happens
=
This is totally chanmi’s era!!!!
=
Who watched the whole performances of the 6 groups and this performance doesnt make me bored and it feels like i want more than the other performance?
=
really AOA can wear all the concepts, the sexy concept, the cute concept, the girl crush concept im-    ♥︎ _ ♥︎
=
My favourite performance and im not biased
=
1:06 1:06 
1:06 1:06
=
Top Madam showed everyone what a performance is
=
Lee Seung Hyub is such an underrated rapper, I mean, his power is no joke and I get goosebumps every time I watch him performing
=
Everybody: shooked with jimins bad word
Mijoo: THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT
 mijoo youre awesome
=
Unpretty Rapstar really did wonders for Jimin's skill. She went from decent rapper to a legit one. You slay gurl!!!!!
=
Holy cow, Jimin's one hell of a performer.
=
For the love of God, who did Hyejeong's hair!? Its not blendeeeeed. Still, she's gorgeous though.
=
2:44 this reminds me about AOA BLACK
=
when Jimin raised her voice, I know for sure that this stage's gonna be lengend-(no need to wait-for-it)-daryyyyyy
=
Mmm okay I haven't seen alot of the other group's yet but the much I've watched I feel like aoa just got it man 
Like I feel like these guys won't let aoa win cause like they are just so out there cause it's just so different and out of the box but i do hope the win or whatever this thing is cause dayum also am so proud of them
=
THIS THIS IS WHY I BIAS JIMIN
=
AOA THE BESTTT! I LOVEYOUUUUU 
=
Love seunghee's reactions
=
OMGGGG I’VE NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED  YEAHHHHH
=
I can't thinking straight everytime i saw jimin ❤️ help me❤️❤️❤️
=
4:50 the way moonbyul looked at solar. She's her freaking top madam. #moonsun
=
Ahhhh!!! ¡Cha Hyunseung! 
=
I Fr**KIN LOVE interaction of Lee Seung Hyub and Jimin. I ship them cuz they are on fire
=
Jimin 
=
seunghyub + jimin again oH MY GOD YES
=
*SEUNGHEE BECAME AN AOA STAN*
=
4:33
=
Omg! Sunmi's sexy back up dancer oppa is here!!
=
i love aoa TT
=
❤
=
ok but this show is basically meant for AOA, look at them glow-
=
AOA = QUEENS AND EVERYONE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT!
=
Jimin stole the show. I did not expect that at all.
=
Yuna is a princess. So elegant and pretty TT__TT She actually has really good body control. I love watching her dance.
=
The versatility of AOA is daebak! They can do sexy and cute concepts. They can wear miniskirts and tuxedos. They can sing ballad/soft and can do rock too. Stop sleeping on them yo!
=
I'm jelly baby 2019 Version yaaay!! Loving it!!
Also, I just can't get enough of Seunghee reactions  her reaction is always so funny, really like when she said I'm jelly Baby and is this Show me The money?! When seeing Jimin's part 
=
Yuna wish she had more light and presence
=
lovelyz: 
mijoo: "that's what i'm talking about!"
omg: /everyone goes wild;
=
Mnet : lets invite middle aged house wifes
Jimin : i am the motherfukin top madam 
Me : this gonna blow
=
yuna is so gorgeous its unreal 
=
Back then I didnt even know the names of AOA Cream members, they were just some random 3 girls (sorry...). And now I'm so hyped watching their performance, chanting their names so hard like Chanmi Hyejeong Yuna hwaiting! Perhaps this show has put them into their 2nd prime time.
=
AOA said they didn’t care if they won they just wanted to perform for their fans ❤️ stan the right group
=
Jimin is such a bad bitch I love her so much omg step on me
=
Can I just ask,,.whos the guy?!
=
The best
=
Sunmi's back up dancer Cha Hyunseung is everywhere
=
And Seolhyun?
=
AOA 
=
If they were still complete they could have showcased AOA Black! Anyways, complete or not, AOA is still relevant.
=
Arteeeeeee
=
Shit Yuna high note live slay me~
=
okay why is this ranked 6th??? i wanna know why
=
Mijoo ah, you're really in the wrong group ~
=
This is probably Solar’s favorite thing ever- and Moonbyul looking knowingly at Solar because she knows how much she loves Puss
=
“Moms will love this” 
=
That's exactly what Jimin wanted. A Rock stage and there she is KILLING IT!!! And she uses her green mic again!! Queendom gave all of them the chance to perform music that they all love.  AOA LET ELVIS SPEECHLESS 4:32 LMAO even the staff gives Jimin the side eye 
=
Aoa theyre the best i love their friendship 
=
Jimin unnie  Jjangg
=
The difference between lovelyz and OMG when Jimi curse is like international fan's reaction and knets'
=
JIMIN ARRGGHH 
=
Jimin gained weight I'm so happy to see her more healthier 
=
I SAW CHA HYUN SEUNG 
=
SEOLHYUN IS FILMING HER DRAMA MY COUNTRY, IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW 
=
Hey, that's Sunmi's hot backup dancer, Cha Hyunseung!!!!! AOA did great again tho! Hwaiting! 
=
0:41 is that Sunmi's dancer?
=
We all need AOA cream comeback
=

=

=
The camera men loves some Chanmi
=
Omg full of real reaction when jimin cursing hahahahaha
=
ICONIC!
=
Where is seolhyun
=
Omg. SEUNGHYUB AND JIMIN
=
How's AOA ranking recently? I was very amazed by their performance for the first two performances and they really deserve to win at least once. They outdid themselves.
=
Yuna's outfit suits her TOO well 
=
What's the name of the girl at 4:38 i love her already
=
Jimin is back to the playground to kill
=

=
AOA  : sexy - yes

This stage is legendary!
=
FNC, I want to have Seunghyub x Jimin collaboration
=
So cute when she shouted Chanmiiiii haha
=
Oh My Girl's reaction to Jimin's curse was so gold  Mijoo was cheering and Solar just singing to Puss 
=
I just wonder why Queendom try make MAMAMOO devil? They even barely show their reactions.
=
Is it jimin’s solo concert?

=
Puss.. 
That's not enough but still blowing my heart ♥ 
Shin Jimin.  She is really good leader and has so much talent ♥ 
But I would like to see she sing
' HEY' instead of the puss.
=
3:19 3:47 4:41 istg seunghee's reaction is on a whole another level
=
Sorry 
But
From Cute to Sexy concept
Our Queens is the best
=

=
AOA Cream are the best era for hyejeong for show her visual
=
GOD JIMIN DIVA.
=
Where's Seolhyun???
=
Why was there one girl missing?
=
Every groups trying not to do a cute concept on Queendom.
AOA Cream: Hold my Jelly 

AOA really tried every concepts for Queendom. From super sexy miniskirt, girl crush Egotistic and here they are nailing Cute concept and Rock/Hiphop. Queens 
=
935
=
AOAAAAA
=
Where is seolhyun 
=
Good but I kinda wish they came together at the end for part of a group song just to end it instead of 2 Jimin solos, idk it feels incomplete and without Seolhyun too but omg loved it! YASSS CREAM PERFORMING AGAIN DKNFLJA;EK
=
Is that dancer is sunmi's dancer too?
=
Jimin killed it!!!!! God jimin diva

=
chanmi's glow was brighter than my future
=
Queendom directors: So AOA what concept/ genre you going with this time?
AOA: Yes
=
After all these killer Queendom performances it's clear that AOA needs to hold a full concert with all their hits remade.
=
Bom was eating and shock at the same time lol is funny
=
I think.... I'm already in love with Jimin... And Hyejeong and Chanmi and Yuna and Seolhyun at the same time. Thanks Queendom for introducing them to me.

Afterall they did their best tho. And I love it so muchhh. 
WE MISS AOA CREAM AND THEY GIVE US AOA CREAM. WHAT ELSE?

=

=
SEUNGHEE CAN I MARRY U
=

=
=
yoooo jimin
=
What was the fan concept given to them??
=
JIMIN POPPING OFF
=
Хочу что-то новенькое увидеть от AOA может что-то тёмное или грустное 
=
We all know that there is a missing “y” 
=
Jimin
=
They have many style song in Queendom. yesss i love it.
=
Kinda wish they did the band playing thing themselves 
=
dangggg ittt Jimin and J.Don unit is backkkkk
=
This show is serioussslyyyy making me fall in love with aoa (♥ω♥*)
=
Can’t believe Solar sang Puss earlier than Jimin in this Queendom 
=
THEY'RE SINGING IM JELLY BABY IN QUEENDOM !
=
ummmm. I am just going to say that their Egotistic stage was wayyyyyyy better then this, it showed what they could really do staging and vocally.
=
Seeing AOA Cream perform after so long made me emotional...
=
yuna highnote ,  im speechless
=
Jimin is the mf tree!!! I love her!
=
i thought that i was watching unpretty rapstar after heard that beepppp
=
OMG
=
YUNA SHINES SO MUCH HERE 
=
Jimin's reminding me once again why she is my bias. Gosh, what a performance. The stage presence was so strong. I wish Jimin and Seunghyub had performed "GOD" though. I just miss Jimin 'N J.Don haha
And AOA Cream did so great as well. I kinda wanted them to do the magical girl theme like in the MV but they slayed anyway.
This just proves once again how talented and diverse AOA is. People seriously need to stop sleeping on them.
=
That split second that you see the lovelz stylist be absolutely shocked at jimins swearing 
=
They bleeped out the word the first 2 times, but then forgot afterwards But anyway, Jimin is amazing
=
T4SA finallyhhh 2019!!! 
=
AOA CREAM FJJFJDJDJD MY HEEEAARRRTTTTT OMG
=
AOA proving to you that they're the whole package.  They all have good voices and great stage presence, now you can see them all as individuals and as a group and that's something I fail to notice before so Queendom has done wonders to showcase that.  Lee Seung Hyub and Jimin stage was really cool maybe they could revive that sub-unit
Oh my girl reactions  you gotta love them
=
Lmao at the Lovelyz room reaction to Jimin cursing. EVEN THE STAFF
=
Yuna is so damn beautiful, she hasn’t changed, if anything she looks younger than ever! And she’s still hitting those notes! You go girls!
=
Bestsong choice ever mad like literally i was so amazed and so cool seeing this the puss version showed so much potential I died
=
Oh I feel like jelly  gotta take a lot of Cream in my coffee now... and JiminLeader hey hey got me toooooo ❤
(I just miss the iconic AOA Cream shoulder dance move )
=
I can't take my eyes of Hyejeong's beauty. She's really beautiful and sexy. And Jimin is that Top Freaking Madam.
=
Queens of the queens, ❤️
=
Wont be top without choa or jimin, see that? Jimin win
=
jimin so damn good... ahhh they are the angel of korea
=
THAT YUNA VOCALS!!
=

=
Queeeeens
=
That in the upper left side means they got third place or they were the number three to present? 
Where is Seolhyum?

Aoa + Seung huyb 
=
there are the winner already! AOA SLAY HARD GUYSS!! 
=
LEGENDS
=
PERFECT
=
Jimin 
=
So anybody still have the guts to say AOA not shine anymore? Just by 3 tasks of Queendom so far you can see their true capabilities.
Imagine if youve known them since 2012. 
=
Lee seunghyup( n flying)
=
Pisa em mim Jimin!!!!!!
=
Yuna is so beautiful
=
Mis hermosas AOA 
=
major AOA Black nostalgia entered the chat
=
AOA CREAM RISE
=
I miss AOA Black
=
Aoa + Jimin Jdon really need to make comeback
=
JIMIN
=
Jimin was like "back to AOA's root", and I LOVE IT!!!
=
i MISS THEM PERFORMING I'M JELLY BABY SO MUCH
=
AOA literally held a concert on Queendom ❤️
=
Yuna: "Be my baby baby"
Me: "IM ALREADY YOURS"
=
AOA cream needs a comeback after this show, they are gaining a lot of attention and new fans!!
=
QUEENS
=
Where is seoulhyun
=
Jimins stage was the best thing ever
=
How about AOA do their debut concept? Where they were a band then be cute then sexy in one performance? That would be lit af
=
Is seolhuyn not part of this show anymore?
=
sunmi dancer join the group chat 0:40
=
Chanmiiii is really shininggg
=
Seunghee is a big fan of Jimin
=
Aoa kill this stage
=
4:04 Nope,Soyeon that ain't N.Flying sunbaenim. That's the rapper J.Don. 
=
QUEENS
=
Can we all agree that AOA is been reborn? *o*
=
Mamamoo got the award
G(idle) got the views
But AOA got the most memorable hair raising stages, presence and my HEART!!
Good Job Ace of Angels!!! 
=
Who's agree this song should released MV ?
⬇️
=
i still can't accept that they didn't win the cover challenge. like hell, their cover of EGOTISTIC deserved that 1st place. periodt.
=
AOA was the biggest dark horse of the show. Before this show everyone thought they were on the brink of disbandment with losing two members and thinking that they were nothing without Choa. Then they defied everyone's expectation and showed us what they're really made of. It's a crime on how severely underrated AOA was during the entire show... they should've placed first at least once. I'm gonna be completely honest and say I'm really sad that they weren't able to win, but in the end being on it was still the best decision they ever made. They did way better than anyone ever expected and because of that, they gained new fans and so much recognition after years of constant ridicule by the public. Before Queendom I knew about AOA and thought their songs were catchy but paid zero attention to them as a group. Now, I'm a full blown stan.
Anticipate their comeback in November!!
=
so can we talk about chanmi's danCe break liek she's the most underrated
=
Who likes AOA?
⬇️
=
Still upset that their egotistic performance did not win first place that whole performance was iconic
=
For those who haven’t watched Queendom - this is what one of the members said that got me really sad and sentimental
When Hyejeong said 
“I want to be on stage. I want to interact with the fans.  I want to act. I want to still do this and that’s why I choose to stay in AOA and FNC” (her company) 

=
geez look at how professional chanmi was when she handled that mic that got loose at dance break
=
Jimin : So, I watched this movie and...
AoA : I hope this one wasn't too crazy
Jimin : To make it simple, we're going to be cowgirls and Chanmi, you're going to do a live combat performance worth Black Widow
AoA : ... OK
=
Chanmi's the hottest, I won't change my mind.
=
AOA still slays, they are the true dark horse of this show  plus chanmi's skills woah! this girls never fails to amaze me
=
The more you listen to the song, the more you’ll fall in love with it. Trust me.
=
AOA in 2019 is better than ever 
=
Chanmi SNAPPED!! FNC needs to start showcase her more. She got talents and they focus so much on Seolhyun that they forget that all AOA members are talented.
=
They were the best to me. They have something no other female group has
=
Yuna literally looks like she's gonna kill anyone (maybe with her beautiful voice? lol), love her so much, AOA was the best!
=
Queendom makes me realise how talented they are
=
When everyone thought they’re done because they disappeared, y’all were trippin’
=
No one: 
Anybody:
AOA: AOA Drop it
Me: ICONIC
=
I really like this song amongst other groups... It's catchy and seductive.
=
Why is this just 2M views. I mean those stunts did by Chanmi are everything.
=
I love AOA, they litterally shine in all performance. Lets support AOA with all our heart they worked hard for it. AOA is always  5 beautiful angels no matter what
=
They should make this their comeback and make an English version
=
My brother is 7 years old, he really loves AOA after he heard "Sorry" when I opened in the kitchen. He especially loves their performance. He listens to this song every day more than me, he wanted them to win on Queendom. I got a new Kpop fan :D <3
=
Queendom introduced me to AOA and I wish I knew about them sooner. I Stan Jimin I love how badass she is and how she raps.
=
YAAAS EVERY PERFORMANCE OF AOA IS UNFORGETTABLE AND HAIR RAISING.
=
AOA REALLY DESERVED A WIN IN THIS SHOW THO THEY SHINED OUT FROM THE FIRST PERFORMANCE-FINAL!!!!!!!!!
=
chanmi's perfermance is amazing, on the fight part her mic fall and she put back it like the pro she is, i watched it so many times and i only saw it now
=
I feel like Yuna hasn't done anything remarkable like Hyejeong's funny scenes or Chanmi's cool dance breaks yet she still keep getting my attention. 
=
I still feel the void left by Mina , but even tho my bias is gone AOA are still my ult group and ill support them to the last day , slay queens slay ... Also chanmis dance thooooo
=
god really make seolhyun the perfect human ever.
=
4:28 Seolhyun ok that tongue ..that's rude..really rude.. i might fall in love with you
=
Wasn’t too familiar with them, but they strait up have the prettiest girls.  This song is great
=
Jimin looks really good with her new hair.
=
In my opinion, AOA is number 1. They have all the aspects and the needed skills and talent, and theyve shown it all throughout each episodes. I just so in love with them! ❤️❤️❤️
=
idk y but i feel sad everytime i see this performance. i think bcoz in previous round they didnt do well and they said (smth like) theyre gonna come up with a better performance and give their all for the final. even tho im not a stan, i wished they couldve experienced being on 1st or 2nd place at some point. i hope they know their final performance was fire
=
Please let's all support them even if they didn't win.
=
I'd say it's not about winning ! That's what AOA always say, It's about them building memories together as a group and enjoying what they like to do, interact with people and amazed us with their performance. I'm a new fan of AOA.
=
I'm just amazed... I really love Chanmi's solo and how professional she solved the problem with her mic. Jimim as always fantastic. Hyejeon showed fantastic vocals. Seolhyun did also an amazing job singing and dancing. And Yuna...  how amazing is it that she moves perfectly and sings like an angle at the same time. Just WOW. Great Job AOA you did it!❤❤
=
Don’t know if anyone noticed, but right after Chanmi’s action dance break, her mic fell off, but ofc she’s so PROFESSIONAL she put it in her back pocket like it was no big deal ❤️ WE STAN PROFESSIONALS
=
This was THE ONE OF THE BEST Stage ever also changmi slayed it
=
I really thought they would die after Choa left ...i`m so glad they showed me wrong ....still alive and kicking more than ever ....
=
every time i watch this i'm just super glad that chanmi was able to get her mic pack back where it belongs after the fight choreo. it makes me nervous watching her try to slip it back in it's place lol
=
AOA was reborn. Watch out for them next year.
=
In this video we can't see well at the end what is written in their back : "To be continued" !!!! But it can be seen perfectly in their "Behind the scenes" of Queendom on their official YT channel ! 
=
this kind of performance is the only thing we want to see in award shows, literally AOA is still the ace
=
Man, it honestly is the best feeling in the world to see that AOA are finally getting the recognition they deserve! They have been my favorite group for 4 years now and it always pained me to see just how underrated they are... It's sad that they didn't get to win but I couldn't be more proud of all the work they put into this competition, they are the queens!!!
=
Omg I didn’t know seolhyun was from aoa I saw her in a Netflix drama
=
You know, I weirdly never like or get appealled by the ones that are super pushed to the throne by their companies, like Jennie of BP, Huynah of 4M, CL, Sohee of WG, Suzy, Soyeon of Gidle, Irine of RV, ect (my personal opinion btw)... so many. In this case, Seolhyun can be said to be most popular in AOA and many would argue she's overrated but in my years of kpop and knowing of AOA when I actually don't care about them, I actually never dislike SH. Can't say I'm a fan either, but I found her to be truly beautiful, body goals, and humble. Now bc of QD, and I only watch a few perf vids, I'm completely mesmerized by her singing voice, something about it just pull my soul. It sounds so calm, relaxed, but so naturally sultry and sexy that's not overdone like other, words literally can't explain. Seriously wish to hear more, but not sure she can carry a solo song since the snippets of her singing with the group left me wanting more so dunno how a full song of only her might be like, but would love to be proven wrong one day if there's a suitable song for her.
=
CAN WE ALL AGREE THAT THIS SONG IS EASY TO LISTEN SONG. THAT EVERYONE CAN JAM ON IT.
=
The girls are having a comeback with come see me
=
Damn that fight scene come through main dancer Chanmi . Me through the whole song. Shook to the core this be called 'Aoa reborn again Queendom' as expected will done girls.
=
i just realized, the camera work for this performance are so good. i guess the camera man stans AOA
=
A VIP here and supporting each and everyone. This performance has been a proof that AOA has been reborn. Good job! 
=
In Queendom AOA's all stage is best. I dont understand why they placed only 4. Actually they should be number 1.
=
AOA ARE YOU KIDDING ME OHMYGOD QUEENS ANYWAYS THIS SONG REMINDS ME OF SELENA GOMEZ THO  OR IDKK
=
This AOA performance has everything rap, dance, visual and voice. 
AOA THE QUEENS OF KPOP!!!
=
4:06 - 4:17 is my fav part ❤
=
"Stop the Love"?
Sorry, Sweetlings. I can't stop loving you.
You're too... wonderful.
=
am I the only one who was waiting for Jimin's "Hey" on this performance? haha
=
The way how Chanmi made it look like the mic falling out during the fight was nothing, WAS AMAZING! Stan AOA
=
I literally cry in the office during office hour, but dude this is AOA. They're capable, they're talented, this is AOA.
=
the girl in 1.02 her freaking husky voice gets me all the dayum time
=
it's my first time listening to this song and all I can say is that it's so catchy 
=
AOA COMEBACK IN NOVEMBER 26th! ❤️
=
AOA have been talented but y'all sleep on any girl group that's feminine ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ❤❤ some of us have been stanning AOA from the start because they have proved over and over again they can pull off any style and genre.
=
Seolhyun reminds me of Poca Hontas
=
queendom showed me Seolhyun have different faces  One on this Video. One on old video 'Good luck '  and mainly that egoistic cover.  Her face is completely different with outfit..
=
a (g)i-dle stan at the start of queendom now also an aoa stan
=
Only respect for chanmi doing black widow’s signature combat move that is no joke it’s really hard 
They all slayed
=
I am a big fan of AOA now after watched this video
=
Seol Hyun is so beautiful... totally fall in love
=
should i start to stan AOA? ohh my god i love it
=
ELVIS! Let's stream Come See Me - AOA and we'll get choreography videos for Sorry and Come See Me. While streaming, ofc let's enjoy the song!  AOA has the best comeback song of 2019 for me.
=
After watching queendom,  'AOA drop it' has stucked in my head!!!! So dope girls!!!! Really impressive!!!!
=
I feel like they came on queendom not to win but to prove a point. I think they wanted to show that they were worthy as a group no matter what the outcome by the end of the show was. They did this for them. I'm so proud.
=
The vocals here are everything ❤️
=
Damn. This is soooo GOOD. why they didnt win?
=
i really like the vocals on this one.
=
Tomorrow's AOA comeback. I'm so excited!!!
=
This stage is incredible, they're so talented, I hope they will have a successful comeback. Cant wait to see them.
=
okay but that dance break was fire
=
thank you AOA for show me the kpop in 2014, now is ur time to shine ❤
=
This performance literally just created their spot in history and I am proud !!
=
And the best performance of the night goes to: AOA!!!!!
=
This was epic....as were so many other performances on the show including Egotistic! 
Honestly I have really mixed feeling about Queendom. 
On the one hand I loved the way all the performers showed real support for each other. I was afraid it was going to turn into Mnet showing out of context clips of the girls diss’ing each other. Try as they might Mnet was not able to ruin or hide the admiration the contestants had for one another. 
On the other hand I really wish people could put their fandom aside and vote for the best performances. Mamamoo brought me to the show as I am a huge fan but if I’m being completely honest I kind of don’t think they should have won. They were good but I really thought, from start to finish, AOA was the best. They were new, different, exciting & totally I unafraid to go all in. Come on, tranvestites?! On Korean TV.! How awesome is that!
I also knew very little about Lovelyz before the show. My basic knowledge was, 1) BabySoul has a great name, 2) there was a scandal involving one of the members when they debuted, & 3) Mijoo is hella sexy! I’ve become a fan because they too went outside of their comfort zone....I mean, Lovelyz covering Sixth Sense?! I would never have guessed that in a million years. That and Yein...her solo dance in the performance stage was stunning! She’s quickly become one of my favorite idols.
I also think it was a little unfair to include sales into the final equation. It gave those groups with larger fan bases a decided advantage. I’d love to know how the outcome would change without sales being included.
Having said all that I thoroughly enjoyed the show.
Edited to say....I actually came here to say that Chanmi is my bias in AOA & has been sinse here Coming Of Age Ceremony stage with Joy & Hayoung! She’s always been so terribly under appreciated in a group that for a few years now has been under appreciated!
=
Im crying like i never been so over whelmed this was so powerful im so proud of u guys❤
=
4:27 Oh my God, seolhyun looks murdered me
=
Wow, I can't stop rewatching this performance for how perfect it was. The song, the outfits, the dance and that freaking stunt double worthy fight scene!!Never seen that done in kpop before, AOA completely stole the show!!!
=
so no one's really gonna talk about how the backup dancers at 4:08 made a FREAKING TREE cuz Jimin ain't a flower she a TREE QUEEN
=
I watched Queendom for Mamamoo but damn, I fell in love with AOA too!! Ahhhhhh!! I love Hyejeong and Chanmi especially ❤
=
This is the best performance ever in queendom, chanmi is lit ❤
=
This song is so cool.It's like an Anthem. AOA are indeed Ace Of Angels. Wish to see them more.
=
This gave me chills. These are the kind of performances I love the most!
=
Never tot AOA will bring song like this. This is lit
=
I am very happy of the return of AOA, they were improving in each presentation. Seolhyun is simply beautiful and the sexiest idol I've seen so far. Jimin spectacular, Chanmi love you, Yuna with his unique voice is the support of the group and Hyejeong you are the love of my life, there is no minute that I don't think only of you ... AOA are the real winners.
=
EU TÔ LITERALMENTE CHORANDO  QUEENS!!!!
ELAS SÃO INCRÍVEIS, MARAVILHOSAS DONAS DA POURA TODA!!!!! AOA RAINHAS!!!
=
Seolhyun voice are so beautifull
=
This version is more cool than official version. I think AOA Sorry need to Re-Recorded.
=
how did they not win?! i know mamamoo's performance was really good too, but i feel like aoa deserved at the very least 2nd place
=
4:17 that's hot
=
Queen of performances 
=
I missed AOA so much  I’m so happy for them
=
CHANMI LOOKS SO GOOOOOOOOODD!!!!



ANYONE AGREE?
=
my god seolhyun's voice is so charming and it was only until queendom that i finally realise that ;(
=
One of my favorites!! This is so good!! I wish they were like this every time! This is what suit them!!
=
4:28 I can't 
=
I wanna see their Sorry MV sooooonnnn ❤❤❤❤❤ I can't forget how the rest of AOA praised Chanmi's performance during Six Puzzles, their love for each other ❤
=
I come back everyday to this performance to appreciate Chanmi's fight scene, she's such a superwoman
=
I love the jimin's 2nd rap in the performance . Why is this part not in the song?!
=
ANGELS They are Amazing at Everything they do..and They have been proving this Since Very long..weather they were 7,6 or 5(now)..HWAITING FOR THE COMEBACK....❤
=
Reminds me of Mamacita, Cause if the cowboy theme sort of haha
=
COME SEE THEIR COEMBACK ‘COME SEE ME’!!! LET US SUPPORT OUR ANGELS, ELVIS’s!!!!
=
THIS MAKES ME LOVE MY ANGELS MORE! YOU DID A GREAT JOB AOA! THANKS FOR DOING YOUR BEST FOR US ELVIS! WE LOVE YOU ALWAYS!!! <3 FOR ELVIS, RANKING DON'T MATTER. WE ARE ALWAYS HERE TO SUPPORT YOU!
=
Aoa was so cool during the entire show ! I’m excited for their comeback 
=
AOA LEGENDARY GIRL GROUP
=
I’ve been an AOA for a few years, they were actually my first group and the ones that got me into loving Kpop and to see them get so much more recognition makes me so happy. They lost 2 members yet we’re still able to continue when everyone else thought they would disband. I love you AOA! I owe so much to you 
=
Moonbyul: "Chanmi is our favorite" 
Me a moomoo: yes.
=
LOL PERFECT SHOW, WHO LOVES AOA ??????
=
AOA deserve QueenDom so much 
=
Great performance.
They all shined and that's what I'm loving right now of AOA, they're a group that you can see that each of them can add a different flavor. They all have their momentum and are able to show their skills
=
Came here right after their comeback
=
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT CHANMI GIRL CAN SPLIT U IN HALF 
=
4:29 Seolhuyn is so gorgeous u killed me girl❤️
=
wow.. i'm so amaze with the performance
also good song
=
Such a cool stage and song! 
=
AOA really gave us a lot of great performances on Queendom. 
Can wait for their comeback!
=
Now *THIS* is the type of music I Love 
=
this performance is just WOW
=
Seolhyun is so beautiful. All of them ❤️
=
I met AOA through “Queendom” and became a fan. I already knew the group about hearing because I watched "unpretty rapstar" and Jimin was one of the participants, but I was only interested in looking for more about the group after the program. I'm a sorry person for not giving them a chance before.
=
I'm so happy that i got to learn about AOA here. Actually i always knew them but never felt interested enough to check their songs (except for Miniskirt). I loveeeeee them now. ❤️❤️❤️
=
Watching this again and again
=
Hyejeong's hat at 1:38 somehow actually sets up the perfect ending shot at 5:20.
=
I only followed their song(only some of them) because their songs are catchy.
But after Queendom I became a fan like kind of fans that would watch every shows they are on.
I knew they are talented but their personality are also amazing and not what I imagined they would be.
Yuna is so mother like. I fell for her after she re-made the kimchi soup
Jimin is so funny, I fell for her after "I'm the tree" and when she sID "WHY" after Mamamoo pick AOA during second round.
Chanmi is so seductive like.. I fell for her dance break during Miniskirt.
Seolhyun; I only know about her being one of the beautiful visual but here she works so hard to even with her busy shedule she still perform very well with her group and didn't do it half-assed also her voice is so unique.
Hyejeong is so funny. I fell for her when she was a dancing black hole on first challenge and then the lemon challenge.
So basically, I'm a fan.
=
girls look like they just came out of  magazine cover came to life . girls look amazing  and sound amazing . be cool stay cool
=
I want to see the other 3 members watching them in this new concept which suit them sooo much. I miss them all!!
=
3:17 ~ OMG! ❤
=
can i just say chanmi looked so damn cool during that dance? break and all the girls *mwuah* flawless
=
this song is my favorite!! :D
=
Waaa they really deserve more, this queens are really amazing ❤️
=
I WANT AOA MAKE THIS SONG TO A MV!!! SERIOUSLY!! I AM NOT A FAN. BUT I WILL TELL YOU GUYS THIS SONG DESERVES A MV.  OMGG I WILL NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS THOUGHT!!!
=
Wow their dance is smooth..
=
I’m happy AOA is probably reviving their popularity thanks to this show. I don’t think it can ever be what it used to be but they deserve success still. I look forward to their comeback!
=
AOA !!!!! Even though they don't win, but this show just proves that they're alive and even better <3
=
GO STREAM COME SEE ME
=
I wish I could like this performance 1000 times
=
Perfeição!! 
Impecável
0 defeitos.
Esse é o AOA 
=
I really proud of them, people don't believe in them anymore after 2 members left but they proof how strong they're
=
Im in love with Jimin's makeup and haircolor. It compliments her so much
=
Oh sheeeeet 3:20 & JIMIN: AOA Drop it 3:45 omg, so coool & beautiful 
I'm ready to look at this masterpiece forever
=
AOA going to be around for along time . girls just a great group. girls keep putting out great song like this .girls going to stay around for a long time.girls have proved they are top group time and time again.over years they have grown in to a great group.LOVE YOU GIRLS  STAY COOL BE COOL
=
QUEEN CHANMI!!!!!!
=
The stage is amazing
=
That Black Widow fighting style by Chanmi was 
=
wowowowowowow i really fell for AOA during Queendom! I look forward to seeing their new releases now!
=
i'm sure this is should be their comeback song,,,
=
For me AOA is the Champions! You've proved yourselves well! ❤
=
Im dying for their comeback.
=
I'm proud of my ladies. Even though they didn't win their mic drop performance of Mamamoo's Egotistic was the highlight of the show and Miniskirt wasn't far behind.
=
Thank you for the reactions  (I loved Queendom)
(AOA made us Laugh), (Park Bom made us cry), (Lovelyz was Lovey), (Oh My Girl 'Concept' Queens or cry babies?), (Mamamoo being Mamamoo), & {(G)I-DLE can remix any song 1,000 times and still sound Awesome!}
=
3:22 can we just appreciate what's going on here, damn it surprises me when she does the spin at the end
=
AOA deserved better, but the sheer amount of new fans is making me super happy, regardless of what their rankings were in this show. stream their comeback everyone~!
=
I like AOA because of Jimin in Unpretty Rapstar and then I fall in love with members 
=
Among all queendom contenders. I am most curious with AOA
=
They're really professionals
=
My favorite group on Queendom
=
AOA ❤️ Chanmi y Yuna ❤️ Me encantó la canción y la coreografía ❤️
=
Great song, great perfomance, I will always be a fan of everyone in AOA cause all of his music and comebacks were great and in this competition they were so funny and real <3 <3 <3 really underrated but like jimin say you need to make your way to the top
=
I like this song!!!
AOA!!!
I LOVE THEM!!!
=
Out of all the Queendom's songs, for some reason Sorry holds a special place in my heart. Just the first 'oooh' part is killing me out of mystery... The rest is just bomb
=
AOA para sempre ♡♥♡ amooo eterno
=
I just cant effin wait for the major comeback and their MVs! My gosh, please AOA, make it happen! ❤️❤️❤️
=
Chanmi omg!!! Pulling stunt all of sudden!! ❤️ That surprise me haha
=
Besides how insanely amazing this performance is the song is a complete bop I’m so ready for a comeback
=
This song has been stuck in my head for a long time and it just reminds me that AOA is here to stay and JUST DID THAT
=
3:35 Sick!!
=
Everyone in 2018: AOA will disband in 2019
AOA in 2019: I'm not done yet, sorry sorry sorry sorry.
Edit: Thanks for 1k likes. Jokes aside, we should really praise them for this. When everyone but them lost their hope, they renewed their contract. They didn't give up. They are so brave and now the fortune favors them once again. I love AOA so much. Hope we all will support their comeback at November. Never forget "no matter where you go, the pretty girls are AOA"
=
3:12  alan walker 
=
3:35 - BISH FREAKING FLEWWWWW. CHANMI <3 <3
=
My favorite. Their song is the best from the final performances. imo the top 2 should’ve gone to AOA & GIDLE.
=
im here because of the viral clip on 4:28 yall... she makes me very very gay
=
i mean can we talk about how professional chanmi is when her mic almost dropped?!
=
I AM OVERWHELMED
=
Jimin would really benefit from a deep conditioning treatment in her hair 
=
Don't forget to stream Come see me on both FNC and 1theK channel !
=
Damn I miss my queens!, 
=
4:28 Seolhyun just impregnated me
=
Heart melted when seolhyun singing and more lines in song
=
This is the AOA I know !!!!♥️
=
Can we talk about Chanmi killing part???? It was so damn cool
=
Chanmi pulled the fight scene in live tv without a single hair out place. I think we can all agree, this is girl is epic.
=
This is gold I kept coming back
=
WOW!!!!  What a great performance!!!!
This is why I love AOA!!
I love u guys!! So great!
u guys deserve much more
=
Guys, STAN AOA ASAP. THEY HAVE TALENT.
bye
=
For Me AoA win ever AoA and Oh My Girl
=
Ok, out of all the groups I've been following throughout Queendom, AOA had my favorite new comeback for the final round. I'm so glad they're not disbanding despite the tough times as of late. AOA FIGHTING!!!
=
Honestly when it comes to great dance break I'd give it to AOA. The build before the final chorus is just out of this world. They did it with Miniskirt in the first round and they take it to just another level with those fighting stunts on this final stage and the dance break right after is just wild and cool.
After watching through every other performances again, it actually felt like Miniskirt has become a wake up call to other groups and everyone kind of stepping up their game in the second round. AOA is a true legend they needs more credits for how good they are.
=
Maybe their third performance was a little messy, but how can anyone deny that AOA didn't show their versatility and charisma on stage in every single damn performance? Honestly the fact that they ended 5th place when AT THE VERY LEAST they should've placed 2nd? I came to the show fully expecting to support Lovelyz, and while I still do, AOA completely wrecked me in every performance. They definitely placed 1st in my heart
=
Jimin lookin like Tove Lo..
Girl made me Shook & Choked to my own saliva
=
Seolhyun 
=
voltando aqui diariamente até o comeback das minhas meninas saírem
=
How much we love all of them
=
Can someone make the full audio with this version ❤❤❤
=
Chanmi - what a girl
=
THIS IS AOA THESE GIRLS WITH MUCH TALENT
=
Played this many times already. I love everything about it. :D
=
Jimin always know how to says word *AOA* with really catchy ways.. 
*AOA drop it* *this is AOA*
=
4:25 GURL IM GAY STOP IT OMGGG
=
Aoa is so amazing. I wanted to see them flourish more! People of Korea, please support this group. How I wish I could buy their future albums here in the UK
=
can’t wait for AOA comeback!!!
=
I need this mv!!!!!!!
=
I have missed them so much 
=
Jimins so pretttty
=
SEOLHYUN 
=
Chanmi deserves this dance break that FNC had owed her for 7 years.
=
やっぱAOAが一番や

⬇️
=
I' m addicted to this song
=
Wow. What a performance! All I have to say is AoA definitely needs to make a new album that has this grown up sound and get away from their original sound.  Proud of these girls ❤️
=
This song is so good. Deserves more love
=
CHANMI KILLED THAT STAGE !!!!
=
I'm waiting for the mv
=
WAITING FOR AOA COMEBACK
=

This performance better make it onto some "shook kpop moments" video 
=
Arrrrr I’m in love with them~~~ helpppppp

=
love this AOA very much!
=
So addicted to the song omfg
=
I got into k-pop thanks to AOA.
It's great to see the sexy queens of 3rd generation proving their worth once again in the present days.
I'm not an emotional guy but AOA's presence in Queendom have me in tears.
=
We playing Red dead redemption 2
=
This has a western vibe. 
=
They deserve win
=
EVERYONE WENT CRAZY AFTER JIMIN SAID “AOA DROP IT”
=
Perfection!!
=
Jimin wrecked my bias list 
=
AOA has always been a concept idol, so the concept has always been the best.  This concept is also wonderful.  The western concept further increased the brightness.
=
AOA become one of my favorite groups on the show even surpassing the groups i already loved on there, imma have to stan!! they’re winners in my eyes
=

=
Queen Chanmi everybody.
=
Realmente necesito el video musical de esta canción
#AOA Queens 
=
After one month, still make me cry, too good
=
I love Jimin's part. When she said b o o s h  I felt that.
=
La canción es increíble 
=
Chanmi’s fighting scene & Seolhyun’s vocal 
=
最後一集queendom中我最喜歡的一首歌
=
That action is A+! Chanmi is so effin awesome!
=
Damn, this is too good
=
Minhas rainhas iti ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
My AOA!!!!! Love you ladies!!!
=
Chanmi effing slayed! AOA is my winner!
=
Hey there's a part that not in the audio
=
❤❤❤❤❤
 *AOA* 
❤❤❤❤❤
=
I'm stanning the right group
=
CHAN MI'S fight scene blew me away.
=
4:28 O.O whut.
=
I keep rewatching this video because it is just so good to see and hear them perform again. They all did exceptional but I think it is Yuna's parts in the song that are my favorite. I just love how powerful she sings.
=
THEY'RE BACK BBY!!!!! <33333
=
SEOLHYUN TE AMOOOOO
=
AOA❤
=
Wow! AOA real is the best group in this show.
=
Chanmi:  "So, you didn't vote for me as best dancer?  I see."
=
I like to hearing jimin rap
=
The ace of queendom.  U guys still win in our heart 
=
I love the other Queendom groups too, but, Sorry... this was the best of the Finals Performances. Supporting AOA forever. 
=
gah they have such an easy swag about them i love it
=
Its time to wake up y'all!!
=
UNNIE THIS IS SO LEGIT OMG, I LOVE YOU!!!
=
I love kpop songs this style. The makeup, hairstyles, clothes, vocals 
=
AOA是女神٩(˃̶͈̀௰˂̶͈́)و
=
Been 7 years in the industry yet still competitive ✨
=
0:41 remind me of planet coaster song
=
This song is so good!
=
When AoA meet RdR2
=
what a legend
=
It's sad how they just end up in 4th place
=
Underrated tbh i like this song.
=
watch it several times
=
i already fall in love with jimin rap. can i stan them?
=
AOA IS LEGENDARY
=
Love the melody
=
MNet please bring all the queendom concept on MAMA
=
The best
I love this.
Success siss!
X O X O from Argentina

When seolhyun said we are going to outshine other groups she didn't lie ..
To other fandoms : seolyun didn't really mean  that she was kidding dont get her wrong 
=
AOA begin again!
=
I guess if they changed the visual concept for something like the visual of Something from Girls Day with a similar sexy dress, it would have been more iconic. The cowboy concept doesn't match for me with the song. Still, Im so proud of them :')
=
I want a music video for thiiisss song!!!
=
Wow that dance break
=
I have watched this so many times
=
WOW WHAT A PERFORMANCE. WOW CLAP CLAP CLAPPPPPP! DEABAK!!
=
Jimin: AOA Drop It
Me: Wig dropped, destroyed, decimated
=
Yuna looks more and more beautiful
=
chanmi
=
AOA ! Drop it .... ❤❤❤❤❤
=
WOW! IM SPEACHLEES THEY ARE AOA SUPER POWERFULL! IM SO HAPPY
=
Great sound,I love this song
=
Waiting the mv
=
Seolhyun looks tired. I'm worried
=
*STAB THE STAB THE LOVE STAB THE STAB THE*
=
I love it...
=
this is my favourite song and performance no doubt :)
=
This music is just my taste ughhhhhh
=
Say what you want about the korean pop scene, but on the choregraphy complexity and the dancing execution, AOA is on another level.
=
I need the music vid for this song to drop now!!!!
=
AOA is a proof that you don't need less clothing to look sexy
=
Wahhh im in love 
=
Oops, Jimin blond ;-)
=
Let's get 2M today guysss
=
Brooo the girl in red hair the thing she did with the guy was like how Natasha from avengers would do 
R.E.S.P.E.C.T
Edit: wow so many likes...thank you for that 
=
i really like this so much❤️
=
Among all the beautiful idols on this program... seolhyun is just on another level by herself. Can’t wait for her to be casted as marvel’s answer to Wonder Woman... or at the very least there’s gotta be a Korean version of Xena starting seolhyun  (and no, I’m not taking away from the spectacular action sequence chamni did)
=
aoa should've won...
=
They're back and they're awsome!!!!
=
These girls are still going strong! I love them, they’re working so hard. This performance was amazing! The concept, their vocals are still killing it, the dance was great, their presence was so powerful. That fight and the stunts, plus that dance break AND Jimin’s rap??? They have my full support
=
So we all agree that Queendom was basically Chanmi showing why she's THE main dancer in AOA and deserves more love, right?
=
After Queendom they gain a new fan!
=
WTH CHANMI!!!!!!
=
CHANMI TOTALLY SLAYED.  I'M SHOOOOOK!!! AOA DROP IT!
=
Por algo es mi grupo favorito!!!!
Esoero sea muy apoyado.
Urge nuevo material.
AOA drop it !
=
I miss you so much AOA. I wanna cry when I see this show because I love you so much and miss you so much. my angels  fly high because you are perfect. you went  the best in this queendom.
=
Proud of our queens at QUEENDOM.
Proud to be an Elvis since 2012. Now I'm waiting for their comeback.
=
The fact that the hat dropped in the perfect spot for their pose in the end is iconic
=
this is the very first time i have ever been grateful for a tv show without queendom i bet  AOA would ever show how truly amazing artists and performers they are. chanmi’s solo stage alone deserves a daesang let alone the whole performance
=
AOA DROP IT 
=
COMEBACK WITH THIS WOULD BE DEM BOMB
=
Love thissss
=
AOA is amazing a song!
=
Go girls! Amazing cowgirls.
=
This doesnt sound like a k-song. Dont get me wrong, i love kmusic however this performance sounded like a new era. ❤️
=
I can't believe I never watched this until NOW
=
A new fan here to  celebrate the Renaissance of AOA
!  They are still sexy & elegant even in cowboy's suit!  Love the 5 angels so much!
=
SORRY BUT THIS IS LEGENDARY.
=
久しぶりに見たけど路線が
大分変わったんやな！
チョアが居なくなったのか…
=
Iconic, never seen before. QUEENS
=
3:22 we need more of this in gg, this is power, i suddenly feel proud beeing a women :'D  I mean, i never saw a move like 3:35 in a gg performance ( tell me if there i something like this ), and i never knew i needed it. I guess thats the visual of "step on me pls" i guess? xD 
I love all the final stages thats so nice
=
CHANMI I AM PROUD OF YOU BABY
=
This is different from their other stuff
I highly prefer this version of them honestly.
=
Why no comeback yet? What are you waiting for FNC???
=
MY QUEENS ❤️
=
Hairs standing at the end
=
AOA Drop it 3:45
=
I'm totally fan of this Queens
=
AoA Drop it 
=
The west never look so dangerously beautiful. I need seolhyun fan cam please wow.
=
Queendom was Chanmi’s show in every single episode, no one can change my mind
=
Las mejores 
=
Can't wait for AOA's comeback in November
=
AOA IS QUEENS
=
How did AOA not get at least final 2?
=
FNC PLEASE MAKE ENGLISHVERSION PLS I WANT ITTTTTTTTT
=
LEGEND
=
This is SOOOOOOO coooool
=
AOA bringing new charm to their game!
=
it seems like seolhyun wants to kill me with her charisma :) well im gay now
=
semenjak queendom jd ngefans bgt sama AOA,apalagi chanmi
=
that "AOA DROP IT" wAS THAT THING, I'M CRYING.
=
AOA THE BEST
=
Seolhyun is not playing when she said she's afraid their performance will outshine others. 
The best performance ever!
Good song, good voice, good visuals. Our angels 
=
Was this epic or what!?
=
Major Ariana Grande feels mixed with David Guetta
But wow i love the increase in intensity oooof
=
AOA BRINGING BACK THEIR GLORY AS QUEENS!!!!!
=
Every time i listen and watch the perform of this song i feel the thrill , the passion , and the emotions behind each notes keep it Up AOA , FIGHTING Saranghee
=
I can't get over how professional Chanmi recovered from losing her equipment during the stunts, just in time for the dance break. PROFESSIONALS!!!!!!
=
want this for studio version...better and nice with new jimin rap and arrangement of the song
=
all the rankings where just plain disrespectful
=
I love AOA so much. During their hiatus I was worried and really wished for an album. They didn't win, but I'm so glad they were able to perform again and try new things, so happy that they could once again establish themselves as a group and release a new song. I hope they release an album soon!
=
I can watch this 7000000 times
=
is this for the upcoming red dead redemption  PC
=
Yuna strong and solid vocal. Very Pleasant to the ear
=
im so gay for them
=
เพลงเพาะจัง​
=
Chanmi 
=
XD XD XD AOAA
=
❤
=
Stop! I got goosebumps!!
=
How about mv???❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
Jimin: we are the first performer for the final round
Seolhyun: i think we have a problem
Yuna, chanmi, hyejeong and Jimin 
Seolhyun: what if we outshined the other Groups 

Hahahhhah  i can see why she's so confident hahahahah
=
The lyrics have deep mean
=
I love them so much
=
OMG THAT DANCE BREAK
=
Aoa are just now getting a sliver of the attention they deserve tbh, I want them to be invited to the big events everybody else is at, I just want them to have more opportunities as a group again. Anyways I’m so happy for them I hope they feel so pleased with their queendom era they literally made history YET AGAIN.
=
Good job cameraman 
=
*AOA DROP IT*
=
I notice AOA cause this program
=
This song won me over more than the rest it's so catchy and its amazing
=
I hope they win tbh. But it's okay they're still the winner for me. They really slayed this stage, my 2nd fav after Egoistic. All did a great job here but Chammi is literally mind blowing, still can't get over her  part. Also Seolhyun's vocal & her stage presence is killin me. Jimin's rap is amazing as always. Now i am anticipating to their cb this November. AOA fighting!
=
AOA best performance imo
=
AOA just gets better and better..... no stopping for these QUEENS.
=
Thank god they aren’t disbanding
=
YES YES YES WUIDKAKDKMWKDKKAKZIAOOSKAKSMS BTICHUAIZIAOZOOKSAKOSOA
=
Proud Elvis here!!!! 
=
Chanmi just did a Hurricarana, axel kick and roundhouse kick. Wrestling Queen 
=
❤❤
=
THIS IS WHAT THEY NEEDED!!!!! A MATURE FREAKING SOUND!!!!!!!!! UGH KEEP THEM WITH THIS!!!!!
=
Everything was on point
=
I miss Choa :')
=
I'm a moomoo but this my fav performance lol
=
Maybe this is what AOA needed all along. A simple and matured sound that fits their image.
=
JIMIN: AOA DROP IT
CHANMI: .. DROPPED HER MIC AND HANDLED IT FLAWLESSLY.
=
PEOPLE DONT SLEEP ON AOA PLZ SUPPORT THEIR COMEBACK ✨
=
AOA !! The best !!!❤️❤️
=
This is soo EPIC like epiicccc!!!!! Damn can't stop to praise this performance
=
This is my fave song out of all of the final songs and my 2nd favourite performance next to Lion. Think they all won this competition ❤️
=
I think I'm a fan now hehehe
=
So awesome please AOA comeback, Im always Support you are:)
=
5:20 Did they put the hat there on purpose? 
=
I don’t know if their comeback can top this!!! Like wow, this is so good!!
=
I don't know but I'm crying.. I love you angels..
=
Good Job Girlssss
=

=
Hijas de su ching*da mae vienen con todo <3

=
สุดยอดของโชว์ยกให้​ AOA
=
Love from VietNam
=
2019
=
CHANMI!!!!
=
a comeback is required
=
... whoa 
=
SOMEONE PLEASE  TELL ME WHO THESE STUNNING COWGIRLS ARE!!!!
=
temend a las jefas del pueblo temer a la old school una coreografia de accion increible
=
This is different than most of their recent songs, which is nice. 
What's up with their make up though? They look weird LMAO
=
The rapper tho
=
Im sorry but this is such a good song! Wow! 
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Who's here after Come see me? 
Go stream the M/V now!
=
AOA me impresionó en todo el programa, cada presentación era tan única y    me  dejaron sin aire.
=
❤️
=
I’m a moomoo but as I watched queendom I must say I should stan AOA also. ❤️
=
This is really THE BEST PERFORMANCE from them ever in Queendom!! And Chanmi snapped it so hard during the dance break 
=
Please support their comeback tomorrow
=
This needs a music video in a beach
=
Wow!!! 
=
aoa still the best as always
=
so amazing
=
can't stop watching this
=
I was wondering with the Korean taste, this is really good. Why this performing is not winning the champions
=
除了绝了我还能说什么 太牛逼了吧！！！
=
I love this
=
Chanmi slays the fight scene 
Seoulhyun sticking her tongue out nearly killed me
=
I JUST GOT GOOSEBUMPS
=
I'm officially chanmi biased.
=
Amazing
=
Ellas lo hicieron bien^_^
=
The song is so good 
=
I don't care who is the winner, Just AOA is the best here. The song is very very good
=
Omg me love
=
FNC 可以麻煩你們把這首也拍成MV嗎～
AOAㄧ整年沒回歸，好不容易節目把AOA的魅力讓大家看見，好好把握一下這股熱潮，把AOA再帶起來，年底的回歸一定也會有幫助！
我是一個一路看AOA成長的Elvis,每張專輯都有買，主打歌也都會唱跳，真的是有花心力追的團，希望不要就這樣默默消失，FNC給我好好做！
=
the real winner
=
so is the final stage are songs they write/produce themselves?
=
HOW IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT YUNA?? SHE SLAYED THIS PERFORMANCE!  SHE'S SO PRETTY!!!!
=
Final comeback means this is their last ever song?! Noooo
=
serius nanya ini ga akan dibikin mv gtu???????? :((((( enakkk beud lagunyaaaaa
=
They are queens regardless of not winning the competition
=
3:13 CHANMI DID THAT
3:47 AOA DANCE BREAK
4:07 JIMIN'S RAP ON FIRE
4:16 SEOLHYUN SWEET VOICE

too much for my heart T.T
=
AoA said “yeehaw”
=
y'all support aoa's upcoming comeback
=
AOA Ace of Angels, thank you so much for bringing this spectacular stage for us.We truly appreciate your effort in breaking walls, stepping out of the comfort zone and conquering the reformation of the group. You girls r number 1 to us.
=
ahhh the shivers im getting from this
their voices are so fricking smooth and just ahh this kind of mature concept definitely fits them
and omg their dance breaks as well as that action scene? amazing
damnn
=
My girl Chanmi OMGGG her singing improved sooo much. Also living for Jimins hair♥️
=
UGHHGHAK this is getting me so excited for their november comeback I CAN'T WAIT
=
BRAVO CHANMI!!!!! THE BEST 
=
THIS STAGE IS EVERYTHING!!! GURLS U ARE KILLIN IT!!
=
wow THAT WAS AMAZING
=
excuse me i need to go talk with merriam-webster because there are CURRENTLY NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE LEVEL THIS IS ON!!
=
best yeehaw girls <3
=
This was the best song... I want a Mv AoA pleaaaae
=
They are so beautiful and talented. This song is so good. I wish them the best <3
=
This song  and performance deserved more recognition!!! Its so lit!!!! 
=
they need to release a video.... I feel like G-IDLE company is one utilizing all this free promotion to their utmost
=
This is what we needed and what AOA needed cause they have never been this powerful and I never knew they COULD be this powerful
=
AOA, fighting!
=
Jimin is so beautiful 
=
If we were to talk about the wild wild west I could see...
Seolhyun as 
Jimin as 
Yuna as 
Chanmi as 
Hyejeong as
=
AOA straight #QUEENS 
=
Ok but did you all notice how thiccc they look. Those curves are slaying
=
Wow !!! They make me think them again.
=
Yall see what seolhyun did at 4:28 ???
=
We need QUEENDOM Season 2
EXID
Gfriend
Weki Meki
Gugudan
(hoping for them to join) ❤️
=
when AOA first entered Queendom, everyone thought they were a weak group. Also only Seolhyun and Jimin were the well-known ones. Now at the end of this contest, its amazing to see that the public has something else to talk about AOA apart from the former member's departure. They are talented and beautiful. They are women-empowering and pacifistic. Jimin 'the tree' is the idea bank of the group. Chanmi is an incredible dancer and has a caring personality. HyeJeong 'General Lemon' is a killer combination of model-visual, humor and vocals. Yuna is such a gentle lady who can cook (and sing well, of course). And Seolhyun is not just about visuals, her voice is a blessing. Not an Elvis but I'm proud of them for bringing their best throughout the show, and genuinely happy that they are regaining the recognition they deserve. 
Will be looking forward to their next comeback - Seolhyun revealed a bit of it on her IG and seems like they're gonna wear some fancy suits this time. Cant wait!
=
I really like this song. It has hollywood vibe.
=
Yup, another bop. 

*Downloads song*
=
I hate how much I love AOA and how underrated they are  Just... just look at these queens. So resilient and fierce despite everything. AOA fighting!!!
=
3:55 có bà dancer múa quạtt
=
So are we gonna talk about how much better they are as a 5 member group? For each member to SHINE individually and together is BEYOND AMAZING.
=
Ai sinceramente? Vcs são perfeitas
=
JIMIN TAGLINES
JIMIN' HEY HEY HEY
NEXT
JIMIN: BRAVE SOUND
NEXT
JIMIN: AOA DROP IT
FEEL ME?
=
I need a official music video for this.
Who is agree with me?
=
This makes me want to stan hard. I mean, they did so well during Queedom !!
=
I don’t know who this girls are . But I love the performance!!!!
=
太棒啦，A团重生，看到潔美很拼命被感动的五体投地
=
i hope they do sistar concept
=
Please don’t sleep on themmm
=
Masih tak pantengin 
=
I am not stan gg but I have become very fond of Queendom girls. And AOA has impressed me since the first episode. AOA fighting! 
=
Mv comeback now
=
AOA are acclaimed divas, no matter what the result, they are still queendom queens! ❤️
=
I think if Jimin will has become a leader of AoA it will be prefectly isn't she?
=
Very good :)
=
Chanmi really did that and it has yet to go viral??? Can we make it go viral??
=
Destiny by Mamamoo and Sorry by AOA is I think the best song released. Destiny and Sorry sound like a song that I have heard in English but I did not, I don't know to explain it properly but it is something that I think I would understand in my language even if it's in korean.
=
great song and an even better performance
=
Really want to watch this perfomance on MAMA, yeah.. but... ¿
=
I want choa in here
=
0:34
=
10/10 hurricanrana
=
this was the 2nd best performance in Queendom after egoistic
=
THIS IS AMAZING AOA!!!!! OMG IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE, GIRL GROUPS ARE THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN TO KPOP.
=
CHANMI OMG!!!! SO INCREDIBLE!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ The best part, iconic part, ledendary part!!!! Fighting AOA, Get your full potential!!!
=
This song is absolute bomb! I'm deffo a fan after Queendom 
=
can I have other queendom group reaction to this performance 
=
AOA, G-IDLE AND OMG ARE THE BEST STAGES EVER. BUT ALL 6 GIRL GROUPS HAS THE BEST PERFORMANCES! 
=
Oh my..... even just listening song before chanmi’s part, I already loving the concept, makeup, costume, dancers! Until chanmi’s part, I’M SO WOWWWWWWWW
i just fall in love to AOA AGAIN!!!
WELL DONE GIRL!!!!! You girls had my vote!!!
=
Thank you Queendom for making me a huge fan of AOA now
=
These girls are just badasses! I love this concepts
=
Watching this made me realized..I miss AOA so much..
=
que que isso em, foda dms 
=
I can't stop watching the fight scene it's just so good!!
=
omg this is amazing
=
3:34 god i wish that were me
=
Everythings so good ❤️
=
This was the best performance amazing AOA~!!!
=
I love this AOA drop it 
=
Wow! I love everything about this song and their performance. Great job AOA!!! 
=
Never regret stanning AOA still slay like always
=
IDK I JUST LOVE THIS PERFORMANCE SO MUCH. THIS IS WHAT AOA NEEDS. THE CONCEPT THAT AOA NEEDS.
=
I WISH AOA WON!!! ❤️
=
As a MooMoo, I have to say that AOA really deserved to win Queendom. I loved Mamamoo’s performance, but AOA have really found an amazing concept for themselves through this show and I’m here for their talent.
=
So does this signal the end of the Bingle Bangle era?
=
this show really did wonders for AOA they really showcased what they are capable of and this final stage is just WOW really absolutely magnificent job
=
Damn! Oh hell yeah! Applause!!!
=
Pasión de gavilanes eeh~~~
=
Seolhyunnn smirk so hot
=
Jimin look like Lisa
=
3:22 rom pom pom pom pom rom pom pom pom man down
=
Love this song a lot
=
AOA deserves the best apraisal. They have their own style and can make auidences immersed in their style. They have left a remarkable mark in Kpop history.
You are the best.
=
GENTE, O QUE FOI ISSO PELO AMOR DE DEUS? 
=
Love this song 
=
Sorry is such as an amazing song. I really wanna see Aoa's comeback with a song like Sorry!
=
Chanmi getting her limelight is the best.
=
Is this their own song?? Or just a cover? Omg Seolhyun!!! ❤
=
Intro was killing me..
=
They didn’t win the competition but they achieved so many feats by simply competing alone. They won (back) the hearts of the public and they regained the attention that S.Kor gave them an abundance of years before.
=
I will love if AOA continue this concept and music
=
Lie lie = hip hip ❤️
=
Great performance   from.AoA love it
=
Wowwww that live action 
=
*_They were dressed up as Cowgirls I volunteer as the horse _*
=
You know some shit is about to go down when Jimin says "AOA DROP IT"
=
is it just me but seolhyun giving me Pocahontas vibes
=
Win or lose AOA regain their throne again.
Edit: sorry is now my fav song
=
I didn't expect a cowgirl/wild west concept hearing the song beforehand
=
This is one of the catchiest songs of 2019.
=
4:26
=
=
Those who says AOA has lost its touch?
Hips never lie, boyz. Hips never lie.
AOA Drop It!
=
pERFEITAAAAAS PORRA MELHORES PERFORMANCES DO PROGRAMAAAAAA. ansiosa pelo comeback
=
Just wow... AOA the best..
=
There's too many iconic moments. From Chanmi's choreographed fighting scene to Jimin's rap to Hyejeong's stare to Yuna's vocals to Seolhyun's out-of-this-world visuals. 
Even with 5 of them, nothing's really missing — though I miss Choa and Mina a lot. But with 5 of them, they're stronger than ever, and you can feel their eagerness to perform once again on the stage.
This is such a majestic performance. They really came back HARD.
=
Seoulhyun looks like Pocahontas...
=
I never really noticed chanmi IN AOA  before queendom i always knew she was their main dancer but she exceeded my expectations.
=
AOA BETTER THAN "THE WINNER"
=
Omg really hope to see more of them after thisssss..!! How can everything be so chill but so cool and swag at the same timeeee. Omgggg..!!
=
再次驚豔的AOA。太好看了❤❤❤
=
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL  if there would be an english version that would be dope because the chorus sounds like the trendy edm music nowadays
=
Jimin is on
=
Seriously this is a bop, Like wow
=
A-O-A DROP IT!
=
YOU ARE NO.1 IN MY HEART GIRLSSSSS❤
=
I hear "stuck on love"
=
I hope after this AOA make it new album and comeback soon ❤️
=
This song is so good though.. I *so* can't wait for the music video/comeback performances
=
Finally how AOA was intended to be! 
=
I just wanna say Chanmi is so freaking beautiful and gorgeous
=
What i love about Queendom is that we can many potentials hidden and it is very refreshing and  wow factor is so on other level!
=
AOA  the comebacks are just so good!
=
Can't wait for their comeback 
=
i really love this concept.. AOA drop it
=
It's soooo satisfying to watch it 
=
It's so cool, wooowAOA
=
THANK YOU SO MUCH AOA :)
Welcome new fan, your decision is absolutely right.
=
Every group did an excellent job! but my personal favorite is AOA! definitely love the song, concept, make up and everything!!! seriously i think if this is their real comeback song, its gonna rock the chart!
=
WOW AOA!! JUST WOW! 
=
Seolhyun❤️❤️❤️
=
AOA was the best of queendom!!
the queens are AOA!!❤❤
=
AOA did the great performance. My true bias is (G)I-DLE. But after see AOA's stage and BTS, still love them. Especially HyeJeong, She so cute in BTS. lol
=
All the song are the best but I'm addicted to this song, Lovelyz Moonlight and Mamamoo Destiny. I keep coming back to listen to these songs.
=
I hope AOA drops it.. and by that I mean a new album 
=
AOA's cowboys/cowgirls vibe is impeccable. AOA really fit in "Once Upon A Time In The West" concept. Chanmi, AOA's action heroine, kicks butts and stuns everyone. Seolhyun with american indian plaited-hair is the sweetest cowgirl.
=
I love this different concept for AOA.. Very good 
=
Seolhyun voice is so mesmerizing
=
Gosh Chanmi slayed this stage 
=
ChanMi rifa!! ♥
=
I almost forget when was the last time aoa be like this...
I always think that aoa was forced to do sexy concept back then
Cmiiw
=
I know there can only be one winner but in a way i think all the groups/Park Bom won because this show let them show people/fans what they can do other than the music/concepts they are known for.And they were all crazy good!
=
AOA❤️
=
Live action 
=
How can they be that badass and elegant at the same time! I'm not crying (ಥ_ಥ)
=
JIMIN ATE UP HER VERSE
=
Tbh only AOA, (G)-IDLE and Lovelyz are the one willing to get out of their comfort zone on this show. Mamamoo and OMG are good but they been doing the same exact concepts and stages over and over again, too bad popularity is all that matter by the end of the day on these survival shows.
=
haters: Chanmi can't even have a stage presence since she was 5th on solo dance round
Chanmi : hold my mic
=
Before this show I underestimated AOA as just a fanservice group. Now I know how talented and hardworking they are, they have a new fan!
=
I hope Queendom performs at MAMA2019 all idols
=
Personally, I think AOA is the real winner here. The public love them so much that they always trending whenever Queendom airs and they start to get their public recognition again. And not to forget, they got new fans too since most of the new kpop stan don't know AOA before. Hope they will be more active again as a group after this. Fighting!!!
=
Call everyone who's streaming to AOA Egotistic to here, please help them and streaming for this
=
To be honest, this is my first time knowing AoA since I entered into kpop world 5 years ago. And I only wanna say one thing. They are so good, I got interested on them after watching them on Queendom. They really did their best and from now I'm gonna support their next projects ❤️
=
Still can't find my jaw after Chanmi's fight scene.
=
In AOA everyone is a visual..
=
Notice the first man takes a while to stand up after taking a leg in the belly from chanmi. Strong girl, though accidental..
=
I'm going to stan this group now cause their queendom performances are unreal
=
MY HEART IS LITERALLY BEATING SO FAST WHEN IM WATCHING THIS . GOSH AOA SLAYED .... I LOVE YOU GUYS ... OH AND CHANMI SHOWED EVERYONE THAT SHE DOESNT PLAY AROUND ... ELVIS FOREVER...
=
They all slayed and that fights scene where she got lifted went so smoothly 
=
All the groups did so well omg, that chanmi cut so badass
=
I love that fight scene I want more
=
They deserve to win. Well, at least chanmi with that dance break ❤️
=
damn chanmi really killed this performance and called us weak
=
That fight scene got me *Shook!!*
I'm in love with this song
They did amazing
=
That had me screaming in my seat. So amazing! Love these ladies!
=
This is amazing! Woah!
=
Jimin and Chanmi deserved it. Legends always will be legends...
=
When is the mv coming
=
"kpop is trash"
me: 3:23
=
Seolhyun is so so so pretty!
=
AOA so great! Love them.
=
AOA are definitely back! I love y'all!
=
i am addicted to this song and performance
=
I like this style AOA。Amazing。
=
meu AOA tá vivo, mana ♥
=
My favourite part 
Fighting part 
Also how many members are they last performance was 4
=
Chanmi's fight scene gave me black widow vibes
=
It reminds me of 'no more sad songs' by little mix  but damn they snapped
=
Love them!
=
Chanmi kicks ass!!! I’m in love !!
=
Can't wait for the MV !!!
=
Whoop. Queens slayed
=
AOA and Mamamoo did the best for the final. Sorry just my opinion. I really love the songs and the performance was both really great. What a good opening and ending to the finals.
=
Damn.....I'm actually speechless
=
Yuna is so freacking sexy 
=
chanmi did that, but seolhyun, your tongue, YOU DIDNT NEED TO DO THATTTTT
=
Seolhyun looks so good in this style
=
The best final performance in my opinion, so so good!!
=
JIMIN URI LEADERNIM SO FIERCE!
=
cameraman at 2:09 on point!
=
Listening to the song more than I thought I'd be. It's really good! Way better over headphones, the work on the synths really shines there. AOA really surprised me throughout Queendom. Their Egotistic performance was amazing.
=
jimin
=
Chanmi is such a queen
=
TRUE LEGENDS
=
Is no one going to talk about Hyejeong doing the perfect hat setup @1:35 for the sunset group pose @5:18? Daebak!
=
Damn i stan
=
Queens!! Forever !!!
=
Chanmi wa....
=
ME ENCANTAN ❤ mis REINAS ❤❤
=
Everyone expect a AOA comeback for this song 
=
อยากให้Choa กลับมา​เธอหายหรือยัง​
=
I miss u girls ...
=
Good job Girls!
=
more appreciation needed for Yuna being a badass. Our elegant vocal queen now has a bad side.
=
They didnt win but AOA IS THE MVP of this competition. Periodttt
=
Chanmi part killed me
=
when jimin say “AOA Drop it” my tears  also drop it 
=
At first I can't imagine how would they perform this song and then they go on cow girl concept
SHIN JIMIN IS A TOTALLY GENIUS
FNC needs to let them involved more in directing the concept
Chanmi fought scene, incredible
Love how they rearranged some part and added more rap part, that was such a killer move
Rediscovering AOA through Queendom was the best thing happened to me in 2019
=
Now we all know where Black Widow's soul was sent to: back in time to save kpop
=
I need a MV please
=
G IDLE COMING BACK WITH LION
MAMAMOO COMING BACK
IS AOA GONNA OFFICIALLY COMEBACK WITH SORRY
=
aoa sure so talented.
=
Rainhas meu 
=
Wow wow wow wow...    
=
Keren banget
=
3M??
=
CHANMI LITERALLY KILLEDDD THIS STAGE.like broooooo whyyyy did she place so low in the dancing competition.
=
Tbh I think AOA had all the best performace the whole season maybe they did not win on the show but they really won my heart
p.s g-idle made an mv for LION I hope AOA make one for sorry too
=
is it only me or anyone else too that after hearing this song it feels like hearing fifth harmony or little mix vibe in the entire song and its not boring
=
IM CRYING BECAUSE THEY DID WELL THEY STILL THE FIRST IN MY HEART
AOA ARE NO FINISHED PLEASE STAN HER THEY ARE SO COOL !!!RIGHT THEY DID MISTAKE BUT REMEMBER THEIR SONG ALL THE GOOD SONG THEY DID. I WILL BE AN ELVIS FOR EVER
=
So happy and proud of them, they really deserve more spotlight 
=
Favorite queendom performance. These girls did such an amazing job. Especially Chanmi! omg shes so badass!! Such beautiful and talented ladies ❤
=
Minhas Favoritas I Love You AOA!!! 
Jimin ❤️
=
I like them more as 5  ❤️
=
Guys, Aoa supposed trending...help make it real.....what a incredible performance....chanmi...u very killed it.  .. awesome
=
I like the intro and ending...but it's bit long and affect the dynamic of performance (my opinion )...they did well btw... can't wait for their comeback 
=
I LOVE THIS MUSIC!
=
Whatever what happened I will Stan AOA 4ever
=
I like AOA's final stage , it shows their hardwork and passion in performing. I hope to see more AOA stages in the future 
-sincerely, a moomoo
=
ALREADY THE WINNER IN MY HEART
=
I am crying at now  I'm so proud of you girls 
=
Seolhyun’s voice in low register is beautiful
=
Watching them on Queendom, my affection for them started to grow. They did so well and impressed me when I really wasn't expecting that. Now I like them a lot and will continue to support them. I love this song, it's stuck in my head! And this whole western vibe performance with fight scene was the best. I'm Texan, what else can I say 
=
This is crazy!  To precious to be true i am not even a fan of them before this program, but now all my uTube history is full of them 
=
Seolhyun I wasn't ready at 4:28
=
They are just amazing!
=
Wtf was that? I love the song so much and then that fight scene omg. Epic. I never was a fan of AOA because their songs were always so high pitched and overly sexy. Nothing against that but Queendom really showed their true colours and their true talent. Very very talented group. I stan. ❤️
=
3:35 i want to be this guy
=
I love how Chanmi is receiving the atention She deserves, I'm so happy because has a lot of center positions. I hope She has tje same focus and atention with AOa comeback 
=
AOA IS THE QUEEN !!! 
They win my heart ! 
=
best final performance! no one can change my mind
=
Yuna is so cute and pretty
=
omg CHANMI had done the problem so good 3:40
=
Elvis will always support you!
Chanmi SLAYs at fighting scene 
Our precious girls, success!
=
That fight scene itself alone deserves 1st place.
Great performance!
=
Chanmi her name? I stan
=
YEE HAW  AOA. YEE HAW I SEE YOU AOA. I SEE YOU. YEE HAWW
=
It gave me a Charlie's Angels vibe ❤ #AOA
=
Best dance break of Queendom
=
Through Queendom, AOA was reborned and I feel it let us see a different side of AOA we never did. I was never really interested in them, but now I'm excited to see what they'll put out next! I hope that after this, they'll hopefully do well and gain more attention.
=
the lyrics of this song are written really well
=
AOA is the first K-POP group that  introduced K-pop to me, they were always QUEENS in my eyes and are QUEENS NOW TOO I REALLY LOVE HOW THiS SHOW GAVE THEM CHANCE TO PROVE THAT THEY'RE STİLL GREAT PERFORMERS. AND THEY SHOWED DİFFERENT CONCEPTS, DİFFERENT SİDES of THEM
=
I am hoping for AOA comeback album ❤️
=
So beautiful! 
=
jimin and seolhyun are so sexy  chanmi is cool and badass
=
I LOVE IT❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
This song is super catchy. I love it 
=
Yeahhh 
=
I Love you 
=
AOA Drop it! Im new fans for AOA. Because of Queendom.
=
اطلق ادااااااااء 
=
For me that performance should win and nothing matters more than my opinion. 
=
Nothing to so say. Just WOWWWWW !!!!!! 
=
Jimin
=
I can’t handle with yuna ;-; did i just fall in love right??
=
The Queens are back!!!!
=
welcome back aoa
=
I don’t know why but this song reminds me of American pop song
=
AOA proving again that there is still so much more that they're capable of if given the chance.
=
As an Elvis that started to follow them in 2013, i never thought AOA will lose 3 members and will slay the stage as 5. This performance was so amazing that i feel like this side of AOA, this part of AOA has never been shown before. I can see their passion, their hardwork, their vision and how much they love each other, the stage and their fans. I'm so proud that i don't feel any word will suffice with how proud i am of them. AOA as 5 is still AOA. AOA as 8 is also AOA. I LOVE THEM.

p.s. Chanmi totally slayed her parttttttt OMG
=
I actually think this was the best final performance lol
=
I am so happy to see aoa out there performing again like back in their prime days but sad to see 1 by 1 members leaving from 7 member grp to now a 5 member =(. Anyways to aoa, fighting!!!! =)
=
jimins charisma is intense
=
I hope our famdom get bigger
=
I m obese with this song
=
Fuuuu Chanmi ahsjsuebfjejsk damn AOA killed it
=
AoA Chanmi MY DANCE LOVe
=
AOA’s growth makes me cry  from girl band, to overly sexualized girls, to empowered women  I am so happy for them to finally do what they really want.
=
AOA stage is my favourite every week 
I love them ❤
=
AOA stage is my favourite every week 
I love them ❤
=
We need to see the reactions of other girl groups while watching this epic performance from AoA. Especially OMG's reaction.
=
AOA got me into Kpop. I will always have a soft spot for them. Other idols may sing better or dance better, but they are not AOA. AOA have never been a typical girl group, they broke the mould and I felt they had to work harder and fight harder for any success they had. Overall, if you were a neutral, you will be wandering how AoA finished 4th based on their amazing performances. I am just glad they got to perform and have the chance to show everyone what they are about. Talented hardworking queens. Take a bow.
=
AOA stage is my favourite every week 
I love them ❤
=
The ‘Aoa drop it’ makes me goosebumps
=
AOA slayed it
=
AOA drop it! wow i like Jimin's voice 
=
Broken Love Song with Cowboy outfit ?
Only AOA can do that
=
yuna part make me goosebump..holy she is freaking perf
=
STAN AOA FOREVER! ❣️❣️❣️ IM SO HAPPY COZ THEY WERE ABLE TO GET BACK ON THEIR TRACK. THANKS QUEENDOM MY QUEENS GOT MORE RECOGNITIONS. MY HEART IS CRYING BECAUSE OF HAPPINESS ❣️❣️
=
so fking perfect aoa！
=
and now all of us should support AOA for their first comeback as 5. YOU GO GIRLS!!!
=
The most enjoyable performance from the very start till it end.. My eyes and ears are pleased.. They should be win.. Im a blackjack/bomshell btw..
=
Is their comeback gonna be with this cowgirl concept?
=
mamamoo is my fave group so i'm happy they won but this performance was on another level. it's aoa's world and we're just living in it.
@ everyone make sure to support their comeback in november!
=
That fighting scene was EPIC
=
i've never expected chanmi to do that flip fight, but woahhh she really suprised me
=
Holy shit. That. Was just Insane. 
As an Elvis I've never seen them perform like this. Maybe they realized with their last performance that they needed more punch and acting. But SHIT THAT WAS GOOD. CONGRATS ON MY FIVE MEMBERS❤❤
=
Since there have been 4 seasons of produce , pls do many seasons for queendom too . Its not about competing but it will give another chance for old group to show their talent . And also to new group to learn more . I love how the groups supporting each other ❤
=
i just hoping that their company giving them a chance to comeback as a five member.
=
We Need The MV!!!!
=
Seolhyun should do cover of Lana Del Rey!
=
I vote this for the best..
Choreography, expressions, character, song
Their so mature, there is something about aoa that cannot be compare to other group. And i love they way their pull of every member out. Not like "one" other group that always show off 1 person
=
Ace of Angels indeed love u guys and I'm proud of you
=
FNC, please give them this type of music more!!!
=
AOA ファイティン❣️
=
The audio was messed up at the end but they still slayed
=
Wow
=
I always lost my shit whenever the camera shows seolhyun.. like wow
=
WOW, so good
=
AOA IS SOO ICONIC
=
2019 AOA ARE REALLY NOT A JOKE!!!! I don't care about winning, just seeing AOA back in stage is already bring me to tears
=
BEST EVER.
=
With 1,25x speed I think this fun.
=
Aoa drop it - jimin 2019
=
AOA got robbed, they deserved to win queendom
=
Never sleep on APA
=
Sorry but this was the BEST performance, PERIODT.
=
TUDO PRA MIM
=
I can't wait for their upcoming comeback. Give us the exact day fnc you coward.
=
Even though they didn't win, they benefited a lot from the show. People got to see different sides of AOA and that the girls still have a lot to offer
=
Seolhyun looks so confident TT
=
AOA Việt Nam  ❤❤❤❤
=
i need to admit it
*this is the best performance of the night among all the contestants!*
=
AoA continua mitando como sempre continuem assim q vcs alcancem BlackPink ou Twice
=
AOA ES ARTE!!!
=
สองล้านวิวแล้วววว...เย้...!
=
Why this masterpiece is not trending? 
=
=
Aoa born again woow
=
AOA drop it
=
Is nobody gonna talk about how professionally chanmi put back the audio thing at 3:39? That shit was so clean omg
=
if you see something flying

that's my wig snatched.
=
I'm gonna miss AOA in here. They were the funniest group among Queendom ❤
=
Jimin added another versus to the song cuz she knew we said her versus was to short!!! the beginning was the best! It felt like they were referencing their first first opening to queendom!
=
I actually cried while watching this...   I AM SO PROUD OF THEM!!! they did not stop and prove that AOA is still on fire! 
=
I already heard this song before this but I was not expecting everything that came after Chanmi my baby girl WTF I WAS SHOOK
=
Amazing!!! I didn’t see that coming!!!
=
Chanmi is the best!! Love her
=
ok but this song can be a whole comeback song im- 
=
Okay i love mamamoo but i got to say out of all the final performance, this one was the best woooowww
=
Chanmi was so professional when her mic kinda came out after the fight scene... we stan Chanmi and we stan AOA
=
This performance really alleviated the song
=
Tbh I didn’t know AOA much before Queendom. I used to associate them as Seolhyun and Jimin’s group but maaaan I’m so happy Chanmi and Hyejeong got their chance to shine through this show. Hyejeong is freaking hilarious and the fact that she’s the lead singer now proves she’s more than her looks and gimmick personality. As for Chanmi, she is definitely their secret weapon. The fact that she learned this choreography in a week and pulled it off effortlessly shows how passionate and talented she is. And sadly, I felt Yuna was that one member who didn’t get a chance to showcase herself but she proves through their performances that she’s capable of being main vocal. And lets not forget that time when she fixed the kimchi soup from going bad. 
I respect their original team line up but I love them as a five member group, obviously because I barely got to know them in this era. I’m looking forward to seeing their continuous growth through their future comebacks! 
=
Fantastic, fighting AOA
=
Have goosebump every time after watching Chanmi performed her epic act
=
can't wait for their official comeback!
=
wah,,,, love this concept so much
=
Chanmi ！！！！！！！！！AOA！！！！！！！！！！！！！I LOVE YOU
=
I love this so much!!!!!
=
So, the hat in the centre of the stage was thrown by Hyejeong... Haha!
=
The vibe that this song can bring is everything!! knowing that i heard it for the first time, it's very nostalgic already.
=
WHO WANTS TO FIGHT WITH CHANMI?! NEVER MESS WITH THIS BADASS. 
=
SO.DAMN.COOL!!! i literally shouted during chanmi action scenes 
AOA SLAAAAY
=
I maybe late for Queendom, but not yet for AOA's future comebacks. I'm looking forward! 7year curse broken.
=
unbelievable.fantastic.amazing.one of the best performance this year
=
最後一集Queendom中我最喜歡的一首歌，旋律好好聽❤️
=
Stan AOA Stan Queens 
=
this was my worth it winner
=
AoA Perfect
=
Damn why are they so tall?
=
We elvis dont really care about the final rank bcs we know AOA is the winner in our heart. Yuna has proven her words! AOA is still alive and still good as before (even better imo)
=
I dont get why this song only spot on as 4th. This is freaking addicting tho. This was the best song for me along with Mamamoo. Fr
=
AOA drop it!!!!!
=
Chanmi finally showing she is a dancing genius, those moves were incredible
=
AOA!!!♥♥♥
=
next comeback like this please
=
AOA. Hope after this they will gain their fame back because these girls deserve so much love. ♥️ Amazing stage performance.
=
AOA was robbed in this show from beginning to end but we all know they're the real winners
=
I don’t care about rankings anymore. AOA are the real winners
=
I was waiting to see Yuna in a concept like this again since Get Out.
=
So good! I like It
=
Las amo demasiado espero verlas de nuevo muy pronto
=
The members have suffered a lot throughout their career. Despite that, they clearly still want to give 110% into being AOA. I love their dedication and I know that Queendom has completely changed the public's opinion of the girls. They aren't just pretty faces or sexy icons, they are truly versatile performers.
=
Honestly, i dont know how many times i repeat this video. For me, this performance is the best of all the performances. Anyways, congratulations to the winners.
=
Guys at the end there is to be countinued, they are having a comback this month sometime so they are continuing on with this song sorry, I think. I’m so excited for the comeback
=
all those so called rapper in queendom can retire, top madame jimin is here
=
I knew they can do this girl crush concept so naturally.
=
"Nobody is perfect."
Kim Chanmi just said "wrong!" to our face. Like, come on, she can dance, she can rap, she can sing, she has an amazing stage presence, her expressions are on point, her visuals are no joke... And that action scene. You've been underrated for too long sweet angel. It's time to rise and shine.
=
my fav part every time jimin say this " AOA DROP UT "
=
I’ve always loved Chanmi, and seeing my baby glow makes me so happy!!
=
Can't stop watching this video, the performance was soooo cool
Hyejeong expression
Yuna center part in the last stop the love
Seolhyun killing part 
Jimin smirk and that AOA drop it
And dedicated legend Chanmi, that live fighting scene while several weeks ago she had a problem on her ankle but still slayed fighting scene, one take and live, and probably only take several weeks at top for her to practice that scene
AOA only served the best of the best on the show
From Miniskirt to Egotistic to Instagram-Strip-Power to IJB-T4SA-PUSS to Sorry
Ace of Queendom indeed
=
"Ace of Queendom, AOA"
=
5:22 I know this wasn't intentional, but whoever threw that hat just made the performance have so much more meaning
=
Omh love their motion and feeling
=
AOA is the best group of Queendom and I don't care about the ranking <3
=
holy shit this blew my expectations off the roof. i always thought jimins rap part in the original song was too short and she DELIVERED here omfg. and CHANMI???!!!!! SHE ATEEEEE THAT FIGHT SCENE ACE OF QUEENDOM INDEED
=
I LOVE THIS PERFORMANCE. IT WAS SO AMAZIIIIING!!!!
=
I'm so happy that this kind of competition(queendom) some doors were opened again fo AOA. And as an Elvis, I'm so grateful that there are comments who say that they will stan AOA because of queendom and AOA can finally shine again, brighter than before. Thanks mnet for this opportunity you gave for our girls. I'm glad that some of the comments say they will start to stan AOA and gained a lot of fans again. AOA fighting!
=
This. I am hellla ready for a full comeback. AOA fighting!
=
They're so amazing. <3
=
Wow the artist really evolved. Love it
=
They’re ammmaaaaazzziiiinnggggg
=
Que maravilhosas ❤❤
=
Love their cowboy outfits
=
This performance, along with MAMAMOO's and OMG's, are my favorites. There's just something about their performances that makes it cohesive and PERFECT. I love the songs too, and I'm happy that AOA has definitely come back to their fame and fans even after everything happened. Please support them in their upcoming comeback!
=
They did amazing
=
the best 
=
Streaming strong
=
I can feel Little Mix vibes ..and I stan both groups (AOA and Little Mix) as they show us GIRLPOWER
=
CAN NOT BELIEVE SHE PULLED THAT
=
i think this kind of concept suits AOA so much
=
I found the winner 
=
Seolhyun 
=
This song is my new jam its sooo gucci like man can have this on repeat for soo long and not get bored. LOVE AOA
=
Wow! Their performance is phenomenal! It’s so exciting to watch
=
Yasssss! That's my queens right there! AOA fighting! Jimin, Seolhyun, Hyejeong, Yuna, Chanmi! Fighting!
=
ace of queendom
=
The dive at 3:31 tho. WOAH
=
The best song for me in the finals.
=
AOA deserves so much respect....i my opinion they are BACK!!!! this show should give them to boost they needed. they have shown so much creativity, singing and dancing ability. they deserve so much from their hard work.  jack usa
=
I was utterly shocked @3:35

=
Always loved Chanmi
She's been so underrated since their debut and she finally gets the attention she deserves! That fight scene was everything ❤
=
I really respect SeolHyun. She still filming My Country drama but look at how she perform here. She get accurate dance moves, energetic stage presence, strong facial expressions and nice vocal. 
I will seriously support AOA comeback this time.
=
Ayosss ang galing!
=
I LOVE JIMIN'S 'AOA DROP IT'
I LOVE CHANMI'S ACTIONS
I LOVE HYEJEONG'S SOFT VOICE
I LOVE SEOLHYUN'S EXPRESSIONS
I LOVE YUNA'S  CLEAR VOICES!!!
=
Chanmi's part is one of best thing that ever happened in KPOP history wow
=
Honestly I only watch AOA's performances for this entire queendom. I don't care they are not the winner because I already know who the real winner in my heart ❤️ I can't wait for their comeback if this performance was slayed how about the upcoming performances? AOA unnies still my favorite after all 
=
oh cool concept
=
АOA ❤❤❤
=
One of the best performances AOA has given, Queendom has provided and K-pop has showcased. AOA really are on another level than what they were before and I’m totally here for this character development! ❤️
=
QUISIERA VER UN SPECIAL STAGE DE ESTA CANCIÓN
=
Everyone expectation : Summer Paradise , ocean waves feels 
Jimin : Hold my shotgun ¡
=
AOA is the best^^^^
=
Is she dancer who ranked 5th? You kidding me, Mnet...
=
Its hard to do rough dancing but still maintain elegant. Only aoa.
=
I know when they threw the hats, one of them wasn't supposed to land in front of the stage but that made for an iconic ending scene.
=
i got the chills yall, this deserves better
=
I WANNA CRY HOW POWERFUL THIS PERFORMANCE THAT'S EXCEED MY EXPECTATIONS OMG I LOVE AOA!
=
Chamni rise bby girl. Jimin like always the boosy leader. I love this song so much.
=
That was the best performance I have seen so far, the entire show included wow
=
I feel like I’m watching Lesley in MLBB dancing 
=
Chanmi as expected so professional. Indeed.
=
Forget it i like all Queendom contestants final song..i just can't pick one.. always come back to every each of them.. honestly everyone is a winner
=
Jimin killed it
=
DONT TELL ME YOU DONT SAY DROP IT BEFORE JIMIN SAYS IT!

I have it on repeat
=
i already saw all performance... i think AOA song, vocal, performance number 1!!!!!!!
=
Daaang!! Since their debut, I've been hypnotize by their beauty, sexiness and all package performance.  
I believe AOA is one of the group that can literally do all the concept plus they can do band. Not all groups can do what AOA does. ❤
=
I love youuuuu my mother fxxckin top madam, you are amazing 
=
OMG OMG OMG OMG ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

=

=
Jimin: AOA
Me: DROP IT!!!!! 
omg chanmi’s solo and the dance break is insane!!! the results may not be the best but i’m so so proud of AOA they have come so far :”)
=
This show makes everyone know the real AOA, who surprise us again and again.
=
yuna's voice is wonderful
=
AOA In 2019 is better,
I think is the best performance then another in final
=
She did a Frankensteiner?!!
=
aoa slayed it, i can’t imagine what their comeback are gonna be like. 
=
YASSSSS AOA SLAYYYYY
TO BE CONTINUEDDDDD CANT WAIT FOR THEIR COMEBACK PLS ANNOUNCE THE DATE ALREADY TTTTT
=
petition to include "yee haw" in their fanchant
=
Jimin?? Blonde??? Ok.
=
=
chanmi absolutely owned this stage!! her expressions and her dancing omg, she's amazing!!
=
Good lord Chanmi
=
AOA is the best!!
=
I’m officially a fan of theirs after queendom
=
We did 1M, don't forget to always streaming all the time, let's go 2M
=
From: Hey
To: AoA drop it
=
AOA never disappoints, I’m so glad my girls got the opportunity to come on this show and show other ppl how AOA works!! ELVIS!!
=
Seolhyun low notes, with Black Widow Chanmi? I think yes
=
SEOLHYUN , 
=
Chanmi snatched my WIG! ❤
=
3:56 - 4:47 i am looping this for like 10 minutes now, so good
=
the fighting part was so cool tho she really head locked him with her thighs
=
the best perfomance ever,,,
=
Wow, Chanmi, I love you more every day!
=
I'm glad I watched this show and discovered new girl groups. AOA has hella bops!
=
WOW IM SPEECHLESS..

=
That was really awesome and i'm impressed what Chanmi learned in just one week
=

=
MELHOR APRESENTAÇÃO DO QUEENDOM ❤
=
wow uri maknae <3
=
4:25 seolhyun heavy breathing be like....daaaahhhhuuuuummmnnnnnn...
=
I love AOA’s sexy style, love !!! Don,t change anything
=
Out of topic, but I need a collaboration of Seolhyun, Joy, Bora and Yuri! Those 4 have the same spark and an amazingly distinct voice!
=
I think they really suit with cowgirl concept, they did once in Excuse Me too
=
Best song ever of AOA for me
=
AOA la mejor presentacion de la final.
=
I'am a moomoo but I really like this song ❤️
=
Sorry sorry sorry i love AOA,for me chanmi the best main dancer
=
This is actually my favourite song from the episode. No maybe even from the whole show
=
Ah, sayang bajunya ga terlalu kece buat aoa. 
=
หนึ่งล้านวิวแล้ววววว.......1M!
=
seolhyun is the prettiest cowgirl her tanskin makes her beauty expose
=
For me for tonight performances THIS IS THE BEST
=
Why isn't this their COMEBACK ??!?! It's really good
=
AOA really did THAT ! eventhough they performed first last night their stage was one of most memorable stage for me
=
MAMA2019 PLEASE HAVE THEM ALL IN ONE STAGE!!! MEDLEY STAGE OF QUEENDOM OR ANYTHING AS LONG AS ALL OF THE ARTISTS ARE PERFORMING ON MAMA2019 PLEASEEEE
=
They are still have so much potential. FNC you need to let them come back! Can't wait to see AOA
=
Amazing
=
in this competition, AOA tell to everyone that they still alive and still can show their charms..
after this competition all contestants will set high quality performance, songs and charms just like they showed in this program..
keep support and cheers your idol = AOA..
cheers from mamamoo fans ♥️♥️♥️
=
It’s so bittersweet that we never got to see this creative  side of AOA before... the sexy concept brought them fame but these Queendom performance totally merits the acknowledgement and respect of kpop fans around the world >__<
=
=
The secret side of AOA that just revealed now. Legend is back
=
AOA IN MAMA 2019 STAGE PLEASE MNET
=
May be is the answer of Super Junior Sorry Sorry song :) 
Don't judge me
=
Somebody: complaining that the song is not complete because there's no Jimin iconic line.
Jimin: *slowly spits fire
A.OA. Drop. It. 
=
I always wonder, with this much potentials why the company didnt explore much?
=
Seriously, the group that proves to be worthy and completely surprises me through out all episodes is AOA!!!!!
=
Seriously, I think Chanmi is a  top secret agent!
=
Chanmi nailed it
=
AOA OWNS ME AT THIS POINT
=
Holy shit they deserve this win!!!!
=
3M?
