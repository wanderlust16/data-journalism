i'm the one english comment what you looking for 
=
This English comment will save life's 
Love u lovelyz
=
When all the comments are in hangul and you don't understand a thing
=
am i the only one who’s not korean here? Can’t understand the comments afff
=
01:03 Shushuhua is mesmerized. they need to do a song with aegyo concept
=
I'm the english comment that you're looking for.
=
When you are trying to do girl crush with cute song xD
=
I really love this performance and I feel bad for just watching this today. I really love the dance break. Dear Woolim, just for once, Lovelyz in girl crush concept on their next comeback.
=
I miss this show 
=
I always love watching the male reaction to when they're being cute. And their voices all sound very cute. And the chants I find it all really cute haha
=
Lovelyz doing some girl crush concept?? Am Im dreaming??
=
*so this is the reason why woollim don't let lovelyz do a girl crush because all lovelinus will die and no one will stream, vote and buy their merchandise.*
=
They changed the choreography a little ❤️
=
Wheein: It’s a Dance break
Other members: WOW 
=
They're so gorgeous ❤️
=
They amazing
=
3:16 Cucok ya beb.
=
1:20 ^♡^
=
srsly they're so pretty and talented, I'm so jealous uwaaaaaa
=
Sweet ah choo no more. Lovelyz didn't disappoint 
=
2:16 his face is me right now
=
Lovelyz got the lowest votes in audience but even with that, we can clearly hear the fanchant for Ah Choo! The relationship between Lovelyz and Lovelinus is truly amazing! To Lovelinus in the venue~ thank you for that amazing fanchant! Hihihi.
=
Im the english comment you're looking for . They're cute but the performance is not as amazing as aoa, bommie and mammamoo 
=
I guess your scrolling and looking for me??
=
Hi, I speak English! Anyone? lool
=
2:02
=
<3
=
This is the english comment you looking for 
=
2:03 someone control MoonSun their gay is popping out 
=
No way, there couldn't be someone who doesn't like this *BEAUTIFUL* performance❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
as if they changed the chreography into Hoya’s Ah-choo styles...
=
2:01
=
3:15
=
2:14 ¿¿?
=
Ah-Choo gothic ver! I like the fact that I got to see a new side of Lovelyz ♡
=
Bener bener bikin jatuh cinta uhhhh   
=
0:00?
=
I know that Lovelyz is trying to explore the girl crush concept but you see their forte is in innocence and purity concept.  I hope they would work on that.  I know that a lot of people are saying that they should change concept to 'become more famous' but that's not the way to go.  The sexiest they can go I think is Destiny.  But even Destiny still has innocence and purity.
=
I am a fan BUT it is too obvious that most of them didn't feel comfort with this sexy concept. Only 3 that really suit with the concept, especially *MiJu* . Just my opinion, I still love them but not the concept.
=
3:16 ??
=
Ah choo sexy version
.
Did anyone ask for it?
No. 
But did we needed it?
YES!
=
not a huge lovelyz stan, but after this i must reconsider! their vocals and song are incredible
=
Just a random English Comment pass by,
=
This is just too cute lol
=
3:06
=
Kwon eunbi stan
Kim chaewon stan
Cha junho stan
Lets help our sunbae in this program
=
1:09
2:52
3:50
=
I wonder why their company didn't give them a dark/ girl crush concept
=
Trying to look hot yet there so cute
=
Its kinda weird when they doing cute expression with a girl crush concept. That part taking off their jacket while doing cute expression... just weird...
=
Wow, many Korean comments, I wonder what they're saying :0
=
I think i prefer the original ah choo. The song don't not fit girl crush. It could be better if they used in other songs.
=
Just a random english comment passing through
=
2:44 I have seen him multiples times on some of Queendom’s performances. I won’t disagree if the cameraman always focus on him cause who wouldn’t??? Gosh, I need to know his name! 
=
The fact that they prepared this stage while rehearsing for their 3 day concert and promoting it's nuts. It might not be the BEST stage, but it's really impressive the effort they put in it. Good job Lovelyz! I hope you will be able to get 1st place with sixth sense! 

Lovelyz fighting!
=
jisoo fancams please mnet
=
idk why people are offended when kpop artists try to be sexy and cute at the same time.. i mean THEY REALLY OWNED THE STAGE
plus the japanese are into that
=
They have a concert coming during this time and still give it all for this performance. Good job ladies.
=
MY GOD
=
This is some year end concept performance. Can't wait for their sixth sense performance.
=
i've watched all the performances and clearly anyone would say AOA or Mamamoo even g.ilde had the better performance but stages like this and Oh My Girl stage are great examples of what it means to perform. they evoked emotions out of everyone who were watching. it was more mesmerizing than flashy and exciting. when i look at them perform i can't help but stare. i see Lovelyz and Oh My Girl in a new light. i truly believe that both groups created a stage very unique to their image, a stage the other girls would never be able to do.
=
It's great but at the same time it's weird too
=
This is funny lmao
=
They did great but l think they chose the wrong song for this concept, they could choose destiny maybe (that's more dramatic) l mean it's kinda awkward bcs the concept doesn't suit the lyrics
=
The good thing about this show is that all groups seems to be enjoying each other performances and having fun. Let us do the same fandoms, let's have fun while supporting their show. Enjoy the music!
=
Dark concept? No problem! All hail our queens!!!
=
This reached a million much faster than their mvs. Slowly but surely. Keep the pace ladies.
=
Please Woollim let Mijoo do a sexy concept, and add Jisoo, Yein and Sujeong.
Let Kei, Jiae, Baby Soul and Jin do a ballad concept, maybe. Just have Mijoo do something she’s happy about.
=
After watching all 6 performances I can understand why they placed last this round. The girls did and looked great but they didn't quite play to their strength. Ah Choo as a song is way too cute for this concept even if they changed the arrangement. IMO it would have worked better if they sticked to a brighter concept for this song (but upgraded arrangement) or did this concept with a song like Destiny to showcase girl crush+ knife like choreo.
Hope to see a comeback next round!
=
BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT YEIN AND MIJOO DANCING ON THE FLOOR EVEN WHEN THEY WERE HURT AT THEIR KNEES?? TALK ABOUT QUEENS Y'ALLL
=
Lovelyz is preparing for their concert when they filmed this episode of Queendom. The concert is a 3 day concert and they have different special stages for each day. They prepared song covers which are all lit, summer version of their songs, EDM versions too and they had unit performances. On top of those concert preparations, they are still promoting and had multiple festival schedules. 
They prepared this version of Ah Choo while doing all of that. 
My girls~ you did so well! Let's surprise them more in your next stage :)))))) It is already good that you are able to show this image. Hihihi.
=
Lovelyz just doing warming-up with Ah Choo  for this first stage. They'll getting there slowly but surely
=
< You Achieved Stanning 20 Girl Groups >
Me: ah shit here we go again
=
Let's enjoy every stage performances.. Let's not worries about rankings.. Lovelyz will always be number 1 in every lovelinus hearts.. Fighting!!!
=
What happened to jin's lips?
=
Ni un comentario en español  amo esta canción♡♡♡
=
this is wierd :( i can't understand the feeling that they want to convey :( i expected more because they're lovelyz :( uhhm... i love woollim artists but this performance just didn't match with everything.... bit disappointed :< i hope they will use their own color in the future.. they're sexy but with the ah-choo song? nah.
=
This performance is pretty good to me!
Lovelyz actually suits this darker concept so well
=
The visuals of lovelyz tho
=
Is this the first time i see Lovelyz in this sort of outfits? they just slay me.
=
well, they are called lovelyz for a reason.  no matter what they do, they look lovely!
=
lovelyz be like "you gave us 6th place for this performance" and come back singinging sixth sense
=
We have right to love or not love this performance. Yes it doesn't suit but I love it. Because I know they were so tired and a lot to do when preparing this performance. And for me, they did their best. Don't questioning people who enjoying this.
=
When you want to look sexy infront of your crush but you can't hide your cute side 
=
I dont know but everytime  i hears achoo, it makes me emotional
=
is that Y of golden child in yellow flanel?
=
Ah Choo 2019 vers, I prefer this kind of sound so refreshing
=
Lovelyz will slay next week with sixth sense ❤️
=
Ofc mijoo will slay this kind of concept.
But yein & jiae also look stunning!
BUT REALLY QUEEN JISOO DESERVES MORE INDIVIDUAL SHOTS
=
this performance give me goosebumps all over my body...they be going from emotional to sexy to cute in a second
=
You guys did great. I understand you guys were so tired at that moment with your schedule
=
just from my perspective, mijoo, yein and sujeong is perfect for this kind of concept
=
Why only a few views i really wish more
They deserve to get recognition from knetz so much
=
Its not that they can't pull off the sexy concept.... its the song the song honestly doesnt match the concept. I love loveleyz tho
=
Their outfits look very familiar...
=
When they take off their jacket I was like
"Oh, skin exposure!" Actually Im not used seeing them wearing like this! But they slay it. Want to see them to do this kind of concept in the future. Lovelyz fighting!
=
Can anyone tell us who is at 2:43 that minute?
=
INI GROUP APA SI ANJG?  GUA G BISA HANGUL LIAT KOMEN GA NGERTI DONG
=
I can see they really tried but it didn't worked out to combine cute, girl crush and sexy concepts.
=
I'm very confused on what the concept's supposed to be. Girl crush? Cute? The outfit doesn't match the cute expression and stage
=
Woah this concept and outfit suits them, their visuals are on point. Their dancing skills were definitely showcased and I was amazed.
=
They out-AOA-ed AOA!
=
are they trying to be cute or sexy i dont understand
=
Is it only me think Mijo slay this concept❤
=
I know this song 3 days ago, and I can't stop play Ah-choo
Now I found this, and YASS QUEEN 
=
I love the girls and their songs but I'm sorry, I didn't really dig them trying to turn this extremely cute song in a mix of cute/sexy/girl crush...sorry...but I find it kinda weird. Like they should have made it completely sexy/girl crush or stayed with cute- maybe add a fairytale vibe... 
But I'm really looking forward to their next stage!!
=
they just breaking the badass concept only suit hiphop/edm/the sensual song when they sing a cheery bubblegum pop abt sneezing with that outfit and choreo, legends only
=
Do they sing?
=
honestly, the intro was great, also for the whole song vocals and visuals on point. but, i don't know, somehow for me, the rest of the performance wasn't that impressing. although i like the song . . .
=
I personally they didn’t think through the idea of changing into opposite concept. If you reference to SNSD, the goddess of pure concept in all kpop girl groups, you never see them remake Into the New World nor Gee to dark sexy concept...it just doesn’t fit
=
good performance nice vocals, Everything is clear, but no excitement no feelings, just my opinion
=
hahaha, i might be part of the minority, but i really enjoyed this version of ah choo... something about it is very daft punk to me!
=
The English comment that you're looking for
=
My young innocent ah choo has gonee guyss its goin to rad all the goddamn wigs xDD
=
This group is fantastic but since most of these shows are based on popularity I wonder to what extent they have a chance at being recognized for their skills (especially singing-wise). At the very least, I'm glad if they get more exposure from this.
=
Road to 2m views! It's a little bit hard but let's do this!
=
GOOSEBUMPS! WTF. THIS IS AMAZING. WHY WON'T THEY LET LOVELYZ DO A GIRL CRUSH CONCEPT??
=
They were busy and didn't have much time to prepare as others but they did well, love you my babies! Let's get 1st for the next stage
=
How Wheein said “Dance Break” with a straight face
=
I’m so happy that they get more love ,more notice . It doesn’t matter if they will get stay in the show or not but I know they will do theirs best .
=
Their visuals are killing me omg look at jisooooo so beautiful    and Jin with long hair is so beautiful
=
1:22 i love the choreo a lot and also Yein, Mijoo, Sujeong and Jisoo’s charisma
=
Mijoo need to be more careful with what she want to say. Mnet always can give evil editing, up until now Mijoo seems like doesn't know how to have a proper attitude
=
*1:03** shuhua being speechless by yein's visual* ❤️❤️
=
I already repeated this a couple times but still here i am fangirling with ryu sujeong kyaahhh ive been a loyal jin and jisoo stan. And here's sujeong wrecking me. Just wow.
=
2:15 she fits sexy concept for real, jisoo really reminds me of Sojin
=
Please check and support kei lovelyz's solo debut album "Over and Over" with the title track called "I Go". She will solo debut with her real name Kim Jiyeon. Released date tomorrow at Oct 8, 2019. Album preview already released now at Woollim Ent channel. All song worth it to listen.
=
this show is clearly popularity contest, and we all know lovelyz are more than that...we need to get lovelyz out of this
=
Woolim CEO in like 2015: Lovelyz will never do sexy.


2019:
=
so nostalgic. i was so obsessed with this song i got tears when i see this :'(
=
Damn..i looking for english comment.  I love them.. 
=
2:47
2:12
=
Omg
=
Many people complaining about the stage and song but I really loved it
=
Damn the dance break really make my heart skip a beat
=
THAT INTRO HAD ME “WHHAAAAAT”
=
I am so happy that we get to see Lovelyz doing this concept especially for Mijoo in doing this concept with the whole group! ❤️
=
 esperaba más de esta presentación
=
A great performance, they slayed !! I hope they will stay in the show
=
Caution This Is Not typical Lovelyz We All Know  Watch at your Own Risk! Woollim Please don’t think about Lovelyz having This kind of concept cause We (Lovelinus) Don’t wanna die too soon
=
Lovelyz want show that they can do every concept let's appreciated this masterpiece cause we will never have this concept for their comeback song and waiting for sixth sense next week!!!
=
Maybe they're tired. Or the rearrange is kind of underwhelming, i mean if they really want to make it different they need to get rid of those lovely smiles and gentle movements at least... The throwing jackets thingy just doesn't seem to match well...
=
yein & mijoo's dance break looks like Eunbi's part in rumor  Woollim Family 
=
LOVELYZ DID SO WELL
=
1. I was really sad when i know Lovelyz in the last position of queendom round 1. 
This performance was good but i think other group was amazing. Lovelyz need more mentality in competition.
=
Lypsinc????
=
I love seeing how Oh My Girl members noticed the song from the first part.. so cute 
=
WHY AM I CRYING WATCHING THIS?????
=
i keep seeing that checkered guy definitely target lock!
=
they went full AOA stile :)
=
Was expecting a dark concept from the outfits... kinda let down
=
Bless you xdxd

(Salud xd)
=
LOVELYZ MY TALENTED BABIES 
=
00:37 
=
The cutesy song Ah Choo is being sung in a sexy manner. Bitch I can't figured. Lovelyz is truly talented yall
=
They are doing great and they changed almost the choreography. To add that, they're doing this while preparing for concert. Omg, they are powerful! Good job my girls! ❤️
=
I am so impressed with their performance!! Keep it up LOVELYZ!!!! We, LOVELINUS, are here to support you always!!!!
=
Welcome to LOVELYZ's WONDERLAND
Vocal profession group here showing charisma dance break to everyone
Reverse Fairies 
WE'LL REVERSE NEXT TIME DEFINITELY
=
I love lovelyz because their performance always makes me feel uwuu because they are so lovely.. they bring positive vibes
=
Last place? They did very veryyyy well even they have to prepare for their concert. THIS STAGE IS F***KING PERFECT but as always no one appreciate their talents. LOVELYZ DESERVES BETTER LOVELYZ DESERVES BETTER LOVELYZ DESERVES BETTER LOVELYZ DESERVES BETTER
=
Appreciating woollim artist's talents.
=
Mijoo even appeared in koms, idk when she recorded the show but promo album for 1 month, still get invited in events, preparing for the whole 3 days concert, solo stage in concert, queendom, then koms?  Girls really work hard!
Edit: i forget to write about japan promotion for once upon a time album n japan concert too
=
We're still proud of your performance girlss Even though Mnet's edit about your parts were too much exaggerating we know that Lovelyz will always have a great stage/performance. I'm slightly dissapointed with your rank but let's rise up to the next round I don't want you to forcely leave the show. *LOVELINUS FIGHTING! LOVELYZ FIGHTING!*
=
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN COLOR! LEAVE IT IF YOU ARE NOT LOVE IT, ITS SIMPLE DONT MAKE IT COMPLICATED 
=
One advice, if you see any offensive comments, just report. Don't give any attention to it.
=
1:12 GUYS WHO IS SHE?
=
Ah-Choo is that song that makes me tearg everytime. IDK why
=
Lovelyz fighting... 
Im woollim stan from 2010
=
Now we knew why woollim never try to made them do a girlcrush concept.. Its killing us with this concept..
=
I can’t understand any of these comments but I loved this performance
=
还是需要好好考虑一下这个组合的发展路线，唱清纯风的嗓子不适合girl crush！还有这首歌也是完全的变味了。
=
Award must to guve them stage like this
=
The song was cute but arghh! They are too sexy to watch!
I love 'em!
=
Basically everyone complaining here: whAT? thEY dOn'T deSERve 6tH plACE!
Me: Yeah, when you sing a song about your allergies (this is a joke, I've read the lyrics many times), you'll probably not do well.
=
'Ah Choo' song is too cute to have sexy concept performance. Kinda let down on the combination.
=
Damn, are Yein and Kei even real??
=
2:44
=
You did well
=
2:35 who is she?? Why her mouth sing like that???
=
Fighting
=
1:55 and 2:57 those guys are they idol?? , or they were just audience ??
=
750k in two days?? Omg, they don't get these numbers even in their MVs :(( GO GIRLSS
=
2:35 , 4:03 who is she?? Why her mouth sing like that???
=
Yein, Mijoo, Sujeong, Jin and Jisoo just slay the girl crush concept. I need Babysoul and Jiae focus more.
=
I never imagined they can rock this kind of concept. Moreover with Ah Choo. It's really really good
=
3:30 someone help me out who is she 
=
*This* is sixth place? They deserve higher than that! Woollim, it's time for a concept change!
=
*YEIN IN HIGH PONYTAIL IS SUCH A TORTURE!!*
=
Lovelyz
=
im in love with this version
=
The mixing of cute, sexy, sassy and elegant at the same time ❤ this is revolutionary and refreshing... It's good to see something out of the standards
=
Lovelyz is lovelyz .. sweet & energic song .. but all grown up to sexy
=
Queendom made the public and non fans realize how good AOA, OMG and G-idle are but for Lovelyz and Park Bom is the opposite. Lovelyz are lovely and pretty but they can only do cute concepts :/
=
oh my god, this presentation is awesome. I love this version!!! 
Kei looks absolutely beautiful!
good job girls !!
=
...?
=
...?
=
from now when i hear Ah-choo is not the same as before,,GOOD JOB GIRL
=
I can't see English comment. So here... 
=
Felt like JIN should have switched with Kei except the high note. She could have pulled it off better.
=
to everyone who's confused by why lovelyz is not covering omg's song: they won a quest in the show and the prize allowed them to choose any song they want to perform.
=
The high notes and the rap parts were the highlights. Everything else is normal
=
k-pop vs kei-pop
=
見直してみたらそれほど悪くはないんだけど、最初聞いたときは声が弱々しくて情けなかった。
声量、声の強さが足りない。不安定なところが一つでもあると曲全体の印象が悪くなる。
なにより、選曲のためにオーマイガールと比較されるのではなくブラウンアイドガールズと比較されてしまったのが作戦ミスだったろう。
=
3:33 her voiceeee
=
That girl in 2:12 from one fine week was the reason why I came here
=
am i the one who thinks that Sujeong's voice fits Gain's vocal line?
=
Oh my girl, hyejung, shuhua, adorable reactions.
=
Did you notice that at 4:54 they repeated the frame of Bom dancing to Fire covered by G-Idle? I guess they wanted to show more interactions of her LOL
=
BEG are so grateful for lovelyz covered one of their hard songs! :'3
=
Even if they had performed OMG's song they prob would still get hate.  People might say 'lovelyz didn't give justice to the song'  or else. So it was a good decision to try something that they had been longing for when they had the opportunity.
=
First time, I don't like this but I can't stop listening to LOVELYZ and now i love this.
=
I love that they decided to do concepts like this for the first two stages instead of doing regular Lovelyz things. Mad respect.
=
I was not ready for SooJung to bring her inner GaIn out 
=
Although i don't feel this concept fits Lovelyz, i still hit like button this video. They actually praticed hard for this, "POP" chorus is the part i was looking forward to hear a strong vocal but they chose Kei, however they make up with those FREAKING high notes at the end. Fighting Lovelyz, you amazed me!
=
Guess what, the performance they done perfect got lesser views, while the performance with many hate comments got higher views, well haters sponsor a lot of views to lovelyz
=
No one can cheer the way oh my girl cheers and hypes for literally every group
=
This performance was AMAZING and I don't care the other opinions!
=
4:17 I  know they are still  suitable for pure songs more than sexy, but  you can't deny on their talent.
=
Wow... this is such a treat for us fans, seeing this side of them, those vocals though  seeing them step out of their usual concept is too much for my heartttt
=
I can't stop listening this cover 
=
No matter how many times I watch this performance, I still love it and kudos to Lovelyz for being brave to cover this song.
=
Esse tiozinho no 4:35 me representa
=
Still loving this to bits
=
Just accept the fact the they are talented! They definitely gave their all in this performance. Haters gonna hate no matter what! LOVELYZ JJANG!! ~
P. S. Even the other groups are acknowledging their talent and vocals. Hope there is more love and acceptance towards LOVELYZ.
=
Brown Eyed Girls feels
=
Thank you Lovelyz. This is very perfect. ❤❤❤❤ You are very talented and beautiful. you have overcome it very nicely
=
I love that on all the videos for round two they keep on zooming in on the same cute security guard
=
New international fan here,I'm curious why I didn't even found an English comment here
=
This kind of concept would suit them better for their next comeback!  they did an amazing job!  Killing vocals, killing raps and of course killing performance!!
=
I didn't even know they did this song!! I really need to watch this show- I'm so glad to see how far the girls have come vocally and performance-wise. I adore seeing them leave the viewers shook. Beautiful
=
0:27 this face when u realize what is boutta happen absolutely SENDS
=
OH MY god
=
When I watch this, I first think "wow they're slaying it" then I wonder why are so many ppl disappointed about this performance. Then after watching the original "Sixth Sense" of B.E.G, I totally understood and officially became a fan of B.E.G.
Also thank u Lovelyz, thanks for letting me know an unknown masterpiece ‍♀️
=
3:46
=
4:18
is it true?
impossible
=
Lovelyz perfect performance
=
4:35
=
Sujeong is just perfect for the Gain part!
=
Kei-pop
=
Why there is so much negativity here!! This is one of Korean’s stupid rampages 
I love lovelyz , and this song suited them ❤️
=
Lovelyz
=
Lovelyz
=
Lovelyz
=
Lovelyz
=
❤❤❤❤
=
I think this is brilliant <3
=
Here’s the English comment you’re looking for.
=
TBH I think this was the BEST peformance during the whole Queendom event. GG
=
4:51
=
3:46
=
2:24?
=
Ugi should keep that hair lol Looks so good
=
4:41 is so satisfying
=
Lovelyz jjang!!
=
THIS IS AMAZING! THE INTRO THO! ONE OF THE BEST! PEIODTTTT!!!!
=
Lack of power in their voices. But it still goods
=
3:45
=
O M G !
=
They did a really good job of making it theirs but I can’t help but wish someone did true whistle note, I always get goosebumps
=
3:46
=
Lovelyz alwayz the best
=
Well, they popped off.
=
Pop pop pop!!!!!
=
I'm loving this performance
=
3:34
=
Idk... It's almost impossible to reach BEG's level of sexiness and power... specially the power. Still great i guess :/
=
Jisoo must be rapper!
=
move onnnnnnn why dont yall watch cameo or moonlight instead
=
Wow I got chills
=
4:17 the moment I officially fell in love with Kei. (don't judge me, I'm fairly new to K-Pop :b)
=
Kei's high note omg she's so stable and her voice is so crystal clear
congrats doll <3
=
*Lovelyz did a decent job but in my opinion, this is not a great song for them. Their voices are the most suitable with girly, pretty and dreamy songs. It would have been amazing if they had chosen to perform 'At the same place' from Produce 101 or IZONE's 'La Vie en Rose'*
=
Am I the only one who thought the first high note was a bit similiar to Angel by Berry Good's high note?
=
Damn good performance✨❤️
=
I love this song
=
Why so many dislikes? :0
=
Please guys, support Brown Eyed Girls comeback  Wonder Woman and Abandoned ❤️
You Will love it
=
Even among our songs (so far), sixth sense is the hardest song for us to manifest. it's a song that certainly difficult to sing live. Lovelyz reinterpreted it and make it remembered, we’re grateful *(Brown Eyed Girls Narsha)*
It's really incredible that the song showed a different Lovelyz! *(Super Junior Heechul)*
*You did well, Lovelyz! Fighting!*
=
BEG REALLY SAID STAN LOVELYZ
=
when beg praised lovelyz today 
antis:
=
Beg said thanks lovelyz  
Thank u to beg and lovelyz, women support women 
haters cant relate!
=
Did anyone notices that Bom subtly dances “Fire” at 4:54?
=
Gracias por un nuevo concepto, ustedes nunca me desepcionan ❤️
=
all of the other groups' videos are ffull with english comment, but this one dosen't LOL. can't understand a bit XD
=
3:39
3:45
=
4:10
=
=
♡
=
I have a Sixth Sense
=
Esta vez se lucieron!!
=
Brilliant job
=
The backing track seems to be quieter possibly to showcase the singing voices and I think I prefer this version by Lovelyz more
=
Babysoul and Jiae nailed this part! 2:54
=
Still good performance 
=
Y'ALL, BROWN EYED GIRLS' COMEBACK IS ON OCTOBER 28, MONDAY, 6PM KST!!!
=
Jangan khawatir, ini komentar bahasa indonesia yang kalian cari
=
I'm watching this after cameo's stage and I'm wondering if they are the same backdancers
=
3:46
=
Kei and Jisoo did really good in this one ~
=
My fav part 3:48
I'm so newbie as  her fan
=
Iconic
=
Wow!! Their vocal really stable, even it is their first time to challenge themselves to do a powerful song. That's why they are confidence with their voices...
=
Me pregunto con que nos sorprenderán mañana otra vez <3
=
Original song: Pa-ap!! 
 Kei: Pa~ap❤
=
Long live Lovelyz 
=
That guy’s face says it all  mesmerizing
=
What's the name of the show ?
=
0:28 she look like a anime girl
=
17k unlikewhy u so bad with lovelyz?I can't understand 
=
Sujeong, Mijoo and Jisoo really stood out to me! They did great! Yein's expressions are also on point.
=
I absolutely adore Mijoo in this performance
=
1:37 can someone tell me her name? She’s so pretty
Edit: I think her name is Mijoo?
=
3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46 3:46
=
4:17
=
The fact that everyone sleeps on this annoys me
=
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it's longer!
=
Stan Lovelyz ♥️
=
OMG I MISS THESE CLASSIC SONGS Brown Eyed Girls
all these performances are top notch I don't even care about the competition I'm here to support everyone lol
=
Kpop? More like kei-pop


BTW Thank you for the 23 likes, this is the most likes i ever had!
=
Lovelyz
=
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
Love it
=
ARGH. I WAN'T THEM TO HAVE A COMEBACK WITH THIS KIND OF SEXINESS AND POWERFULL SONG! ❤❤❤❤❤
=
pero si hicieron la actuación bien ,¿ porqué han recibido tantos comentarios negativos ?
=
An entire month later, and so many of you continue to mock Lovelyz over something as trivial as a song cover. The performance wasn't great and constructive criticism is a good thing, but how is calling for Lovelyz to disband constructive? How is calling them talentless and ugly constructive? How is saying that they're undeserving of their own song constructive? How is endlessly posting "Pop~! ❤" in all of Lovelyz's articles and videos constructive? It's just bullying at this point, and it's gross.
These girls didn't do anything ACTUALLY wrong. They didn't bully or hurt anybody, do drugs, or illegally gamble. Their record has been spotless for 5 years now. A couple of spotty performances on an Mnet reality show doesn't deserve this kind of vitriol. C'mon, you guys!
If anything, Korea should be proud about having a group like Lovelyz. They're talented, kind-hearted, and their music is so, so good. Did you know that their lyrics contain hardly any English words? Because of that, the beauty of the Korean language is displayed wonderfully! Did you know that all of their songs are composed by Korean composers? In a world where so much of K-pop is composed by foreign songwriters, that's awesome! Did you know that Lovelyz is the only girl group to have a song composed by the fantastic Humming Urban Stereo? That's just really cool to me! Did you know that Michael Jackson's producer, Brent Fischer, acknowledged their talents by wanting to work with them? That speaks for itself!
Please, please stop the endless condemnation, and stop dressing it up as "criticism." It's truly getting too excessive.
=
I dunno why.. but i just love this performance. I'm not a Lovelyz fan, but I love this performance. I keep coming back here to watch this. No matter what others say, fighting Lovelyz!! 
=
Time to stan lovelyz. That was an amazing performance (and i am obsessed with this cover)
=
I really love this performance... I thought oh my girl and Lovelyz did the worst on week 1 but the best on week 2 [this week]. I think what they could have improved on was...
- darker makeup on everyone
- less falsetto and deeper powerful POP
- not sure why Jiae is still using her cute voice because we’ve heard her deep beautiful voice which she should have used in this song.
Jisoo really did the best in this concept which surprised me because I’ve always thought Mijoo was too sexy to be in Lovelyz but even Jisoo seemed to be into it and sexier than Mijoo in this perf. Maybe because Mijoo is injured? Regardless... that Kei’s note was orgasmic 
=
I actually like this cover lol. I think queendom all have good covers. I like the high notes from that one girl at the end.
=
"Gracias"
=
the one who hit the high note, who is she?
=
Awesomeeeee
=
I think Lovelyz has proved that they can be sexy and mature the right way than what they did to AHCHOO but I do hope they do what they did with once open a time and do cute but mature
=
You cannot compare the original with this cover. I think they did justice to this song. I bet not many idol group want to cover this song as this song have many high notes.
=
Please support Brown Eyed Girls comeback  Wonder Woman and Abandoned ❤️
=
Yea, keep hating these hard working and humble girls. Yesterday you cried, but tomorrow you will keep hating on people without any reason, as always. Then, you will regret and forget. This is so unfair ...
=
Am I the only one that though JIN was a random white girl at first? 
=
All the love and respect for these Brave and beautiful ladies❤❤❤❤... Even though I'm not a fan, but they really are talented and gorgeous... All the best ....  #RIPSULLI
=
Lovelyz is my one and only precious girl group, only them that matter to me. I wont tolerate any haters who trying to degrading and trolled them. Lovelinus will always protect Lovelyz
=
Reading the very recent news of another idol's passing, one of the things that came to mind was this recent controversy with Lovelyz and how people are still coming here to bully them. And the girls literally see this stuff, we know that since a few of them have responded to it. A simple cover of a song... let that sink in. The girls seem strong in their responses but it's clear that they were very hurt. And don't give me that crap that people are just criticizing them, because in my opinion the people who are just criticizing them are also exaggerating the hell out of something so small. I don't get ya'll and this culture of no mercy until someone is dead. Then sadly people still blame the idols or are happy to see them gone. But you know what, some people are going to realize the weight of their words and how it hurts other people deeply. And they're the ones that are gonna have to deal with that.
=
Lovelyz receiving hate criticism from knetz is no joke too! Please protect them :((( they endured so much since debut
=
To all of you that hated on lovelyz FOR WEEKS!..REMEMBER BECAUSE OF YOUR WORDS, PEOPLE LIKE SULLI COMMIT SUICIDE. YOU, ESPECIALLY KOREAN FANS ARE ALWAYS THE REASON. INTERNATIONAL FANS, you are no different.
=
This cover turns 1 month old in 4 days... The fact so many users who claim to hate it are still obsessed with it is quite pathetic... Don't y'all have more interesting things to do? Are y'all THAT bored?
=
Respeto la opinión de los demás, pero para mi es un muy buen cover Lovelyz es genial 
=
3:46
=
Wow from knetz comments they made it sound like this was an utterly terrible performance but it's good?!
Btw, Jisoo killed this!
=
are they our lovely "Lovelyz"?  wow they grow up, I've never seen them like this.  iknow them with pure and inocent girl and now they grow up, they try to something new they haven't tried.  enthusiasm for you, even though there are many who curse you, don't give up easily.^^
=
i think the problem here was that kei struggled to hit the note at "pop" with strength in her voice, it sounds floaty to me, and also that lovelyz, given their usual style, can't bring out the same guttural timbre that BEG can. I still love this version a lot tho, it may even be better than the original if one of them can hit the "pop" with enough strength. Lovelyz fighting!
=
how can my girls be this great  i dont deserve y'all but pLEASE LET ME LOVE YOUUUU
=
If they sang PoP part together it could ve been much more powerful and performance couldve been complete. But overall not bad at all. Beg is just too powerfull
=
Did they really have THREE vocalists hit that note in their head voice???? Wow that is so impressive!
=
Jisoo is not joking, she slay hard!
=
After hear about sulli i can't stop worrying about lovelyz too. Everyone who still left hate comments please think twice. Idols are also human too. They also might get hurt by your hate comments. I'm okay with criticism. But you can write your criticism with nice words right? Please comment with good manner. I believe you guys are good people
=
3:46
=
tbh, why kei hitting that "pop" with falsetto? if only babysoul and jin did all the "pop" part, it would be much stronger, just saying.
=
*does anyone here are aware of how hate/nega comments affects idol?? damn, if ever one of my babies in lovelyz just do the same way of what sulli did, I will not think twice to bombarded all those people. Yall it's still not too late to change, be a human that's responsible enough to their shits. May Sulli's soul rest in peace. . I give my deepest condolence to all her family, friends and fans, and face this more stronger.*
=
Tangina nung mga dislikers HAHAHAHAH mga bitter hindi kayo mahal ng magulang nyo, magtrabaho nalang kayo na sagayon may silbi kayo HAAHHAHAHAHA WALANG MGA BEBE
=
"kei-pop"
=
4:17
=
who's the one with the short hair?
=
Lovelyz always do different things .. that's what I like about them
=
wow amazing 
=
This is actually insane, I heard this song today and now I'm a bias for this group. I like it!!!
=
Jisoo really- AAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAaaAaaAAA
=
I think they should change their group concept. They can go with girl crush concept so well. I think 
=
What the hell with the dislikes ??? Lovelyz will be always criticized no matter what... They are talented, they are charismatic, they are always trying their best. You are so unfair. Anyways, I'm so proud of my girls, keep doing like that !!
=
Esta canción me sorprendió...me encanto las notas altas de kei ❤❤❤❤
=
Mijoo is so sexy
=
Don't worry I am the english comment you are looking for
=
It's not as bad as I expected from what I heard, but the "pop" part was a little weird...aside from that though it wasn't too terrible, they obviously don't sound as strong as BEG, but this is their take on it. Unless their challenge was to like directly mimic the original group??
=
I love Queendom. I get to see amazing idols cover amazing songs. No hate but Lovelyz did a better job than I thought they would. Those high notes though. Keep going Lovelyz!
=
Babysoul >Jin>Kei
Agree?
=
lovelyz were really good.
=
This is my favorite song from brown eyed girls and i need to see people hyping this up!!!
=
This reminded me of newborn kittens
=
You all sleep on BabySoul voice here.
She's absolutely amazing.
Soul, you're truly the best, thanks for that!
=
well, i appreciate that they had the guts to perform a BEG song but man, they should've just picked brave new world or kill bill because sixth sense is a grim song that really carries a deep meaning and it heavily relies on the singers power to communicate the message and lovelyz just very much completely missed it's point :( like technically this was not a bad performance, they have good vocalists and good dancers and their rapper is amazing but to be honest, this just ain't it, chef. 
i applaud them for being brave enough to leave their comfort zone like this but when you're on competition like this, you just have to be aware of your skillset
=
At 4:37, since they did not go for the whistle note, I wish they had some some epic harmonies. Lovelyz is very good at harmonizing and it would have gone with their theme. Missed opportunity in my opinion :(
=
came to read some comments...

after scrolling...

me: *hmmmmm* let's just focus on the video
=
Omg
=
I crave Mijoo confidence. She embraces her goofines and beauty. This group has a.l lot of energy. Poor manager 
=
Rather than saying it was cute, I think this performance is more youthful and refreshing. I can imagine watching this stage when I'm feeling down and leaving with my spirits lifted and a smile on my face. Their energy is as infectious as always, which is why I love lovelyz and have been a fan since pre-debut. You did well girls! Ignore those haters and be confident in all the stages you put out, all of them were good.
=
This concept really suits Lovelyz the most. Don’t get me wrong, this concept seems easy but it’s really difficult to keep up and maintain the concept for years. Their loveliness just can’t be copycat
=
omg why do i feel like tearing up seeing everyone fangirling over them, and the 'this is the thing only lovelyz can do' awhh
=
Let’s be honest this was probably lovelyz best stage since queendom started and I’m in love with it I love how they can pull of this concept and just make is extraordinary
=
this song *cameo* and their new released song *moonlight* , is like a connected story. in cameo theyre sad that they cant be the main character, in moonlight they want to be free from the story. and also, both reminds me of kdrama *extraordinary you* that im watching currently, baekyung :(( pls give him a happy ending
=
People disliked this because they hate the sad ending. That guy didn't choose lovelyz and people are mad!
=
EXTRAORDINARY YOU FANS WILL APPRECIATE THIS SONG FOR SURE...
=
this is more than a cute concept - its storytelling, like a musical, it really suits them!!!
=
still trending, and let haters watch and realize who is Lovelyz
=
This song need a stable breath, its so hard to sing this even when you’re standing still. Uri lovelyz did really well!❤️
=
I LOST IT WHEN JIMIN ANSWERED IMMEDIATELY "MIJOO PROBABLY" @ WHOMEVER YELLED "EVERYBODY SCREAM" 
EVEN JIMIN KNOWS JUST HOW EXTRA MIJOO IS
=
Just look at the smiles on the live audience's faces.  Lovelyz definitely got new fans not only in that room but worldwide.
=
The little Korean caption at 1:04 says “Mom Clapping” and hoNESTLY
=
i like the way they dont try hard to be like everyone..they being their self.tbh this is the best from the other..
=
Im a miracle, but honestly i think lovelyz's performance was the best out of all 6 in this round. I really enjoyed the glee/high school musical-like concept!! the girls managed to nail this and got me smiling from start to end!!! Love love love!! <33 thank you girls! lovelyz are indeed lovely
=
I kinda wish youtube can translate other language cuz this comment section got too many hangul and I dead curious to know what they say....
=
This is pure gold, it’s so refreshing. I bursted out laughing cuz only at the ending I understood why it’s called cameo Hahahaha
=
For me they deserve 1st place for this performance. Its really hard to pull of musical performance with all the props, story plot, face expression, timing & etc. Love itt
=
This really is something only lovelyz can do like this
=
it’s funny how no group in queendom has done a cute concept except lovelyz lmao. i really don’t get the hype around girl crush concepts and the hate around cute concepts-
=
this is my favorite song from lovelyz ❤
=
They have their own unique (amazing cuteness). They are different from other girlgrup. Why are people still sleeping on their great talent?
=
THEY TURN THE WHOLE DAMN STUDIO INTO A MUSIC VIDEO
=
I feel like this is all I wanted from Lovelyz all Queendom and they finally gave it to us.
=
So many idols got inspired from this kind of concept..i am proud of Lovelyz
=
Feels like watching Lovelyz’s concert. This is perfection!
=
I really really love how LOVELYZ didn't need to perform this song far from their original concept so that they can fit to others' taste. They nailed their performance effortless because they're just being them. Let other groups cover their songs but I SWEAR, only them can pull it off!!!
=
remember when lovelyz invented musicals ❤️❤️❤️
=
looks like a mv
=
This felt like a comeback all until the drums picked up holy shit
=
THAT “NOOOO” PART IN 5:00 IS A MOOD HAHAHAHHAA
=
This song make me happy :D
Good vibes and really cute aaaa kiyowoo
=
I just realised the guy chose the cameo (background dancer) over the leads (lovelyz), shookt lmao
=
Tbh I was excited and flustered by this performance because it was so refreshing and overloaded by cuteness! I was in dilemma to choose between mamamoo, lovelyz and oh my girl!
=
How refreshing to see Lovelyz performing Cameo again. I really miss their old concept and long haired banged Sujeong lol
=
Lovelyz ❤️
=
this musical of lovelyz make me feel so much emotion
=
THIS NEEDS MORE VIEWS!
THEY NEED TO BE PROTECTED!
Whether others like it or not, I know I did and so did the Koreans because they adore cute concepts!
=
Outstanding performance from an outstanding group
=
Lovelyz is one of the super underrated groups like they're scaringly talented
=
Wow!!! Best performance I have seen this year, soooooo lovely!!
=
Mijoo is making me love this group omg
=
MIJOO DESERVES THE WORLD
=
I keep coming back to this performance uwu. I cant help but smile all throughout the video. It really feels like a musical and the ending is very musical like omygod i loveLyz haha
=
Now I understand why Sunggyu named them Lovelyz.
=
They are  just perfectlyz♡
=
Mijoo is so funny
=
These girls started as cute highschoolers ( Candy Jelly Love ) to beautiful elegant ladies ( Beautiful Days ) and i'm not complaining about it. By this time they basically own the concept. Like Soyeon said, this is the concept that only Lovelyz can do. They already stepped out of their comfort zone (Sixth Sense) and i'm happy for them
=
jiae is so cute
=
1:03 I think Jimin would have wanted to be a part of it.  XD
=
Aoa like lovelyz proud eomma 
=
Jimin being a reaction queen is the best
=
i automatically smile when sujeong starts to sing, btw hope that Woolim promotes Lovelyz better
=
Lovelyz color can’t be replicated
=
We also need the english sub for the song in the caption, please! Because this story has a storyline,
=
Lovelyz is bunch of nice, humble and hardworking girls. They're one of the best happened in kpop. We'll protect them till the end
=
Jangjun, is that you in the intro?! 
=
I enjoy watching it again and again!
=
they always see Lovelyz as an easy target so they keep on down voting them, even knetz, they down vote positive comments about Lovelyz tsktsk
=
They live up their name Lovelyz  thanks to lovelyz my everyday life are freshen up by them! 
=
Finally lovelyz stepped up their game! This is their best performance on this show! :D
=
Golden Child's Jangjun narrates the intro
=
#31 trending in korea yt
=
This stage brings joy and smile.... Please check your heart if u cant smile or enjoying this stage, there must be something wrong with your heart xoxo
=
I wish i had a classmate like Yein 
=
And i fallin with eonnideul again:'
=
I really wish they win this round
=
The intro reminds me of Girl's Day's Darling (male voice). 
=
For me, Mijoo (?) Is one of the prettiest i've seen in kpop industry, i really like her visual and she is also talented and funny
=
i cant stop coming back to this!!! best performance on queendom
=
Jin is honestly so cute with that whole appearance
=
Lovelyz proving that soft, cute, fresh, u name it, is still relevant 
=
Credit to that male lead who managed not to laugh on stage the whole time
=
Lovelyz♡
=
So this is award show content material.... Thanks lovelyz 
=
babysoul will be 29 next year. you're welcome.
=
Everytime I need instan mood and spirit booster I watch this Lol
=
3:57  who was that
=
Lovelyz  performance deserve   in pitch perfect  movie.  Musical, angelic  voice and song so good.
=
lovelyz knows how to pull off the innocent/lovely concepy AND IT SHOWS
edit: im crying
=
Mijoo you make me laugh, oh my god 
=
THIS'S AMAZING OUR CUTYYYY LOVELYZ
=
This was so good, the best stage on round 3
=

=
LAS AMO LOVELYZ. FIGHTING 
=
It makes me think of extraordinary you
=
Can't stop watching it.. I so love them ❤❤❤
=
Sujeong ❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
Lovelyz queen is served
=
I know everybody talked about this in every videos of queendom, but Solar face's always hilarious for me lol
=
Jin's highnote is the best in Lovelyz. At least for me 
=
Slayed it periodt
=
Mijoo will always be so extra 
=
chorus kinda reminds me of apink nono ngl HAHAHA LITERALLY SUCH A NICE SONG
=
Hwasa’s expression is so cute at 1.19, it’s basically telling” kei, don’t cheat me with that harmless cutiepie face. I know you as the enthusiastic non stop n scared me a lot girl”. Hhx so cuteeeee
=
Mijoo, u are so extra!! ‍♂️‍♀️
=
I keep coming back to re watch this! It’s such a lovely performance
=
Perfeição define esse musical ❤
=
LOVELYZ FIGHTING
=
Not being biased but this is the best performance in Queendom, they did a great performance effortlessly.
=
That last line mijoo said 
=
LOVELYZ So Cute
=
Ive missed the live performances for this track 
Jimin saying cute is a whole mood 
=
I wish they perform all their stages for their concert !!!!
=
this was definitely my fave performance by lovelyz <3 really reallyyy goood

Ps. i think mijoo literally took my heart HAHA
=

I just cried through the whole performance... Knowing the translation of the song, I can't help but to think of Lovelyz's hardships from the start. You did well our babies! T^T

I GOT GOOSEBUMPS SINCE INTRO UNTIL ENDING AND DO YOU HEAR THAT VERY LOUD CHEERS IN THE END? THATS ME OMG I LOVE LOVELYZ MORE AND MORE
=
Bien hermosas todas 
=
Solo tu mijoooo ❤️
=
太ってる子がかわいい
=
They shouldn't try to become someone. They are just be themselves. Lovelyz is so lovely.
=
MIJOO BEING EXTRA IS A MOOD. HAHAHAHAHA. They all looked cute.
=
The smile in everyone's face says it all.....such a lovely performance
=
I really love the cuteness overload  and how the girls support each other. 
=
Musical stage always amazed me bcoz of the difficulties like you gotta dance, singing, expression with storyline and you have to make moving changes in very shortime. I finally can see one in Queendom, the best one by Lovelyz
=
mijoo : make some noise *mijoo cracked  style best part 
me : shocked by drink water 
=
LOVELYZ♡
=
Why did Mnet didn't gave  reactions about the ending??  SO HILARIOUS!
=
This is the thing that other groups doesn't have
=
Is it just me but I'm getting La La Land vibes in this performance , especially the beginning!
=
STAN ANGELS STAN LOVELYZ
=
LOVELYZ FIGHTING
=
Yein!!  0:26
=
But Jisoo with the pants!! 
=
LOVELYZ FIGHTING
=
HEY!
=
I’m in love for the 1000000000000000000.... time again❤️❤️❤️
=
Mijoo’s vocal cords gonna feel that in the morning.
=
Jimin fangirling is a mood
=
QUEENLYZ
=
I FEEL SO HAPPY WATCHING LOVELINUS SINGING THE SONG IN THE PUBLIC, THIS STAGE IS AMAZING, LOVELINUS NATION WON AGAIN!!
=
I thought and wish they win actually
=
4:00 my favourite part
=
i cannot get over how stunning this scene was at 3:10!!! jisoo is such a visual goddess!!!!!!
=
Awwnn i really love their stage
=
Jin and Kei look SOOOOO CUTEEE
=
"Queen" is no need to be girl crush or sexy.
=
Lovelyz is group that  late to apreciate by people.
1st Ahchoo booming when they finish promotion.
2nd Twinkle being viral after 1 year.
3rd Cameo their B-side track at 2017 suddenly trending.
But the good things is  better to late than never.
=
Mijoo's many screams on stage was a mood
=
*SCREAMS*
Every gg on queendom:....
...
..
"That must be Mijoo"
=
This is such a fun performance and mijoo make it more fun
=
Their group name suits them
*Lovely* 
I think no one can do this concept better than them
=
This was freaking adorable! They slayed this musical concept!
=
Omg this song really fits Extraordinary You Lovelyz is sooo cute
=
Soul is so cute with specs♥️❤️♥️❤️
=
this is my fave stage for this episode❤❤❤❤❤
=
Omg! I smiled throughout the whole video and Mijoo made my day  plus Mijoo's andwae made me wanna see other groups' reaction 
=
Mijoo 
=
they're indeed lovelyz. just wow
=
Lovelyz is the best
=
This song seriously has to be their comeback song
=
lovelyz should have won this round with this performance imo
=
I love Mijoo unnie 
=
This performance is such a mood booster. I think if anyone of you feel down, watch this video instead.
=
The show will come to an end
And i want to tell you
Honestly LOVELYZ is one of the best group for dance and sing in 3rd gen.. (especially in this show)
For dance, they are superior tbh  you could see in unit performance even they just send their lead dancer yein, she already slay it..
And for vocals, i think they are the best after mamamoo(maybe)
We know that both of the groups are known for their accapela.. and it depends on your preference who is better.. with me i really love lovelyz tone.. and kei know how to sing(i mean great technique) with jin and babysoul tone too.. n sujeong.. the groups fill with great vocalist.. mijoo and yein too could pass as lead vocal..
Its that people still dont recognize their talent..
And its so frustating! Really. 
But i kniw that one day lovelyz won't be the CAMEO and become the MAIN CHARACTER.. 
Okay thats are my HONEST opinion..
Have a good day guyss..
And for haters hope you have a good day too but pls keep streaming.. and pls streaming MOONLIGHT too ☠
=
YASSS LOVE THIS SO MUCH. see this is what happens when you do something you truly excel at. Their last performance was unfortunate but they really redeemed themselves with this stage. They're not lovelyz for nothing. The stage was lovely and sweet and everything nice. I'm glad they ended the show with a bang. 10/10 stage i love it so much
=
maybe its because i had a bad day so i wasn't really feeling it but then Mijoo screamed and im a lil happy now ☺
=
Istg my heart did a thing when i saw yein wear glasses with that hairstyles
=
I reallyyyyyy love this performance♡
=
I've always thought of keeping these 8 angels in a whole different n beautiful universe where cruelties n injustice are unexistent n they're th queens in tht kingdom .. THIS is why! They make me so happy, effortlessly
=
REALLY ENJOY AND FUN WATCHING THIS PERFORMANCE~^^
=
This is something only lovelyz can do! RIGHT RIGHT HUU
=
That Mijoo's cracked scream though
=
5:00 my lovely part
=
1M let's get it
=
Bauty and lovely, Lovelyz 
I love them
=
看了心情很好，會一直重播
=
Who else Cant stop watching?
=
I need all of them to be in MAMA 2019
=
I can't believe how Kei and Hwasa are the same age but they have different auras!! Kei has a child-like face while Hwasa is just a total woman. I like both a loooot
=
This makes me happy. I'm not saying that Lovelyz should stick to cutesy concept but it's like the cute, wholesome and positive vibe they give off is not just a concept. It is them. They all have this innate ability to create this atmosphere because they're like that in real life, at least from what I observe but do you get what I mean? Lol. They're so natural and this makes anyone who watches them happy. You know, like they were born to be that lovely only for Lovelyz. I didn't even expect to like them while watching this show but they just kind of grow on me. I love them now. Lol.
=
WHAT WEE NEED? 
THIS
WHY? 
JIN'S HIGHNOTE
=
So, is this Lovelyz in Winterland concert spoiler? In Queendom? The stage presence is out of this world, please spread this video to make people and the world smile because of the loveliness of them... 
=
Yesterday, they're trending #5 in Korea, last night #2, and now they still trending #4!! Good job Lovelyz!!
=
4:17 "they are really lovely" 
4:19 soyeon: this is something only lovelyz can do
Thank you soyeon ^^
=
This is the performance we expect from lovelyz, we know they tried to do another concept in other round to show their versatility and capabilities, but their own concept is the best. Their Own concept will never betray them...
=
So funny so lovely !!! So underrated group!! I think im now a lovelinus(? And moonlight is a masterpice
=
WOW still trending #4 in Korea
Pls this time i hope everyone help streaming 
=
Damn soyeon. Her comment is so true. This kind of performance was lovelyz true strength
=
Not a hater of Lovelyz but they finally perform their own color and genre on Queendom. They deserve it
=
Lovelyz deserve love♡
=
Nice one Lovelyz this is the concept that I have waiting for.. The concet that Lovelyz will give you 100% satisfaction 
=
so that's jangjun voice huh
=
I pround of QUEENLYZ!!!! ✨
=
THEY'RE GIVING ME HIGHSCHOOL MUSICAL VIBES!!!
=
I LOVE THEM I LOVE THEM OOO I LOOOVEE THEEEMM!!
=
look at those 1k bitter eggs
=
Hyejeong's reactions are gold
=
I'm crying on this performance. I like this bside a lot and i've watched all their performance with it. Seeing it being performed this way made me all teary and proud. I've been a lovelinus ever since debut and I can say that they grew a lot.
=
I think this style suits them best!
=
JIMIN IS ME
=
ほんとうに楽しい。何度も見てしまう。
ミジュの他に、踊りのうまい子（バレー？の子）と歌のうまい子（ママムーと歌った子）を覚えた。
=
I love them so much my lovely Queenz
=
wow wow, this show is so goooooood. !!!!!!!
=
fue una obra teatral divertidamente montada por LOVELYZ cameo fue hermoso cada una con supapel kei con su aegyo ento do su expledor el final me parecio muy divertido
=
3:56
=
My lovely queens
=
For people who liked the song, they have many songs like this. Check out hide and seek and the (yes, 'the' is the title). Let's go lovelyz comeback fighting! 
Ps:Trending #2 in yt korea, I'm crying 
=
This was so amazing! They did so well! The Mijoo's scream haha I love her 
=
かわいいいい❤
=
Is the show ending? They didn't even get to show everything they've got. They showed just 10% of what they can do.
=
MIJOO AT THE END  HAHAHAHAHA
=
This is such a fun performance they manage to have my attention through out the whole performance
=
they're cute my heart explored
=
Mijooo whyy 
=
To Lovelyz : it is okay to be Cameo, u’re doing really well. I always lovin u girls 
=
Jimin screaming 'It's cute', and that caption, sends me 
=
*I can just watch this all day long*
=
3:45 - HAHAHA this Mijoo..
Always legendary on every performance LOL
=
THIS IS LITERALLY WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT LOVELYZ DOES THE CUTE CONCEPT BEST. Like I know they've been trying the girl crush route the last 2 performances and it def didn't work in their favor so I'm glad they decided to go with cute concept this time. Like I'm a lesbian and of course girl crush feeds my gay ass pretty well but like I got into kpop because idk there's just something about listening to cutesy music while you walk around with an emo and dark face. It just has a calming and happy effect on my soul so anyone who hates cutesy concept is welcome to leave. I'm sure their ranking would be better this time around with this concept!!! I'm cheering you on Lovelyz!!!
=
Lmao the voice crack was hilarious and the last scene was really good she’s a good actor
=
Pls eng subs mnet cameo is so sad 
=
Hahahaha I can't with Mijoo! 
=
I'm so proud of lovelyz!
We got hurt from this show but at least we got a happy ending.
I don't know why I'm crying but I'm happy finally they got good reactions from korea now.  Woollim better not mess this up again. I can't wait for their comeback ^^ and this song was chosen by the fans right? Of course our beloved btracks that deserve to be a title track, idk about everyone who wants darklyz but I love them like this. Songs that sound happy but the lyrics are sad, such as hide and seek ❤

Ps: Soul is so cute!
=
Jimin and soyeon's reaction tho 
=
Im sorrry but Lovelyz voice can only sing certain songs but when it fit their vocal and visual, they shines so much
=
so fresh to see this performance
=
High school musical ! 
=
This song might look cutesy and bubbly, but try to look at the lyrics its actually saddening.

Do you know my name? I’m a cameo
Whenever I see the shining you, it hurts so much
I could be good too
But my desire to be good gets ahead of me
One two three four
five six seven eight
Only NGs keep increasing

Even though I’m timid
I want to receive your spotlight
Next episode, next episode
I see the end, what do I do?

When will I start being natural?
Scene number
One two three four
five six seven eight
It’s been a while
When will you recognize me?
I feel like the ending will come like this
I feel so anxious
=
cuuuuuuuuute！！！！！！
=
I can’t stop smiling
=
Since their Ah Choo performance, I really glad that they try to do girl crush concept, sexy and strong... and now, we get to see Lovelyz original colour again. Even Mijoo surprise me with her screaming (well we can't say anything about that because real Lovelinus should know how our Mijoo is), but I am glad that they are back and slay their true colour.  
I love you Lovelyz, even you did not win this Queendom or whatever, just know that you are always number 1 in my heart and of course Lovelinus's heart too~
=
Great job Lovelyz 
=
Soyeon = Its only lovelyz can do
Hehe
=
3:45
=
Lol Jimin. 
=
Lovelyz did an amazing job. They really executed what they were pros at. Soyeon was right that everyone was waiting for this side of them to come out. ❤️
=
aku rasa disini lovelyz yang paling profesional karena mereka mencoba semua konsep berbeda diantara konstestan lain yg tetep stay di zona amannya dengan konsep strong dan sexy disini lovelyz sudah coba berbagai macam konsep dari sexy strong innocent sampe cute bahkan konsep drama musical juga di ambil sama lovelyz sayangnya banyak yg gak buka mata sama talennya Lovelyz
=
i really like how sujeong drag Jin back and Jin is freakin Cute..
=
I was touched for what did soyeon said...that this is only lovelyz can do
=
Still trending no.2 ♡♡♡
=
My favorite this episode
=
cant stop watching this
=
this is really their color
=
watching this stage makes me smile without realizing it
=
this is definitely my favorite performance of yesterday's episode
=
People dare to say they are lipsync.. OH MY the clownery 
=
OMG BABYSOUL DAMN CUTE
=
I seriously CANNOT with Mijoo 
=
KEI IS SO CUTE AT 1:16 
SWINGING HER HEAD AND FOOT LIKE THAT ❤❤❤
=
The 980 people who disliked this video must be very very bored with their lives.
=
Lovelyz soooooooo lovely
=
The happy face of the audience  indeed lovely  go lovelyz
=
Honestly this is their best performance on Queendom compared to the last two.
=
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
LOL everyone "who was that"
"probably mijoo"
=
this is so underrated.. no one talked about this perf. all i heard was gidle
this is actually so good and i dont even stan them.. this is one of my favorites among the others along with mamamoo’s!
=
underrated. definitely one of the best final round songs
=
they literally are the most underrated in the show, and they deserve moreee
=
Not a fan but this is, in my opinion, the best finale song.
=
Lion, and destiny is a good song but this is just my style, like it so much, i hope lovelyz comeback with the kind of song
=
I was most impressed with Lovelyz during this show. Not only did they break out and try different styles and genre's, but they slayed while doing it. They didn't care about the criticism and decided to showcase new and different sides of themselves. They definitely branched out the most and challenged themselves the most out of all the groups. I'm so proud of them! The deserve the best. And this song is KILLER!!!!
=
Why baby soul is not famous? Why is she underrated? She has great vocal..
=
Other people dont come here surely bcos they're scare of being amaze by lovelyz and cant stop replaying this song. They must be afraid to admit that lovelyz is good
=
You all can say that other songs are better and deserve to win, but this song and performance is the one that I keep coming back to the most. 

Edit: Still coming here almost everyday since!
=
Lion and Destiny was wild but Moonlight is stuck in my mind right now
=
They did gain  fan through this show but still underrated cuz people only focus on their fav group. The least views among others. Coming from a moomoo.
=
They should wear shoes while dancing on the cold hard ground.  Jin is very beautiful.
=
I know people wanting moonlight to have an mv but can we at least get this performance a million views first?
=
What a way to flex those vocals. There are like 4 members switching the hard parts and they all have strong vocals. Like whattttt
=
Lovelyz really came on this show and showed the whole world who they really are. Woolim take notes this is who lovelyz truly are.
=
i'm not even lovelyz's fan but when i first heard this song, this shock me up, i really fallin in love with this song, can i join the fandom?
=
Even though lovelyz was so underrated during the show. This comeback is the one I listen to the most (besides AOA's sorry) that every time I hear it theres just something so mesmerizing.
=
I wonder when will they become popular.. not underrated
=
They didn’t even need some dance breaks or other stuff because their song already slayed this performance.
=
I become Lovelinus after Queendom.
=
I never heard Lovelyz before the show but this actually was my favorite song among all the final songs. 
Lovelyz have amazing vocals!
=
Im totally fall for Jin. She looks extraordinary gorgeous sexy. That wet look hair tho n facial expression..sooo damn sexy.
=
AOA AND LOVELYZ are the biggest surprise in this show
=
imma hardcore moomoo but idk why i like this song the most
=
Other people don't come to this video must be because they don't know this song is good af!
=
I'm surprised every performer had a decent song in a Mnet final
=
I like lovelyz's performance the most in the final round
=
the "i've got only me" line HITS HARD
=
I'm in love with this song 
I can't spend a day without listening to this masterpiece
=
this song shows how great the vocal line is. I really love the voice of babysoul here
=
Their voices  the song  this is really my favorite song of all queendom songs  this is coming from a neutral person
=
I really like their innocent concept, but I think this type of concept suit them better, as well their ages! Lovelyz fighting <3
=
I like this song
  Their Dance and Voice is the masterpiece
I can not forget their song
They are very good 
Their performance is the perfect
They are very very full talanted
Fighting
=
Can MAMA invite groups like lovelyz and oh my girl to perform atleast.
=
I love how the final songs of each group still has their own touch. This song is eerie, magical and melancholic just like all Lovelyz songs. Like a mix of the melancholy of Destiny plus the upbeat yet sad lyrics of That Day.
=
why the views are so low . these need a million views they're so good
=
Kei did great. We got to see her other side.Sujeong high note is impressive.she has power in her voice.Babysoul high note after chorus is also good.Jin also fit this concept
=
I hope next comeback lovelyz will popular more than.
=
I hope woolim will make a music video for this.
=
Sujeong's voice is so nice and Jisoo is so gorgeous
=
Jin totally snaps!
=
Yein and Jisoo stood out the most. Those visuals
=
So underrated bop!!!! This was an epic song !!! Im neverland ... A loveland
=
Dear woollim : i need the MV of this song.
=
To be honest, the song didn't catch my attention when I was watching the final episode. But it grew on me and I've been replaying it so many times now! Lovelyz fighting!
=
The people who disliked this probably thought it means "dis I like"
=
This is such a good song tht deserves to be appreciated 
=
We need MV for this song❤️❤️
=
Kei is so gorgeous!!! I became a fan since Queendom. Fighting Lovelyz!!!
=
Lovelyz performed this with confidence. Its like they're screaming to the world that they don't need a man or anyone anymore as they already found theirselves.
=
That feeling that i need to come here again for the nth time because it keeps on playing in my head.
=
its a really great song!! i think with lovelyz they dont intend to win first, they just want more recognition for their group, to show everyone they have what it takes and i feel theyve definitely done that!! they are definitely not just good at being a cutesy girl group
=
I think other Queendom performance were really good but THIS song catch me!  This is my favorite song 
=
I dont even want a mv..but can we got a dance practice?. Theres no reason to woollim to not released a dance practice. Its lovelyz's original song, so woollim shouldnt afraid about copyrights.
=
moonlight is the best from all of qd' song for me, the most catchy, just missing middle east instrument in between
=
Going out and slaying when you are the fan favorites is one thing. But giving your 100% when you know your group is in the bottom rankings, your company didn't invest as much fancy flashy effects, and all your preformances have been critizised to death is much harder. This preformance is #1 in my heart ❤
=
Ma lovelyz thery are perfect  best song ever 
=
*all* queendom groups need to have a special stage at mama,,, it would be absolutely a m a z i n g
=
Oof can i really be honest i came to queendom cuz of mamamoo and i discovered lovelyz they are so underrated asf
=
i really love lovelyz music and art
=
This stage showcase everything, visual, vocal, dance and the song so catchy and lit. Everything on point. Lovelyz not underrated in korea they just under-appreciated. Glad they're just keep rising after queendom
=
Don’t know why I keep coming back for this song. But tbh, I think other Lovelyz’s are better. I just like their uniqueness in their songs. The latest obsession is Temptation haha
=
if lovelyz start doing dark concepts its gonna be the death of us
=
I’d like to see Jin’s blonde hair for 3 comebacks at least
=
YAAASHHH MY VOCAL QUEEN IS NUMBER 1 IN MY HEART
=
MY GAHD!!!! I NEED LOVELYZ IN MY LIFE!
=
Please, let lovelyz comeback with like this consep
=
myungeun fits every concept very well  i love her
=
This song is really good, maybe this song is my favorite in lovelyz song :) 
I always waiting for the new song :v Fighting
=
I love JIN'S part very much. Hahah dont know why.
=
All final songs are equally good. Lovelyz performance is amazing and their vocals sooo good. I'm a fan of Kei , yein and sujeong. I think everyone is equally amazing. But I love kei so much. Her voice texture and dancing skills are damn good.
=
this song is best pop in the world,
=
I'VE JUST NOTICED THAT THIS SONG ENDED AT THE INVERSE FORM THAT YEIN'S DANCE PERFORMANCE ALSO ENDS. 
we stand leyend's
=
I love the beginning part so much. It sounds so haunting. Like, a tragic romance. I feel like Lovelyz suits haunting concepts so much, which obviously has been proven with this stage. This stage shows such a different side of Lovelyz that I have been waiting so much from them and they executed it so well. I do hope they'll keep on showing us different sides of them. Especially the haunting concepts because very few idols does it. Especially so hauntingly beautiful like the beginning of this stage here. And I believe Lovelyz will own this concept amazingly. If they ever does it, that is. Aha.
=
Yeah, it’s over I love myself… Now, we must end this, high time to install new leaders and overhauling the existing team (Sunggyu?). There’s less and less principle per se like I said a sad ending is the hopeful beginning because you found yourself. Excited (never exhausted)!!
=
This show how flexible our girls guys. dont mind the haters. They dont want to stick to there own concept here because they want to show there other side and they nailed it.
=
Why the fuckkk the camera had to pan away when Baby Soul sang her part!!!! This is disappointing 
=
All of the other groups reached 1M and more, but Lovelyz are still not close. It's sad, they deserve it I think. But 660k is great too.
=
OMG ARE THESE REALLY LOVELYZ???? THIS SONG IS SOOOO PERFECT I LOVED IT  they worked really hard lets appreciate that
=
I don't know why... But I always cry when I listen to this... 
=
This song is SO GOOD! I love Lovelyz usual graceful and lovely style but they fit this concept too well this time. Mijoo and Jin's parts in the pre chorus is addicting. Also, who gave them the right to look this GOOD?! Jin's short hair being sort of messy at one point really did it for me.
=
Myungeun said on her vlive radio that she likes Yein's "be my own babe, be my own" the most.
=
I’m a fan of them since the beginning and honestly I want them to do this concept so much!!! It still has their colour but at the same time it’s more upbeat and exciting!
=
2:03 Vocal Line
2:09: Visual Line
=
For me myungeun and sujeong really stand out on this performance. All the members were doing great, but when i think about moonlight performances i remember myungeun and sujeong. Especially myungeun wet hair, gosh never expecting myungeun would do this.
=
I love them so much :((
=
This song did justice to baby soul, jin and sujeongs voice the most. Woollim you listening ? Move on from those usual lovelyz concept and do something diff like this for their comeback if you want them to get bigger and dethrone twice ?
=
PEOPLE MUST STAN THESE GIRLS 
=
Im such a hardcore neverland but this song is my second pick after lion. Bop,bye.
=
Beautiful voices and performance aside, I really like the message of this song. A woman finding her true self. A woman can be free without having to compromise her femininity. That's really empowering and meaningful. Good job girls!
=
I never really liked them because i used to think that they can only do one concept but this song and performance is just magnificent. It’s the best song for me from the finale and that’s a big deal for me being a total Mamamoo and Oh My Girl stanner. The lyrics are just cool and foreboding. The choreography is elegant. The outfits are stunning and the girls gave it a 100%.
=
To the one who's reading this, thank you very much for loving LOVELYZ...
=
Lovelyz did good they challenged different concepts throughout the program and lovelinus are thankful for that I hope that woollim will give them a comeback with a good budget and add this song in the album, even the dance practice woollim please
=
A GROUP WITH 4 MAIN VOCALS AND 4 LEAD VOCALS!!!! WHY WOOLIMMM... PUT SUJEONG INTO THE MAIN VOCAL LINE ALREADYYYYYY!!!
=
i falling in love with Jin !!
=
Best queendom song. I am nonfans of lovelyz and this is so underrated
=
I like how Mijoo, Yein, Jisoo, Jiae's voices are heard enough...The song had good outcome because of well distributed lines. They didn't need to make main and lead vocals to sing almost of the song just to make it powerful...
=
Lovelyz vocals were on point and shining on Moonlight. Soul and Sujeong hight note was killing part
=
I thought it's 13 M already
=
I dont know how many times i play this
=
This song keep growing in me..definitely my top pick..
=
Lovelinus, don't forget to stream SHOOTING STAR too, it is close to 2M views.
=
Queendom showing such a variety of new and fantastical concepts. Oh My Girl's gothic-esque Twilight, AOA's wild west showdown, and now Lovelyz with this utopian, almost Greek-inspired fantasy. I think they all deserve a win. Everyone did amazing!
=
Its actually a LOVELYZ COMEBACK
TEASER SOON
=
This song is really good congrats Lovelyz and Wollim ✨
=
I love MAMAMOO destiny but this song keeps repeating in my head especially the chorus part 
=
Jin is so beautiful with this hair style
=
I'm not a lovelinus but I like this song. It's different than their other songs I've checked out like ah choo, candy jelly love, and lost n found. I hope they will get international recognition from this show because they are pretty underated internationally. And tbh, I used to only know Kei out of the whole group
=
I really liked it (I think it had eurovision vibes :D)
=
Lovelyz did really good this round. I think all of their stage so far is ok except the units did good. I really like this performance. Beautiful song.
=
Moonlight is really nice song. Maybe because their dress & mask, this stage remind me about Saint Seiya theme. But fullfil with beautiful performance. Love in Lovelyz's Dedication on stage & BTS. from a (G)I-DLE's fan.
=
This song sounds great and addicted.. its smooth and Lovelyz should have this kind of comeback
=
love this song.
=
istg i won't get tired watching this perf . coz its just so amazing
=
This is all about how to love yourself song
=
i hope they release a music video for this ckxbdjd i love this concept for them < 3
=
Stan vocals. Stan presence. Stan Lovelyz.
=
0:57 mijoo VOICE'S so pretty!  But her dorky side is hilarious!  I love it!  
=
This is Lovelyz best performance since I knew them in my sight
=
Why do everyone is so good in singing and dancing?
=
tbh i thought i wouldn't look up at lovelyz in queendom, it was the only group that I've never tried to stan in the "contestants"
but after watching their performances, i really fell in love with each one of the members, especiallly in the cameo performance.. guess i'm a lovelinus now!
=
WHY PEOPLE ARE DISLIKING THIS THIS IS AMAZING I LOVE THE BEAT I LOVE THE SONG I LOVE THE DANCE I LOVE THEIR VOICES THEY FIT THIS KIND OF CONCEPT VERY WELL IT'S NOTHING BUT GREAT
=
They got the best reaction when other groups hear through headphones. So its not surprising this song hits you so hard. Its actually much better than their usual title tracks.
=
Even though this song is different from other Lovelyz's song but still, can feel that Lovelyz's  vibe. Only Lovelyz can pull this concept.
=
2:34 I cannot be more amazed by Baby soul's powerful voice :0
=
This song is so good imo.
=
I genuinely didn't expect to like Moonlight. Lovelyz aren't usually my cup of tea, but this song was really good!
=
This is the first time I see lovelyz doing this kind of concept. I really liked it tho, hwaiting lovelyz!
0:58 btw she looks like Jane from momoland XD
=
My Favorite Final Song
1. Lovelyz’s Moonlight 
2. AOA’s Sorry 
3. Oh My Girl’s Guerilla
4. Others
=
Moonlight should get mv
=
Lovelyz make me gay af and I'm not even mad
On another note, I'm glad Woollim let the girls joined the show because I could see how much it's changed them as artists. Yein certainly has improved a ton vocally and Jin is more expressive. Jisoo too is doing amazing. In the past, they've only stuck to elegant concepts so smirking and looking tough and bad is definitely new to them. And when idols change their concept, it's always a hit or a miss with the general audience and fans. Either way I hope Woollim gives them a comeback similar to this stage. Now I just need another song like Destiny haha xD
Jin, Sujeong, Mijoo, and Yein seriously slayed this stage.
=
Honestly Lovelyz were doing so much this year and I’m happy for them to be doing so well. They had their group comeback, then they went on Queendom, and they actually did new concepts that were totally different from their usual style. Kei did her 1st solo album and it was amazing like a Disney song! And she still managed to do that while she’s still working in Queendom and preparing other performances in Immortal Songs! Jisoo honestly showed herself here! I’m sure Woolim will be giving her more parts in their songs after this, she also starred in a drama “One Fine Week” where she was the main actress and her acting was amazing!! She reminds me so much of Yoona, pretty visual, cute and talented! 
I honestly wish Lovelyz will get to take a holiday after this they worked so so hard!
=
Why do I notice that this show is really allowing the girls to finally show what their real vocals are?
=
this song besides Guerilla and Lion are my faves from the finale 
=
The best song ever.
=
Just who cried listen to this
=
Nice tribal outfit
Lovelyz : ive got only me
Lovelinus to lovelyz : we got only us
=
i stream this everyday
=
Woa ive watch all the songs for the final. And i think this is one of the best. At least for me it is. I like AOA amd Ohmygirl’s too
=
I'm so happy for lovelyz that wanted so bad to escape the cute concept, this is a great song ❤
=
This song makes me so emotional... I love them so much
=
Despite all the expectations that we have, Im a proud mama❤️
=
YES MAMMMM YES THIS SONG THEY BEED TO DO THIS STYLE MORE OFTEN
=
So happy Baby Soul got so many line in this song.
=
SUjeong high note give me goosebump
=
i love how babysoul hit that high note!
=
ahhh, seriously? lovelyz catch ma heart :(
=
Always come back here again and again
=
Vocally spectacular! so glad they let everyone show off in this song
=
We need Mv huhuuuu
=
Hermosas ❤❤❤
=
At the start of the show I started watching as a fan of Mamamoo and now the show has ended I've become a fan of Lovelyz along with the rest of the artist's on Queendom. I'm not a fan of their innocent concept but when they did their cover of BEG they caught my attention and I fell in love with their cover instantly even though they received a lot of hate for it. I'm totally loving this song and I hope their company lets them do more songs like this so I can become trash for Lovelyz as much as I am for Mamamoo. You girls may have not won the competition but you sure did win a new fan and I can't wait to see what you do in the future. #NewFaveSong #NewFan
=
i love this so muchhhhhhhhhhhh ❤️
=
Forget it i like all Queendom contestants final song..i just can't pick one.. always come back to every each of them.. honestly everyone is a winner
=
The best song of the final
=
Lovelyz will ALWAYS be number 1 in Lovelinus' hearts. We are so proud of everything that our Queens did ❤️ #AlwayzLovelyz
=
I thought mijoo is a visual
=
i see all korean comments... and i just happy korea recognize lovelyz so much, but in international they not get so many recognize just cause they use cute concepts...
=
Lovelyz you did good I hope you get rest and come back stronger
=
Sounds a bit similar to the Tequila song by G. ft ft Hoody.
I still liked the song and the group.
=
I dont know if it is just me or you guys also feels this way, but I feel that the lyrics of the songs is like their journey and stories throughout this queendom things...
=
Las amo desde México  ❤
=
I'm living for kei's hair
=
this should have been higher ranked imo. but of course groups that were already popular before this show means more votes for them. dont get me wrong, the other performances were awesome too, but this was really great and it ranked kind of low. hopefully now tho people realize what they've been missing out on. these girls can do any concept imo, and they are never afraid of doing something different from the usual. their vocals and flexibility with concepts make them the hidden gem of this show.
=
AMAZING PEOPLE, AMAZING STAGE, AMAZING VOCALS, AMAZING GIRLS, AMAZING LOVELYZ!
=
This kind of concept please woollim. I know their original concept is from Jaden, but please stray for once and give them this kind of concept. I need this kind of song with Lovelyz's voice.
=
HAPPY 5TH ANNIVERSARY
LOVELYZ, YOU'RE THE BEST
❤️❤️❤️
=
THEY REALLY SHOWED THEIR VOICES TODAYYY JUSTT LOOK AT URI JIAE , JISOO , MIJOO AND YEIN !! THEY GOT MANY LINESS ❤
=
I love Moonlight and Guerilla so much... I'm addicted T.T
=
This song is my type!
=
3:05  Babysoul powerful vocal
=
They have the best song!!
=
This is my 2nd favorite performance of the finals 
=
All the the 6 participants in Queedom are super excellent with their different performances. . I'm still very proud to support #LOVELYZ :-) though you're not the 1st rank, in My & other supporters/fans' heart you're indeed the #1goddessQueens . . . .
The 1st ever K-pop girl group idol I cheer, love, and stand with; and I have 2nd now the #RocketPunch #AlwaysSupportWOOLLIMartists #TrueEmotionTrueMusicTrueTalent . . . #INFINITE #GOLDENCHILD #JOO
=
Not really a fan but I watched them improved throughout the show and all I can say is they are amazing. ❣️ Keep it up girls! 
=
Wouah they really killed this concept
=
Such a mature concept. They look amazing.
=
This song help me fogert my ex and be free being me.
I cried with this song 
(Sorry for my bad English)
=
Guys don't worry too much about the views... Many fans of other groups (groups with way more international fans than lovelyz) only check their favourite group performance (or maybe they're simply not interested in lvlz... And that's okay!) so don't think about it! This performance still got almost 700.000 views in less than 3 days! Beautiful days (their last comeback) live performance on mcountdown still has to reach 300.000 views... And it was posted more than 5 months ago! Don't focus too much on other groups' numbers and keep supporting lovelyz like you always do!
=
They nailed it 
=
Well done lovelyz, I love you
=
Watched 
Mamamoo Destiny - seriously,this is it best song, move on
OhMyGirl Guerilla - ok ok wait what this is definitely best song, click
AOA - Western vibe ok hang on, this is dope best song ever, move to
Lovelyz - another Western vibe, god please help me this is best song, next!
Gidle - ok definitely this is the best song
Bom - ok you know what this is it
I CAN'T JUST PICK ONE.. I'm so freaking tired, always come back to watch every each of the performance..never missed one
=
Reinas ❤❤❤
=
I LOVE MY GIRLS Livelyz ftw :-(
=
They have really pretty voices
=
love this ❤️ truly lovelyz
=
Soo-Jeong looks like a Greek Goddess descended straight from the Mt.Olympus.
=
this is so good!!!
=
Lovely and soothing vocals as always from Lovelyz 
=
3:06 I love itttttt
=
Come here again today 
=
Jisoo, mijoo, jiae and yein looks better when they do this kinda concept. And kei, jin, babysoul and sujeong vocals soar better here. I feel like their vocals here are their original vocal tones than their usual title songs. In short can they stick to this concept from now on.
=
We need more views guys 
=
They should have a comeback in November before its too late to use their fame, their 6th sense cover was iconic by the way. They should rethink their concept, i love their concept but maybe they need a more poppy chorus?
=
I love the vibe of this song so much❤️
=
this stage is soooo beautiful :(
=
THIS SONG IS PRETTY AF
=
SIMPLEMENTE STANNEEN A LOVELYZ!
=
cant wait for lovelyz next comeback :o
=
That high notes from two Sujeong ❤
=
Happy 5th Anniversary Lovelyz!
You're the best girl group ever~
=
really love song lovelyz moonlight from all song quendoom
=
This is my fave song next to Sorry 
=
THIS IS AMAZING WHAT A MASTERPIECE
=
sin duda la mejor cancion de la final bella presentacion YEIN cada dia te amo mas
=
Beautiful ❤️
=
Underrated Talented Idols
=
Anyone else that is in love with Mijoo's voice? <3
=
the vocals are so good!!!
=
Not gonna lie, here just for Yein  
But this is a great song, quite different from the usual Lovelyz. 
=
Oh no, I realize that kpop girl comeback stage these days become so different  and absolutely amazed me.
=
Best queendom final song
=
Coming again today XDD
=
lit song . lit choreo . lit stage . lit oufits . everything about this perf is so lit . im only telling the truth
=
Of all the days that I'm watching this, idk but I feel emotional today.
=
Keep Going girls....Lovelinus are always with You 
=
I love Lovelyz.
I love this show.
=
I love this song so much!! Its just great!! ❤️❤️
=
Im so proud of Lovelyz
=
OMG i love this stage so much! I think this is the best stage they have in Queendom!
=
This song is made for sujeong’s voice. Her vocal timbre is so good it’s crazy!
=
Jisoo ❤❤❤❤❤
=
Well done Lovelyz ♥
=
Yein touch my heart 
=
LOVELYZ TUS PATRONAS 
=
Thank you for everything Lovelyz. For doing your best. You destrued the box that boxes ypu all this time showing you guys can show more sides of yourselves.
=
This is so good it needs more attention
=
Why are they so underrated? THIS IS THE REAL TALENT!
=
this preformance is so underrated..TBH lovelyz weren't so great during queendom.. but i think this preformance deserved to be much more popular than most of the other ones of the finals
=
All of them very beautiful and sound so clear.  Particular mention to Baby Soul, she was like possessed by the fineness and intensity of this stage, and Jin oh wow, I mean in this song and stage she truly shines, shines, shines too much.
=
1M De Vistas ♥️ Congratulations Lovelinus ♥️
=
I hope this song has a mv. Because the song is beautiful and i repeat again to hear it
=
Thank you for the reactions  (I loved Queendom)
(AOA made us Laugh), (Park Bom made us cry), (Lovelyz was Lovey), (Oh My Girl 'Concept' Queens or cry babies?), (Mamamoo being Mamamoo), & {(G)I-DLE can remix any song 1,000 times and still sound Awesome!}
=
só quero um comeback nesse conceito woollim
=
this is absolutely beautiful omg please stan lovelyz! and also happy 5th anniversarry to this amazing girls! ♡
=
I can’t help but cry...  watching my babies struggle was hard but most important watching them grow and develop as the amazing artists they are is such an awesome feeling LOVELYZ ❤️ LOVELINUS let’s go!
=
Please listen to their b-side track like sweet luv,  like u, doll, night and day,  temptation,  daydream,  secret garden,  just. The other side of lovelyz kinda similar vibe
=
Lovelyz fighting
=
ベイビーソウルちゃん可愛い…
歌声ハマる。
=
They got the best song. But everyone did some break dance or remix here and there. They just straight sang the song. How unfortunate
=
Well done！
I just smell the style transformation indeed. It's really hard to see this music and style tendency for lovelyz. The Moombahton music does work.
And the sound line of Babysoul is very suitable for this song.
=
Lovelyz reborn ❤️
=
Their dresses are stunning
=
i really like the choreo
=
i think i've fallen for soojung ><
=
Ryu Sujeong owns this songgggg
=
Sujeong's voice sounds like an angel, it is so perfect
=
All I know is I love this song
=
soul voice is so angelic
=
I'm not even a lovelinus, but wOOLLIM CAN YOU MAKE THIS KIND OF CONCEPT FOR THEIR NEXT COMEBACK????
=
this deserve more view ,u all better stream!
=
In my queendom they are my winners
=
This is legended...!!!
=
Woah.. rise lovelyz rise
=
I got only MEEE....keep repeating in my head Lol
=
Not my favorite stage, but the favorite song of the final, like the kind of song I would download and listen to in Spotify. tbh the stage is lack of storytelling, unlike the other groups. Anyway, this song deserves compliments.
=
I really like the song
=
Happy 5th anniversary Lovelyz!!! Lovelyz is the best!!!
=
i hope haters that are camping on lovelyz sixth sense video, will come to this video instead lol. time for yall to increase the views here
=
i need watch full episode 10. .but i can't watch on viu 
i need link
=
Jin rainha!!! Pra mim a melhor música da final!
=
I bet the instrumental will be amazing.
=
Jin 
=
Am i the only one want to repeat and repeat again this stage??? 
=
Waiting for mv
=
This seems very familiar 
=
Mi Joo is so beautiful uwu
=
Their performance is worth praising, even though they didn't win.
=
They really did different concept every stage. Girl crush - powerful - cute - sad elegant.
They deserve everything
=
what a song! I like it!
=
su tiempo de presentacion fue mas corto pero el tema fue hermoso cada show mostraron su calidad y c superavan yein mi diosa
=
My princess ♥
=
Selalu suka sama lagu2 yg dibawain lovelyz..
Begitupun ketika merek mengcover lagu lain.. Tp serius itu seperti lagu mereka sendiri..
Merka punya warna mereka sendiri..
Itu lah yg membuat mereka keren dan ditunggu2...
Tolong berikan banyak cinta kalian untuk lovelyz...
=
this is the best song but it's underrated, this comeback is a bop for lovelyz totally loved how they managed to continue the competition w their fans I STAN THEM SO BAD ❤
=
The pros of being a multistan: comeback from all your favourites
The cons of being a multistan: 
=
This is a winning performance! ❤
=
i love this perf so much
=
I've been telling since day one

BABYSOUL IS A POWERHOUSE VOCALIST
=
Ohhh yeah thats my gurls
=
2:06 its too late but someone plz tell me this girl's name? I have been in love with how elegant and cute her lips are when she sings (i know im weird) and her soft voice too. 
P/s:This is queendom, everyone is a queen so plz stop comparing and making fanwar. ☺
=
I can't stop replaying Soul and Sujeong's part "I've got only me" Do you know how long it's been since I found a song worth repeating? I only saw the most effort from 3 groups. Oh My Girl & (G)I-dle, then Lovelyz. Everyone else participated and seemed more casual in comparison. Park Bom could have done more creatively, AOA tried but seemed self-defeated and had concepts that needed two more members, and Mamamoo let their popularity and vocals carry them to #1 when really they should have been #4 or 5 with Bom.
=
did babysoul change her stage name to just soul or did the subtitles just shorten it lol
=
This song just proves that Bbsoul can do more. The chorus sound more powerful when she sings it. That 'I've got only me' highnote by 2Sujeong.
=
Mijoo is such a body goal
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Why there is so many dislikes its a damn good song
=
The performances is so good ☺but the outfit all of them too similiar。。。
=
hope they make MV like G idle
=
Woolim we need the mv!!!
=
Their vokals amazing 
=
My dope 
=
wow I can't say anything
=
give them line jisoo have 1 line and kei have 3 line
=
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
❤❤
=
Lovelyz Fighting
=
Not gonna lie but this song is one of my top 3 queendom final song
=
3:01
=
Lovelyz Fighting
=
wow just wow!!
=
Parabéns e melhor música da final..
   Eu adorei tudo nessa canção!!
=
I'm so glad for Queendom. I'm so glad I found this group to stan. I can't believe I hadn't known about them before. THIS IS A BOP.
=
this song is absolutely DIVINE and lovelyz definitely BROUGHT. THEIR. GAME. OUT. FOR. QUEENDOM. however... i REALLY wish they'd go for another shoe option.. actual ballet-practice flats are not... stylish... i'd personally recommend gladiator sandals (flats!) to go with the diana hunter look, or even ballet-flat-style shoes (not for actual ballet dancing, but for casual wear) would go really well with the look!

also BABYSOUL looks so amazing!!!
=
Sieettt!!!! Ang gandaaaaaaa ng final stage niyooo!!!!!!! You did well Lovelyzzzz!!!! Wahhhh!!! Grabe yung pag fafangirl ko!! Yes I'm a PH fann!!
=
Hey! Is this song a Lovelyz original? Or they’re doing a cover of someone else? I have the doubt since Sixth Sense was a cover. Thank you! Btw, they look gorgeous as always Greetings from Chile!
=
Keren bgt..
Opening yg terngiang2..
=
This is the best queendom song
=
When will woolim release moonlight MV? This song is too good without MV
=
I am really shock at Jiae's expression , so so so good, I can’t stop watching the video.
=
Love Lovelyz 
=
Love Lovelyz 
=
Love Lovelyz 
=
Lovelyz    perfect .
=
Melhor apresentação sem dúvidas
=
The best song
=
Cuantos fans Latinos de Lovelyz?

=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Lovelyz!!!!
=
Stan Lovelyz
=
2 SUJEONG'S VOICE OMGD
=
❤❤❤❤❤
=
this song is too underrated
=
Myungeunnie :-)
=
Woollim we need the dance practice or the mv please
=
Don't sleep on Lovelyz
=
Such a shame that woollim doesnt see them with this kinda concept. Its 2019 woollim make your move, people are getting bored by same old concept. I know people will target me after reading this but look at how they are going downhill after now we . Whatever they released after that didnt do that well and they can hardly get to top 50 on gaon singles chart.
=
Myungeun own this stage  Don't fight me.
=
Mijoo's long awaited dark sexy concept
=
2:50
=
Lovelyz Fighting
=
Soul's high note! Btw this song sounds a bit like reggaeton
=
If lovelyz go to MAMA people who usually votef for twice, and other overrated groups will realize they have been stanning wrong group all this time.
=
=
Lovelyz is one of these girl groups that actually are very versatile they can Pull every concept. I loved this show because maybe it started  tha all the groups probabily  could have each other but they broke thote kind of standard and they le us show how friendly  they are. Even lovelyz didnt win its still ok all the groups were great
=
Lovelyz so beautiful
=
Love Lovelyz 
=
 Lovelyz  
=
 Lovelyz  
=
 Lovelyz  
=
 Lovelyz  
=
DESTINY > DAYDREAM > MOONLIGHT
QUEEN OF THE MOON = LOVELYZ
=
❤️❤️
=
♥♥
=
They were the best surprise of the show for me, before queendom I didn't know much about Lovelyz but hell yeah they're definitely great artists and as I said before I'm now a fan
=
So Beautiful
=
Que lindo!
=
ซูจองสวยมาก จินผมสั้น(อีกแล้ว) ชอบเพลงนี้มากเลย ถึงไม่ใช่คอนเซ็ปน่ารักแต่เพลงนี้ดูเข้ากับLovelyzนะ
=
I mistaken thought someone's comment is bad reply, and I abuse him. I apologize him heartly very sorry 
=
good performance
=
Lovelyz Beautiful
=
=
All rounder group. As Park Bom said Lovelyz is brave for trying to challenged themselves with various concepts on queendom
=
So much better from what I expected. Lovelyz didn't win but all of us should recognize that they were the only group who took risk with good and bad result but they did,that was the purpose of the show and I'm so happy that everyone could see that side of Lovelyz that only lovelinus knows.
WELL DONE,GIRLS❤
=
In all Queendom stages, Lovelyz is really the one that gave us various stages. They really used the show to showcase different sides of them to the public that before only fans can see in their concerts. I'm super proud of them 
=
I think this is the among catchy songs that i do love
=
Love this kind of concept for the girls
Lovelinus here..a woollim enthusiast to be exact hehe
=
They are th true winners in this show for me <3333
=
I'm goosebumps❤️
=
AMAZING GIRLS! Y'ALL DID GREAT
=
I think Jin's performance is perfect this time.She has  magnetic voice and a keen sense of music，besides，her dance is very powerful！！Jin is not only the vocal on the stage, but also a performer who closely integrates songs and dances.I hope woollim sees her potential and gives her more opportunities because jin really deserves to be treasured.
=
Lovelyz so beautiful with this clothes and dance on the point like it so much 
=
tbh this is my fav song among all the contestants
=
As a moomoo, im actually really liking this song and performance so much... I dont even know how many time i repeated this song... It is so good... I like how they finally manage to get that dark/girl crush concept that they always wanted with the right song... I'm definitely gonna watch out for them in future...
=
Lovelyz: The Maenads
=
Sujeong and Mijoo literally made me breathless.
and Keis voice is giving me chills. One of the most beautiful voices and vocalists
The all look so pretty here!
=
I really love this song when I just listened  for first time 
=
Wow.. This is beautiful.. The dance move so beautiful. They song too and they too.. So pretty
=
Baby soul has such a stable voice I could listen to her all day  
Guess I have finally found a bias in Lovelyz
=
Ah i love Jin 
=
This performance is really overshadowed. Even me, I almost forgot it. But I think it's a great performance. ❤❤
=
Such a refreshing stage
=
This 3:04 part here really sound like a wailing and still got goosebumps even after so many replays....
=
This girls are so talented
=
Baby seoul and yein 
=
such a beautiful classy group of woman.. so talented.. who agreed
=
those people who dislike this  literally have no life at all.......get lost haters
=
I hated black achoo and sixth sense but I love this one
=
=
=
=
=
I love u Queenz
=
yein step on me please
=
Why the views not getting any higher ? It’s feel so wrong 
=
=
For my opinion ang galing nila super!!!!!
=
Such a masterpiece, the song is really catchy, the vibe is like Despacito, I really like it, they deserve better and I hope others could support them too.
=
This is my Lovelyz...
=
I'M CRYING RN..WE'RE SO PROUD LOVELYZ..YOU ALL DID YOUR BEST UNTIL THE END..
=
I swear the cameraman should just retire did they sleep during the rehearsals?? Its so unfortunate because the choreo is amazing.
=
I'm so happy that none of the teams got eliminated and got to be on the show all the way until the end.
=
ITS OVER WE FOUND OUR QUEEN 
=
Lovelyz , u did it very well too .. I hope that u'll use this kind of concept start from now on .. Bcos this concept really suit urs innocent side ..
=
Sujeong's eyes are talking. And her voice. 
=
love this concept
=
Now we just need to wait for lovelyz comeback
=
you did well, thank you so much for your hard work, we are proud of you, we are happy and proud to be your fans,
Lovelynus is always with Lovelyz
Lovelynus loves Lovelyz
lovelyz everything for lovelynus 
=
Best Performance  Jin voice everything
=
Park Myungeun need more this kinda songs... she really fiery here
=
1:20 I love her so much
=
The way Yein moves her body is so enchanting. She’s one of my favorite dancers throughout the whole show.
=
When our Lovelyz come to Midsomar Festival
=
btw, the producer of this song really come out many nice songs in kpop industry
=
I love Yein!!!
Vocal✅
Dance✅
Visual✅
=
Keii ❤
=
Day and Night blend with destiny 
This is logic
=
Great performance but maybe change the outfits a bit so they stand out from the back up dancers. A bit of rope isn't exactly eye catching
=
Is it just me? Sujeong's voice is so addictive.
=
i need a fancam ASAP!!!
=
What a strong highnote from babysoul and sujeong
=
Sujeong goddess over there
=
Wow the song is so nice the girls voice really suit the song too!
=
I GOT ONLY MEEEEEEEEEEEE
=
Jisoo, Mijoo, Soojeong, Yein ❤️
=
I think with all the quality performances given out by the groups on this show, they should all be performing at MAMA 2019.
=
I hope that their next comeback is this concept
=
The song so good
=
BABYSOUL COMING WITH THAT HIGH NOTE
=
WHO ARE WE KIDDING. 
ALL OF THEM ARE VOCAL LINE.
=
I wish they will release or anything for this
=
ITS SO GOOD I CAN'T BREATHE OH MY GOD MY GIRLS ARE SO PERFECT
=
Yassss Queens!!!
=
goosebumps
=
baby soul so beautiful
=
THEY REALLY SLAYED THIS CONCEPT OHMYYY
=
even though that lovelyz didn't win Queendom they already achieved what they want to try other genre and show it to everyone that they are not a one-dimensional idol group...

LOVELYZ FIGHTING!!!!
=
IS THAT THE POSING QUEEN I SEEE? I can spot her anywhere hehe
=
Like this performance...
=
 wow
=
this song is good .
=
Whatever are the results gonna be after this, I'm just gonna say, I'M PROUD OF YOU GIRLS. YOU GIRLS DID GREAT JOB. I'M REALLY PROUD OF LOVELYZ
=
=
Kei straight out looking like a goddess
=
Wish the outfits had the girls stand out more and not blend in with the backup dancers. General fans who are not familiar with the group would have a difficult time recognizing them without a closeup...
=
Çok seviyom çoookkkkk 
=
Damn every group have their unique concept... They are true singer and girl group
=
I can't take my eyes off Jin
=
if u wanna drag ur friends into kpop show them this
=
Eng sub where??
=
I dont care about Lovelyz winning or not. Just watch them perform is already enough
=
Please comeback with this song!!!
=
La verdad al principio del show no creía que Lovelyz fueran a impresionarme pero, creo que al igual que esta canción ellas se han encontrado a si mismas y al concepto que mejor pueden aprovechar, me siento bastante feliz por ver como grupos como Oh my girl y Lovelyz crecieron tanto, es maravilloso ver todo este desempeño, muchas felicidades Lovelyz espero que en el futuro pueda escuchar más música así de ellas.
=
The member with a short hair had me goosebumps when she start singing her lines
=
The girls who's name's Jin has a really beautiful voice!
=
This stage is really amazing! Love this song so much
=
I started to love Yein from queendom ❤️❤️❤️
=
Jin slayed this stage 
=
This is so GREAT!!! lovelyz unniedeul you've work hard. Let's keep on walking in flower road~~~
=
This song really gives justice to the voices of Lovelyz! 
=
tbh i love this song the most out of all the songs, although i'm an omg fan, my music tastes say this one is best for me
=
destiny>daydream>moonlight, i think we need another trilogy again with this kind of concept for Lovelyz...
=
Voice 
Expression
Visual
Dance
Perfect. Even they did not win they are still my QUEEN. only LOVELYZ.
=
I appreciate them alot because of queendom! Thanks Queendom for making the Girl Groups to grow ! Fighting Lovelyz
=
L O V E L Y Z !!! fall in love with  Your voice guys ..
=
I'm so proud of Lovelyz. Thanks for showing us all these wonderful sides to you ❤
=
Ahhhh weee Lovelyz se veían bien Diosas ahh mis niñas ♥️ Lovelinus Stream Moonlight ♥️ vamos por 1M de vistas ♥️
=
I'm so happy this show ended and Lovelyz creates a new image for them! This is it! I love these girls so much and I would support them til the end. Btw Sujeong's ash hair thooo
=
Lovelyz Will always be Lovelinus's Quuen
=
Love this stage!! So different from previous Lovelyz songs but still had the Lovelyz taste! Soul is so beautiful too! 
Can't wait to see how Lovelyz will continue to grow after this. Lovelyz fighting!!!
=
never understood why lovelyz has so many haters. they deserve so much love and way more appreciation.
=
i got goosebumps❤️
=
I DONT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO EXPRESS HOW PROUD I AM with LOVELYZ,,,,,zzzzzzzzzzz why so many people sleep on them
I predict them to be top three with this masterpiece song
But even they got 5th,i hope people will recognize them later after queendom
=
Their vocal so good
=
the music is so good and their voices are extremely beautiful
=
LOVELYZ 
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR HAPPY ENDING
=
I think this is  the fairest stage they ever had. All  of  the member shine and no one outshine each other. I must agree they  suited this  concept. I noticed that Kei never once smile during  the entire performance. She was so into the character. I must  praise their underrated main vocalist, JIN she show a lot improvement to me. She suited the song and boomm  her expression.. I'm speechless. For Jiae, I want to praise her effort in dancing bcs she doesn't look kind of stiff anymore. The rest of the member?No words can explain   it   I've been  their fan since  CJL and this is their best stage ever. I can  see that  Woolim  finally  releasing the beast in them. Just like Bom said, they pay soo much for this song & I hope woolim will  still doing that for their next comeback. Last but not least, no matter what the result is we as LOVELINUS  must  accept it  with open  heart. Don't  give up & please  don't leave the fandom. Let's  us stick  together ❤ spread love and not hate
=
Vocal queens. Real life goddesses! These girls put on stunning, perfect performances!
=
Yein is seriously so freaking PRETTY
=
Everytime I see sujeong, I was like, oh she is Jinhyuk's wife. I hope both fandom don't get angry because I couldn't stop thinking about it.HAHAHA.  The performance is super good.
=
Really need a mv from this
=
I really like songs like this.
Hope Lovelyz will comeback with songs like this 
=
Please comeback with this kind of concept..
=
Jin is so hot!!!
=
I Love Jisoo!!!
=
This is my album’s fav song
=
THIS IS SOOOVKDHDJJS GOOOOOOODDDDDDD OMGG WOWWOWWW W WOWOWOWOWOW
=
Their long hair, their face, their clothes. They really fit goddess concept. Lovelyz fit goddess concept. Periodt. Not fairy concept. Let me repeat. Goddess!!
=
Can they like perform this on music shows? This was a great song. I'm also talking about the other songs from the other girls, whoever made these songs are giving fresh images to these GGs. ❤️
=
URI LOVELYZ  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
2 SUJEONGS HIGH NOTE THO???????
=
Fancam and full stage cam please!!!
=
THIS SONG AAAAA
=
Lovelinus proud of lovelyz
=
okay i just knew lovelyz thru queendom and i'm really surprised by babysoul's vocals. wow
=
I came into Queendom as a Moo and came out as all 6 group fans.  I got to say though with this performance I was speechless with how much Lovelyz has grown.  This concept is just beautiful.  I'm definitely gonna keep a close eye on this group.
=
Imagine being told you’re only good at one thing all the time, I think this is a great performance and song for them, they wanted to show diversity and I think they achieved it, Lovelyz fighting!
=
I'm not a fan of any cutesy concept so this kind of song is really good, the song and i came to love yein since tge dance unit six puzzle was formed. 
=
LIVELYZ
=
GODDESS

=

=

=
Being a selenophile is so hard Coz I'm obsessed to the moon backround
=
This song really suits them specially their vocal line..
=
❤️
=
=
1M ?
=
=
Lovelyz 
=
Their performance is too short compared to others. Hmmm
=
ART.
=
Why so late to watch this epic performance
=
=
=
=
=
=
I Love You
=
Really need an mv and a dance practice

Woollim hear my plea
=
This song is like Rumor in produce 48 ♥, I love this song, it's addictive ♥
=
Thanks to queedom, we Lovelinus are fed well with bunch of new concept from Lovelyz  Real Lovelinus will just appreciate everything they gave us instead of complaining  #L8velyz
=
3:05 who's her omg she's GORGEOUS i can'T
=
I died at yein’s be my own
=
Amazingly good. Woollim's " True Emotion, True Music, True Talent"
=
From the 1st ep to this one they truly improved a lot! I can see some of them got a little bit more confident &Also, I am glad they tried this kind of concept since it really suits them! Not cute not sexy but unique!
=
THEY KILLED THIS STAGE
=
This camera work suckkkkeeeedddd!! but LOVELYZ vocals were AWESOME! my girl BABY SOUL killed it!!!
=
I love the song! It reminds me to the last Laboum song -“fireworks”
=
I have come to love all the colors they showed in queendom... I really want to see more of such performance from lovelyz..
=
finally YOO JIAE!
=
lovelyz sound is so unique even if the concept is dark it’s still so lovelyz  lovelyzpop>>>>>>
=
Babysoul have a strong and incredible voice, i love it so much
=
ITS OVER, I LOVE MYSELF.

Yes, ladies! Yes! LOVE YOURSELF AS MUCH WE LOVE U!!!
=
I am so proud of Lovelyz. I wasnt the biggest fan of Sixth Sense, just because that song is so intense. But this song is such a Lovelyz color but Darker. I love the sweet/charming Lovelyz song, but I also adore this.
=
Lovelyz is one of my favorite group, girls all did very well,  I am really happy that they show up in this program, and bring us a lot of brilliant stages.
which lead us to find out their true capabilities. 
Lovelyz, the best U are. Fighting and will stand by U as always.
=
Babysoul is the oldest but she’s the cutest ❤️
=
I am beyond pround and happy!!!! ❤
=
it's 7AM here so it's time to watch this masterpiece again yeah good morning
=
so proud of my girls!!
=
So underrated
=
Performance WONDERFUL!! Lovelyz ❤❤
=
WOW LOVELYZ ‍♂️‍♂️‍♂️
=
I love Lovelyz and i love their song. You are the best of my mind
=
3:10 - 3:13 and 3:35 - 3:39
My fav choreography 
=
Lovelyz so good i love ittttttttt lovelyz fighting
=
Jiae unnie , you make me happy...❤️❤️
=
Sexy concept, great song ❤
=
Oooh these outfits are giving me nightmare flashbacks of a bridesmaid’s dress I had to wear *shudders*
=
Mis reinas, ame la canción y la presentación en vivo como siempre perfecto ❤️.
=
Lovelyz Goddesses of the moon
=
#lovelyz always a winner in my heart no matter what..
=
I really hope Mnet continues with this sow and produces more shows like this
=
Could someone please possibly link me to a good video to introduce me to the fandom of this group? I really want to stan them 
=
Those dislikers, i know u are secretly jamming to this song HAHAHA 
=
is it just me hearing the second chorus part sung by Sujeong is a lil bit faster than the first one?
=
AOA stan here! i liked their performance here and love their song
=
I love moonlight stage but were camera men sleepy coz they failed to do their job for this stage
=
Great job... Kei is so beautiful here
=
Ooooh did not expect the spoopy masks. This was a very cool performance. Flawless!
=
第一次看完的反應覺得編舞上沒有爆點，有點失望，但梨子的風格本來就是這樣，看多次一點就中毒了
=
If only Yein was not robbed at the performance category :(
=
咦～？封面圖怎麼改了
原本封面是洙正的說
=
Fck the dead audience Lovelyz got little praise throughout the show compared to others I’m so upset :(
=
Latin style
=
u guys so preettyyy thooooo
=
Gente que gracinha, eu amei elas no Queendom vou sentir saudades de ver a Key
=
La canción es super hermosa, pero el concepto le faltó algo, esperaba algo más
=
=
Mijoo should of gotten a dance break to herself
=
I'm so Proud as a Woollim stan because all of the woollim trainees|idols that participate in Mnets Survival show did a very very good performance. I'm proud
=
They are awesome
=
is sujeong one of the main vocalist? im confuse  i see passion in their performance ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Not really a follower of this group, but I believe they held their own in this Queendom Project. Very nice final stage. I've really enjoyed this project by Mnet.
=
Lovelyz  baby Seoul 
=
YO THIS IS THE BEST SONG, THE BEST STAGE EVER DJDNDEND I CAN'T BREATHE
=
1M goooo
=
PERFEITAS????
=
I loooove
=
LiveLyz as Always 
=
I wish I had Jin/Sujeong/Kei's voice their voice are so unique and beautiful
=
I want them to perform this song at Mama 2019.
This is one of their best songs everyone must see this 
=
The most important thing is what they learned all this time in Queendom. They have obviously improved a lot but, beyond that, it feels like they're enjyoing the whole performance, song, choreography, etc. A plus to Lovelyz for take a risk to change their original concept!
It's sad some people are sleeping on them because they're such a beautiful group. Hopefully they gain more fans after Queendom and break it with a big hit.
All the contestans of the show are truly Queens <3
=
So much dislikes compared to others. I'm really tired of this. Haters' obsession to Lovelyz is to much. What do you want? Explain me do you just dislike for not liking song/performance ?
=
STAN LOVELYZ!!!! ❤️❤️
=
Imagine if they made a comeback similar to this.
=
AHHH this is so freaking good!!!! I’m so proud of you Lovelyz, eventhough you didn’t win, people finally notice these girls’ talent!!! please give them the recognition they deserve for their future comebacks ❤️
=
Lovelyz you've done great❤️! I love Soul&Mijoo's voice color too so for them to get this many lines is touching 
=
honestly idk that they have a lot of powerful vocalist until they covered BEG song and proof it with this song
=
this makes me so happy, not only their vocals shined in this song and they look beautiful (baby soul is SO pretty !!), but i feel like they learned a lot from their previous stages. with each one they really learned a lot from themselves and their sound to the point they got to have their own song with a different concept and sound from their usual title tracks, still managing to keep the lovelyz sound and elegance in it. look at their past title tracks: they went from sweet, innocent love songs about their first love to having their relationship end; moonlight is nothing more than the end of a cycle and the start of a new one. i really hope woollim will let them keep this sound, or at least the kind of lyrics this song has, cause they've grown up a lot and their music deserves to evolve too.

prizes aside, you have won so much from this show, lovelyz. <3
=
Such a perfect performance! ❤
=
YOU GUYS DESERVED BETTER U GIRLS DID SO WELL I'M SO PROUD OF ALL, YOU'RE AMAZING, NEVER FORGET, DON'T SLEEP ON LOVELYZ'S TALENT PLEASE, DON'T FORGET THEM
=
This is like my fourth time watching this just this hour...
=
Super powerful stage!!! ❤️
=
IMHO this was the most ambitious performance of the night. It’s almost like when girls day went to something... making a mark that they are going to grow from their cutesy concept... still absolutely lovely but with a tinge of maturity... the future will be really really fun for them.
=
Amazing they're voice is so awesome
=
no one recognized jiae’s voice at first because everyone’s used to her cute voice
=
Lovelyz stans should be proud ❤️
=
IM SO PROUD
=
The message here is really impressive and important, I think Lovelyz should focuse in their own path, getting stronger, loving theymselves, knowing who they are and fighting for it. There's no need to do anything else :") 
Ps. The song is really enjoyable and I love how other members shined here 
=
Yes!! Lovelyz is back. I had been waited for this version and you can do it!!!!! Unlock lovelyz
=
hmm hmm hmm okay firstly when i first heard this song, i'm addicted! and i cant stop replaying this song and play it in 1 hour loop. secondy, actually when i know that they are gonna compete in this program, i kinda don't like it but eventually thru this show i know that they r trying to break free from what they usually do. and that's a bonus bcoz for me they really worked hard to go out from their comfort zone, and there are people who just realize their capabilities thru this show.

for Lovelyz, u girls have worked hard and we lovelinus are really proud of u girlss! despite your busy schedules you still worked hard to give your all in this show. its okay you didn't win in this competition but you guys have win all our hearts. Good job, Lovelyz! We all will love u till the end and we are so proud of u! Lovelyz fighting! Stay pretty and healthy always! Love u 3000 <3 <3 <3
=
Love this so much!!!
=
This stage is exactly what I I have imagined Lovelyz would perform : stage, outfits and vocals...everything is just perfect !
=
I can tell the best performance is
Omg then loveliz
=
Im proud of these girls. From debut till today, they did amazing. 
=
THANKYOU LIVELYZ 
I lOVE YOU GIRLS SO MUCH 
LOVELYZ JJANGG
=
Jisoo and Jiae, FINALLY!!! Sujeong baby you're fantastic 
=
Uri lovelyz neomu caresssssooooooo!<3
=
I did know from the very beginning they wouldn't win this contest even if I had my hopes up, because Korea is sleeping on them. But my lovelinus heart is so, extremely proud of them. They proved they can slay any concept and they're all great vocalists and dancers. 
They are the winners for me, they are on top 
=
Keep streaming guys!
=
I can feel the inspiration from Midsommar in this performance!!
=
Kei❤️
=
Woollim, can we have moonlight dance practice Halloween theme 
=
Babysoul line it's the best part of the song for me  her voice is just beautiful and pleasant
=
Their voices are really powerful and catchy I'm surprised 
=
Can you hear that? It’s all their beautiful voices!! This song makes them justice!!
=
Im so impressed
=
This song is a bop  lovelyz did so well 
=
camera work sgt la krik krik, part best banyak giler dlm performance ni tp cameraman tibai zoom out n masukkan kepala audiences, than angle pun sgt la hurmmm 
=
Netizens and those trolls who been camping to hate on Lovelyz since day 1 are secretly jamming to this right now. So proud of my babies and hopefully Woolim will finally give them a proper comeback/PR now that the show is over.
=
THEY ARE THE BEST.
=
Yein Mijoo
=
Its over i found myself...
=
Thank you lovelyz 
=
The song is really good and the costume is good too.. I just wished that the female back up dancers' outfits are noticeably different..like not so much similar with the members so the members would shine more.. That would make this stage better..
=
I love this stage. The song. The girls all!
=
Feel like this song is sister of G.Soul - Tequila .-.
=
Lovelyz Fighting
=
Wonderful!!
=
Baby Soul  ❤ ❤ ❤
=
Lovelyz so beautiful
=
加油！
=
I think it was good they got 5th position, because if they rank higher maybe they'll get tons of hate. Because people always hate lovelyz even if they're doing good and my heart can't handle it.
Anyway, finally this show ended.. very good job lovelyz, you guys really work hard for this show!!
From now on, let's walk on flowery path 
=
To the people who keep on saying such things,
First, this is Lovelyz style since Destiny era. If you will look closely, this feels like the dark version of Destiny and Night and Day.
Second, don't bring up any groups on the comment section that can start any fanwars. Lovelinus are very much happy to report you to Woollim so you all can pay a million won.
Third, DO NOT DISRESPECT LOVELYZ IN THEIR OWN VID. Simple as that
Fourth, Lovelinus is happy even if Lovelyz didn't won because we saw what Lovelyz is capable of doing. We were so glad to witness Lovelyz having an experimation with different concepts, so it's a win win for us. 
LASTLY, STAN LOVELYZ COWARDS 
#Lovelyz_Moonlight

Queeen

=
=
please Stop Eating CD girl
=
I love u
=
Wow
=
Lovelyz is one of the humble Kpop Girl Group they need to receive recognition not hate. My Queens, don't worry the queendom is already finish so  bashing from the other fandom to all of you will lessen(I'm not saying it will stop but atleast it will lessen somehow)
=
I think its time they did a song with strong orchestra music with a classy dance number.....babysoul her voice is amazing....well done girls
=
This songs really hit me hard and its kinda related with my stress today TT when baby soul and sujeong sang 'i got only me' i cried i LITERALLY CRIED.
=
This song utilized all of the girls vocals so well. I’ve been wanting a powerful vocal song from Lovelyz for so long as a title I’m so proud!! 
=
OH MY GAAAAD KEI <3 I love her style <3 <3 she looks like a goddess from 
Greek mythology <3
of course also the other girls!!! <3
I could never tell from Yein, Sujeon, Mijoo and Kei - who would be my BIAS. They are soooooo amazing, clever and beautiful <3
=
This stage is  RIP REPLAY BUTTON.  #LOVELYZSARANGHAE #WinnerInLovelinusHeart
P.S Jiae is so beautiful.  
=
Feels like new not to hear Kei voice in chorus but I think I finally found what concept suits Jin well,, ,, Lovelyz,, you are the winner to me !!!
=
sujeong and mijoo's “be my baby” omg im shaking..... im like, sURE I'LL BE YOUR BABY
=
They deserve the hype! 
=
It’s over, my girl! Lets walk in a flower road and have a happy ending!!!
=
The continue story after Destiny and Daydream
Love it!!!!!
=
Sujeong's voice and visual, ooh la la~
=

Soul's voice is soothing and sounds sexy effortlessly 
=
Their voices are really awesome
=

=
This was a bop
I loved it 
 ~Neverland
=
Queen of moon is back  finally I here jiae voice not cute one but a true voice of her.   Why I love Lovelyz even they don't have many award still they are the best for everything. Woollim stan 
=
I love camera's work for kei's part 1:56 2:46
=
I think this is their best song! Really shows their vocal, i didnt know before JIN really that good!
=
My girls!!!! Babysoul!!! I hate this camerawork but my girls did so well!!!!!

=
Lovelyz is the best!!!!
=
So sadddd. I want to see Jin with long hair. But Good song and Good Stage.
Lovelyz Fighting.
=
Myungeun really slay this song, seriously her voice. ALSO 2 SUJEONG DAAMMNNN.
=
I need a Jin fancam like now o_o
=
幹看不下去了，是有沒有那麼喜歡一直拉遠景啊，別組都沒有就lovelyz一直拉，人都看不清楚了是都在混的嗎
=
I'm never expected BabySoul's voice would be THIS GREAT
=
A group under a company who cares about talent. They carried the "true music true emotion" well. Good job queens ❤️
=
I love you Lovelyz
=
I love the song and I love the dance but the stylist has a  grudge against the members or something???? I especially didn't like baby souls dress like it did nothing for her! I'm just hating that dress!I get shes a bit chubby which is cute but why not style her body to make it look better and not worse? This has been happening for years like common woolim!!!
=
I actually liked it. It was good.
=
I like their song the most
=
same lovelyz but more mature
=
Gooo to 1m
=
I'm very surprise when I saw the number of dislike. Queendom made it happen lol
=
Powerhouse
=
Omg
=
Feels a lil bit weird cuz I can't tell if they're lipsyncing or not. But deeeeym I loved this song the moment I heard it
Best wishes for this group!
=
Lovelyz biggest weakness was their company. Cheap looking stages and a minimum level of investment into their costuming.
=
daebakkkk
=
Gila gila keren banget
=
Who won entirely?
=
Lovelyz
=
QUEENLYZ
=
lovelyz the best
=
2:07 who is she?
=
Lovelyz
=
I like this song. It's really goods song. And Jiae's voice is different now too. ,
=
This is so mythical and lunar elves' movement. If add instrumental quarts harf and guitar, in the middle of. will be more romantic. Lovelyz is lit!
=
I CAN’T EVEN UNDERSTAND THOSE DISLIKE
=
487 haters press dislike button...
No matter HOW good LOVELYZ are, haters always gonna hate!
=
"It's over,  I found myself"
=
Anyone realize that they change Babysoul's stage name into only "SOUL"??
=
LOVELYZ didn't need a costly production just to slay their performance... You really did well~
=
You did great girls! Congratulations!
=
WOOLLIM PLEASE RELEASE A MV OF THIS SONG WITH THIS CONCEPT ! (;A;)
=
although their views is below 100k and lagging behind other contestants, whatever they will win or not, but I think Lovelyz is a legend and they slay it. dont argue with me. :)
=
Thank you for all of the stages in this show girls. You did amazing and hard work. Proud fan is here ❤
=
Lovelyz need concept like this for next comeback ....  woollim please open your eyes... 
I love it ... this is the mature of lovelyz... pretty and sexy but still lovely... 
=
It's reallyy daebaakkkk
=
This is the Lovelyz I expected them to be when they first debuted coming from Woolim. THIS IS IT CHIEF. THIS. IS. IT. A+++
=
Please comeback with concept like this
=
The vocals so LIT!!!
=
This is the Lovelyz I expected them to be when they first debuted coming from Woolim. THIS IS IT CHIEF. THIS. IS. IT. A+++
=
Sounds wonderful  
Is it only me feeling INUYASHA vibe ? 
=
You did well♡
=
I love this song so much. Good job girls!

Keep slaying Queenz
=
Lovelyz mis niñas gracias por este performance y esta canción hermosa .
=
=
So amazing
=
Myungeunaaaaaaaa 
=
Its so power full...
=
I love seeing lovelyz growth in queendom and the fact that they able to make friends here is awesome too 
=
Ok, to me they won, they show us  various styles and I think that Lovelyz is the only group who took risks. I'm proud of them!
=
Wow. Just wow.
This song doesn't look awkward at all. 
It seems like this is their own.
=
jisoo amd yein really lookalike todayyy ❤
=
Вау. Это просто волшебно
=
lo hicieron perfecto
=
I really need the mr removed of this to prove everyone was wrong about they lip syncing,, our Lovelyz did really well in singing live and obviously they’re singing live if you know Lovelyz they always slay singing live on stage they are always the best I don’t get it why people keep posting wrong things about them. Lovelyz is lovely girls ever and stop hate them
=
Ese Assa Hwan anda en todas
=
Me gustó mucho esta canción.....espero un comeback con el mismo estilo
=
I love when lovelyz keep challenge themselves with new genre..they take this opportunity to show new side of them that woolim doesnt let they do when they make comeback..they just can show their strenghness (elegant cute ) but just to show new side to their lovelinus...no matter what i hope lovelyz can have a better future and gained many fans especially international fans..
=
all the dislikers hmm i bet 85%  of them are secretly jamming to this haha
=
Wow
=
am i the only one think that sujeong is the center?
=
las amo
=
Only elite people know how to apreciate this art, and the dislikes are from not smart peoples who's trying to figure out about this art but their brain just can't take it. It's okay not everyone has  good taste . THANK YOU LOVELYZ for always give us the best performance
=
Is this song theirs or is it a cover? If it is a cover, who's artist is it??
=
Hello
=
Tengo que admitor que este programa de Mnet realmente hizo que todas las participantes se lucieran en cada episodio. Y ayudó a que todos los grupos obtuvieran más reconocimiento y atención, así que de alguna manera TODAS GANARON.
=
can someone tell me what their final rank ?
=
Can I know the ranking for all group?
=
They tried everything they wanted ➡they satisfied with what they have done➡me as lovelinus satisfied 
I just proud and happy because they can have this opportunity and they grabbed it and show everything they want to do to not only lovelinus but also to the public. Maybe they want to prove, maybe not, but I know they are brave and strong enough to leave their comfort zone. I love you my girl. LOVELYZ ALWAYS QUEENS IN MY HEART 
=
Legal :v
=
i love song
=
Wollim give them good songs like this....girls are all ready....hell they were born ready
=
Just saw this on twitter
Girl crush Ah-Choo
Powerful Sixth Sense
Musical Cameo
And now
Elegant Artemis Goddess Moonlight 
And not to say Yein and Kei performance too have different style..
LOVELYZ VERSATILE QUEEN 
=
They did great. The song, their expressions, the dance, and the outfit matched well. It would be great if they add dance break but no problem. Good job lovelyz!
=
THE REAL 2019 SOTY IS HERE WHAT ARE Y'ALL DOING
=
Omg again they have least view but the most disikes? Omg what’s wrong with these haters
=
Not a big fan of Lovelyz but as I saw their growth and performance in Queendom, they proved it's worth to stan them. Great job Lovelyz fightinggg always!
=
They are the best girl group in my heart
=
1:18 is so satisfying to watch over and over again  
The girl formation, the backdrop change, the music, ALL
=
OMG IM SHOOKT I LOVE THIS PERFORMANCE 
=
How i wish they start the song with acapella. It would be amazing too. Overall, i love them so much!
=

=
They find themselves.. They are GODDESS...
=
QUEEN JISOOOOOO
=
Lovely Queenz
=
Oh shoot they snapped 
=
Wig snatched
=
Sujeong really caught my eye since I watched Queendom. Her beauty is really attractive as well as her voice.
=
When kei performed with hwasa, I then started to stan her 
=
SUPER PROUD
=
in love with sujeong's new hair 
=
"True Music, True Emotion" Woolliment. Great performance by Lovelyz Elegantlyz amazinglyz.
=

=
Me gusto este tema muy diferente de lo que habia escuvjado de ellas
=
Jisoo
=
is this live or it's pre recorded??
=
Pllz go to 1m
=
Just go away if you don't like this performance. Please don't hurt your finger just to chat hurtful.
Lovelyz, our girls, really hard working to show this awesome performance. They don't deserves your hateful.
=
So good
=
The song much better than oh my girl.  But oh my girl can make their song more powerfull.
=
I just don't understand why ppl are hating them so much, I mean like why??   those who don't even know them just criticize them in Sixth Sense and saying nonsense. Literally for anything they did, they received hatred 
For those who hate them bcs of their 'cutesy' concept pls wake up, that's not a crime at all,just leave and stop downgrading them!
=
They are so underrated.. people should try to at least watch this performance.  this is so good
=
Lovelyz have won my heart. They have pushed themselves and grown so much in Queendom. Due to the concept forced upon them, they wanted to show other sides to the public (although Lovelinus have seen it in their concert). And I think they were definitely successful! I love you Lovelyz!!
=
Why so short?  I want more~ 
Buddy come for Lovelyz.
=
i like all their performance in queendoms but this.. I fell inlove even more. I hope they win, i mean they all deserve to win but, i'm a lovelinus u know. so i hope my group win. but i don't care i love them.
=
i don’t know why .. but when i listen to this song , suddenly i cry  i can feel emotion from this song ❤️ thank you for this song lovelyz  you all are QUEEN OF MOON 
=
Fans are happy no matter what the Lovelyz performs, so don't be intimidated. I hope you do whatever you want to do.
=
Baby Soul has a different type of beauty, I love it
=
Tbh, this concept is what I expect when they release their last album.... now, queendom is over. Can we get some real cb in few months?? 
=
LEMME CRY :') IM SO PROUD OF THEM :")
=
They feed lovelinus so well! <3
=
Stan Lovelyz the Best o love youu♥️
