Become a moomoo after listening to decalcomanie
=
Why does Mamamoo always make it like it's their concert??? 
=
"i don't even care about the competition, i love them."
"stop being so gorgeous"
"i don't think i can sit beside them"

i feel you girls
=
Unpopular opinion: MAMAMOO are not just idols anymore, they are ARTISTS
=
"I don't even care about the competition. I love them!"
Damn that is a great attitude! Hahahahaha your tactics are not working, MNET. This won't be another Produce hhahahaha
=
Girly who said, "I don't even care about the competition. I love them."  The highest level of Moomoo jumped out 
=
The moment Mamamoo enters , everyone is their fan .
=
Mamamoo can simply breathe and everyone will question their sexuality
=
Wtf? This is the best vocalist girl group i've ever heard recently
=
It doesn't matter whether you are a mamamoo fan or not, all of the girls are main vocalist and they're one of the best vocalists in K-pop and that's just facts
=
Who else feels like they’re in Mamamoo concert? ‍♂️ 
Just me? Okay
=
Hwasa's stsge presence is unreal. She was born to be on stage.
=
Mamamoo really make all the girls fall in love with them
=
I still don't understand why they join this competition They're so incomparable!
=
Hopefully there's no evil editing. Looks like everyone is having fun
=
Lee Da-hee is just enjoying like a true MOOMOO every time that the girls show up....LOVE HER!
=
Coming back to this after Hip era.
Gosh. Who would imagine they were gonna rock 2019 in so many diff ways.
This was only 4 months old. And mmm show so many diff side of them.
=
This group deserves  a coachella moment. Like how can someone ignore this talent.
=
Mamamoo really don't need to do much to get everyone to fall for them ugh mamamoo fever!!!
=
I think this show isn’t a competition, I think it is a concert of combining 6 group for all the fans 
=
In my humble opinion - Queendom should have insisted that all groups will sing LIVE. Just to be fair for overall quality of GG. Well anyways - Mamamoo really knows how to perform impressively. Their overall quality is above and beyond some famous/ well known GG in present industry.
=
Hwasa starting that out while squatting was so fcking iconic. She is a Queen.
=
There is no recycled Mamamoo performance and honestly Mamamoo's performances are so fun!
=
"I don't even care about the competition. I love them!"
=
No matter what, MAMAMOO ALWAYS knows how to put on a performance
=
3:23 *Kei seeing Hwasa shine* "wow I want that one" lol
=
"I don't care about the competition! I love them" - - yooA
=
some comments about how amazing mamamoo's vocals here have never seen their immortal song performances and it shows :)
=
Why couldn’t have CLC Be also added to this show, like damn
=
*how to turn a show into your personal concert*
=
One of their best live honestly. Voices are so stable dance is on point charisma is at the top. There's nothing to do but stand them 
=
they always know how to entertain the audience, I stan so hard.
=
MOONBYUL SNAPPED HER RAP RAPTS GIRL STEP ON ME PLEASE
=
I really hate saying this. But mamamoo is way way way cooler than your oppars
=
sometimes i think that MMM is the lost girl group from 2nd gen  their vibe is just not 3rd gen mayn!! they look so matured. like seniors
=
Their performances make it seem like they're in a concert damn.... The audience was captivated by them every performance it just felt so much like a concert
=
Too much cuts. Mnet evil editing rises again
Mamamoo rise up!
=
queendom is basically a bunch of girls fangirling over mamamoo and park bom
=
Can we talk about how there are so many cute guys in the audience?


also MAMAMOO ARE QUEENS
=
This would have a lot more views if the title wasn't all Hangul.
=
god, I have other girl group bias but MAMAMOO will always be the queen of performance...QUEENS!!!!!!!!
=
How is it like to be a general?
Mamamoo: I feel good!
=
Mamamoo are the best live performers in the industry. Nuff said.  
=
They gave 150% into this, sooo powerful, the roof is probably on fire
=
They are real singers ,you can be a famous idol and can't sing at all.Very talented group.
=
The fact that BNM trainees get more screen times in here than produce x 101 lol
=
I could watch Moonbyul's wrap a million more times. The first one always gives me chills
=
"I don't even care about the competition, I love them" SO CUTE, OMG YOOA!!
=
Im cryingg
I'm so proud of them 
Be Moomoo it's one of the best decision i've made  and never be afraid of it.
=
Can we talk about Wheein and Hwasa at the background constantly giving us falsettos and whistles all throughout? Coz that was STUNNING.
=
I swear if i keep on watching anymore i might not be straight after this video. 
=
Listening to Mamamoo I “I feel good” 
=
Guys. Please i cant be straight when i heard Moonbyul Second Rap goddamn it so cool :"))))
=
Just wanna say they were the first girl group from a non big 3 company to win a daesang
=
Did anyone else notice that the flags have the members' official symbols on them? 
DAMN what a performance. They always perform like they're at a concert, it's insane
=
They're real singers omggg and their performance skill is super goodddd
=
decalcomanie is THAT song! it's timeless and showcases their powerful vocals and rap. hwasa's charisma and hyping the crowd, solar's powerful vocals, wheein's runs over moonbyul's rap is pure fire!
=
MAMAMOO don't take stage they own the stage. Always. Their stage presence is so natural, so charming
=
2:36 "I don't even care about the competition, I love them !
*THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT*
=
THIS IS LITERALLY A CONCERT BISHHHH!!
=
And you know what makes it better?! THEY AREN'T LIPSYNCING!
=
why the hell is there so many cute boys, gezzz.
=
Winning or not: MAMAMOO WILL ALWAYS BE QUEENS AND LEGENDS IN KPOP❤
=
2:09 that's exactly my expression watching this performance
=
When I listen to the song on Spotify I expect to hear them talking and screaming, the song is so much more fun this way
=
mamamoo: let me teach these kids how to spell queen

lmao 1.1k liked
=
the other girls’ reactions to them were adorable! this performance was super eye catching
=
This is their concert right?  Cause it feels like one!
=
This is the reaction that I want from other idols in award shows haha 
=
Why wether wheein starts to sing I shout like "goooo wheeein"!!!!!!!
=
Idk why I'm crying I'm just so happy to know them. My precious girls.
=
WHEEIN'S VOICE IS SO CLEAAAAAAAAAAAR
=
I love seeing everyone fangirl over Mamamoo. They're so respected and loved in the industry ❤️❤️❤️
=
Goshhh my queen solar is so charismatic here( nahh i don’t wan’t issues its just Solar is my bias all of them are so charismatic )
=
that Oh my Girl member who said "I dont care on the competition anymore, i just love them" .. is me when I'm already about to lose XD
=
is it just me or Mamamoo just have a concert there?
=
YooA be like "I don't even care about the competition, I love them!" Guizzzz gosh mamamoo
=
Their stage presence is overwhelming
=
I'm totally that girl at 1:07 ><  
And can we all take a moment to appreciate Wheein's singing w/ Moonbyul's rap 
=
Mamamoo Queens, just don't need to go on higheels, they are amazing whatever whey wear and whatever they sing!!
=
Sorry to say this but I dont think that any group from the queendom line up can top Mamamoo's showmanship!! Their vocals are on point, the facial expressions are on point, their dance is on point, everything about this performance was perfect!!
=
I'm so proud of mamamoo because recently they have concert a week before the queendom and wheein say's she is tired but still they perform amazingly and perfectly
=
i love how mamamoo’s #1 because its so fitting because it has such a good intro and it really seemed like a first performance. it compliments the #6 which really looks like a final performance uwu
=
MAMAMOO:
In front of others : Shy, Nervous
Among them : Beagleness, Crazy af
On Stage : Queendom? We already a Queen  MAMAMOO is Coming back for U, So BRING IT ON !!! QUEEN is Back. MAMAMOO so Cool, charming af!!!!! 
=
I love how Solar always touches her body hahaha
=
4:28-4:34 the chemistry of the whole group in just 6 seconds 
=
Although I have watch this video for a countless times, I am still feel amazes with their fantastic, incredible performance like WOW! Mamamoo is just on another level.
=
They got everybody hyped up lmao
=
Oh yes the queens of  performances
=
I've been watching almost every MAMAMOO performance but the feeling never lessen. Its so intense and crazy.
=
I’m crying for park bom I know she misses 2NE1 just by watching mamamoo’s performance
=
mamamoo certainly has that unexplainable stage presence! every single one of them shines through!
=
I always put Mamamoo in a unique category. I never put them in the same category as the other GGs. They are in my LEGENDARY category with SNSD and 2NE1.
=
the amount of love and admiration that their juniors have towards them is the cutest thing ever
=
AHHHH I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM ALL OVER AGAIN  QUEENS 
=
Damn vocal Queens 
I enjoyed every bit of this performances of them.
And yes I felt good!
=
2:32 he's cute tho.....enjoying queen Mamamoo performing
=
no offense, but i want hwasa to step on my neck
=
4:26 They kept showing Seongjun and Sihun and other produceX boys over over like 7 times I see what you doing Mnet but I think I’m the only  one that noticed

Am I??
=
I’m in tears. The vocals 
=
I don't know if I'm watching their concert or Queendom. Just wow. Stanning this group is really the best decision  I made. The vocals just wow.
=
The first time for me to see a slight reaction on bom's face at 3:02 ! Haha 
MMM's  live perf always gives me a 2ne1 vibe.
=
Dont forget guys.. this queen had win immortal song for 3rd times.. overall 12 performances in immortal songs.. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MAMAMOO
=
Whenever MAMAMOO finishes performing, it's like a storm just passed. So powerful! 
=
You know why Mamamoo don't feel the urge to compete? Because they're woke that's not necessary (bc all of them are talented enough), their fans are 96% females they need to take care of them also and have a good representation, third they're too kind for that. Anyway Stan Mamamoo and all these women there <333
Edit: even so that doesn't mean you will not support them on this show or you'll trash on others groups, JUST ENJOY and str/eam.
=
I really don't know much about this group but I became a fan after hearing this. Been playing this for about 20 times now. 
=
I notice wheein is so so gorgeous i love you wheein and the members of mamamoo
=
3:50 solar be like: girls let’s do vocalisation
=
Mamamoo opening the show and setting the bar so high 
=
4:09 she is the only one that seems exited in every performence
=
This is not a competition, this is a concert!!! 
=
AMAZING!
These girls need worldwide recognition...
Do they perform in the states or Europe?
=
3:44 JUNG WHEE IN
=
1:45 is this guy from produce?
=
This performance is so lit!!!!! It actually made me happy watching this!!
=
The girl who said "I don't even care about the competition, I love them" it's just an sweetheart
=
Another Idol : I just got Chills.
Me: I'm completely FROZEN!!! 
=
I REALLY FEEL  GOOD WHILE WATCHING. I JIST SMILE THE WHOLE VIDEO. MAMAMOO IS THE BEST. SORRY FOR BEING LATE IN THE FANDOM.... I LOVE YOU QUEENS ❤
=
AAAAHHH THIS IS INSANELY GOOD!
=
Other gg: going first is bad 
Mamamoo: (goes first) well.. you can put us wherever you like.. we still slay bish! 
=
when you're just trying to appreciate Mamamoo but your internet hates you
=
They sing LiVE everybodyyyyy 
=
Everytime Hwasa and Seolhyun appear my heart stops for a second
=
HWASAAAA STOP CRUSHING ME LIKE THAAAAT ❤️❤️❤️
=
YAAAAASSSSSSS! THAT'S HOW YOU DO LIVE!
=
4:08
same yuqi same 
=
i still get goosebumps every time i hear them sing
=
No less respect to the other performances but Mamamoo the most connected to audiences.clap..clap 
=
Totally different level.
=
Solar has a very charismatic smile... and I just love Moonbyul ❤️
=
OMG Seunghee at 2:07 is literally me. hahaha
=
Their stage presence is amazing!
=
HERE TAKE MY SOUL.
Dayumn it. QUEENS
=
They always sound good live
=
Hwasa ❤
=
I cant stop loving mamamoo even more
=
"Mamamoo is coming back for you" 
i'm-
=
I'M STARTING TO STAN MAMAMOO AND THIS PROVES ME THAT I STAN THE RIGHT GROUP ❤❤❤
=
One thing iconic with mamamoo is that they would constantly talk to the audience while performing.
=
2:35 it's such a mood
=
MAMAMOOOO is the COOLEST Kpop group i have ever seen, hit like if you’re agree!!!
=
OMGGGGGG THEY OWNED THE STAGE!!!
=
I just love their expression when they are singing ❤️
=
From 3:48 and on it really reminded me of their immortal songs stages. They're so good!
=
WTF, Wheein´s voice is so clean! I mean, everybody sounds amazing and breathtakingly, but wheein sounds exactly like on the record!!!!!
=
I thought MAMA was in December
=
0:39 sihoon is that you?
=
Is this a free concert?❤️
This is so good
Everyone is fall in love with Mamamoo
The other group of girls fall in love too
=
the audience are also gorgeous damn hahahaha
=
Let put aside popularity and give mamamoo best girl group at least at one of Korean music award ....
=
Mamamoo are one of the best. Can't fault them.
=
I AM FREAKING OUTTTT ♥️ THIS IS JUST SO MUUUUCH!!!! OMGGGG
=
I love that Soyeon's reactions are always so positive for everyone 
=
every performance of this group is like a concert. 
=
so when is mamamoo coming to the U.S? I will literally travel anywhere to them
=
I always play this every morning so I will feel good for the whole day. This is real mood
=
Really beautiful, I love their voices.
=
Just like their concert!
=
Petition for soyeon and hwasa collaboration 
=
I can never get tired of watching them  queens~
=
Wheein looks seriously pretty in this makeup and outfit
=
I got goosebumps from hearing them sing
=
The Intro really addicted. 
=
this is the moment Da Hee unnie become moomoo...LOL
=
Did i just see sihoon cheering for mamamoo? 
=
they sang live.... omg those vocals... im in love
=
im watching all of these performances and soyeon's excitement in all of them sustains. i love she. yuqi honorable mention too kakak
=
so where do I sign up for the fandom
=
Yuqi shouting 'I WILL! I WILL! I WILL!!!’ when Mamamoo sang the part with the lyrics ‘Trust myself to you’ is a whole mood!
=
I'm SHOOKETH
=
No doubt, all the girl groups presented here are amazing and have great talent _(being a multi-fandom)_ but the level of interaction and involvement Mamamoo has with the audience is just unparalleled. It's so engaging, it's more than just a performance 
=
I loved Jimin's reaction 2:22
=
Literally no one in the industry can STAND near Mamamoo, their stage presence is out of this world
=
2:06 Seunghee is me lmaoo!
=
4:01 the camera wasn't on her, but I heard that note
=
1:10 our BDC guys getting more screen time here than in PdX101
=
ive literally fallen in love with every group on this show i cant stop watchinggg omg
=
We need cl of 2ne1 to join this  too❤️
=
They always SLAY my existence WHY?!!
=
It would be an overkill if it were Piano Man
=
50% of the comments: sihun/bnm boys/pdx101


they were here as special judges along with other trainees
=
I'M CRYING THEYRE SO GOOD. I HAD GOOSEBUMPS FOR THE WHOLE VIDEO
=
stan talented QUEEN ❤
=
OMG SO AMAZINGGGG!!!!!
=
Hwasa starting that out while squatting was so iconic. the power she has, the aura she exudes, the emotions she express, the way she sings is BEYOND PERFECTION. NO ONE IS DOING IT LIKE HER
=
I REALLY LOVE MAMAMOO THEY'RE SO PRECIOUS I CAN'T IM CRYING
=
i love how mamamoo is so chill in this show lmao
=
I just want to marry Wheein
=
1:27 omg solar you're killing me 
=
The fact that every member can literally be a main vocalist, even Moonbyul who is a rapper is a decent singer also. I’m glad that they are being recognized now since last year and they gained so much popularity until then.
=
I keep coming back for reaction from crowd.
=
every stage is a concert and i love it
=
One of  favorites song in mamamoo ♡
=
I'm getting *goosebumps* till the end of the song
=
mamamoo knows how to put up a show.
=
Goosebumps all the time!
=
MAMAMOO performance is very good. I really like this show.
=
Our Talented Queens✨✨
=
Treasures, thank you mamamoo

How many times I watch this, I always goosebumps.. Wow
=
To this day this song continues to give me goosebumps
=
A big clap for Mamamoo!! I feel so good!! their vocals and stage performance are so powerful mygosh.
=
They're showing "The Queen Is BACK!!!"
=
Fangirls of MAMAMOO just showed up
=
Ok, I just saw Jimin's reaction after moonbyul's rap and that expression was disgust. Did she really did that? lol
=
They're really can sing 
=
I love mamamoo forever!!!❤️❤️❤️
=
Is there KIM SIHOON sitting in the hall, or did it seem to me ??
0:39 2:13
=
im gonna be real, MMM legit are sUCH aMaZING performers bc they rly are able to hype up their audience so well
=
The harmonies 
=
Omg...this brought tears to my eyes. <3
=
Can I say I this ia so strong! Its like a concert! HAIL!!!
=
Hwasa's stage presence is really out of this world. She is so amazing.
=
Out of question.... Is it only me who felt that the audience (boy's) are so cute even their reaction!!!! 
=
Remember their performance at 2016 MELON MUSIC AWARDS it was epic 
=
I feel goosebumps all over my body!!!! I am so happy every time I see their performance !
=
I thought that was spiderman into the spider-verse music  intro 
=
They do enjoy sexy concept 
And anyway, seeing them in full clothes is a little bit "weird" to me 
But still, love it!!
=
I'm back after we won 
=
Put mamamoo as the opening act to any concert and all will be fine In MMM we trust!
=
This made me seriously want to go to one of their concerts. I can only imagine the type of performance they put out. Like why do i only get to see them perform this grandly on award shows and here when i could see it in concert
=
Lee dae hee reaction ❤
=
proud of what MAMAMOO is achieving and im so happy that they're being recognized by their talents alone. proud MOOMOO since 2014 
=
*QUEENS SLAYING* 
=
Don't forgot to show wheein some love with soar 
=
Everyone is the *VISUAL* U CANT CHANGE MY MIND
=
2:35 That it :)
=
Hwasa 
=

=
Idk why this girls always remind me 2ne1 performance
=
THE REAL QUEENS OF SEXY AND HARMONY ❤️
=

=
Simplesmente iconis do k-pop elas são perfeitas ❤️
=
Slaying every performance 
=
Wheein with long hair issa mood
=
Shout out to those dancers. They literally accompanied mamamoo to their concert in daegu and danced 4 hrs for two consecutive days and then went straight back to seoul tgt wif mamamoo for this queendom recording!!! Lets appreciate their efforts too! It must be tiring as hell cause rbw be using the same dancers for literally every mamamoo performance.
=
The best group for me
=
Damn Im so inlove with hwasa ❤️ 
Im now doubting my sexuality hahaha
Mamamoo’s the only Idol that I know all the members name. Im not really good with remembering the names of the idols, I just know the names of my favorites in the group
=
I love how they sing how they want to sing and not follow the CD/ original audio. Yes!
=
THE PEOPLE REALLY NEEDS STAN MAMAMOO
=
3:27 im gay for moonbyul
=
Is this a mini concert? Omg.
=
Best Korean Girl group. I am not open for discussions bye.
=
This is making my head tingle in a pleasant way... Goosebumps on my temples?
=
0:39 some Produce x 101 trainees were watching
=
Seeing Soyeon scream for them is enjoyable❤️❤️❤️
=
Best of the Best!! So natural on stage!
=
Hwasa doesn't even have to do anything, her staring is 1000x the stage presence already
=
3:22 
Soyeon a adorable baby ❤
=
Seriously it's next level.
=
watching for the 100th time 
=
Bro if you didn’t like this performance then there is something wrong bro

=
CONGRATS MAMAMOO! THEY SLAYED EVERYONE FROM THE VERY START AND JUST WON! PROBABLY GONNA WAIT FOR THEIR MAMA 2019 PERFORMANCE HUHUHUU!

=
Hwasa has the most unbelievable stage presence. She has this aura and charisma just amazing.
=
I *love* their perfomances !!
=
i watch this video every day ever since it was posted to help me boost my confidence
=
I must say i prefer listening to mamamoo's live performance because everytime they perform my brain always sing the live version especially when hwasa say"scream" and then moonbyul "make some noise"
=
Like concert! 
=
Goosebumps!
=
For Me This Is The IKONIC 
=
Decalcomanie will always be my favorite song, i mean i loved all their songs. but Decalcomanie just got that impact that always makes me want to jump and screaming their name. amazing mammoo!!
=
i'm gei for Moonbyul. Help meeeeeeeeee <3
=
They really are on another level ..
=
"Stop being fabulous". Please girls the stage is their rules. We just seeing spectacular performance.

=
MAMAMOO IS JUSTA DIFFERENT TYPE OF BREED.ONLY THEIR PERFORMANCES GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS
=
What’s more impressive then them with this amazing performance and also live? The fact that before filming this they were performing at their concert which meant these girls are tired and vocals are tired of signing so much but you can’t even tell
=
Moonbyul is so stiff i love it 
=
4:28 THAT DAMN HARMONY IS SO CLEAN.
=
Galdly entering moomoodom after watching Queendom Lol

=

=
Legend 
=
Somebody call 911 I think am gonna die!
=

=
It would’ve been cool if Mamamoo did a cover like the other groups
=
YASSSSS QUEENNN!!!!!!
=
Concert vibes! Goodjob mamamoo!! ♥️
=
Hwasa's stage presence is on another level. She is the Queen of Koop.
=
This reminds me of 2NE1 red uniforms and the blue one for their concert and performances. It’s just that it looks like a Girls generation version 
=
Mamamoo ♡
=
Vocal queens❤️❤️
=
I can see how they all have a crush for hwasa... I FEEL YOU ALL!!
=
"I don't care about the competition, I love them" 
=
Kim sihoon caught my attention
=
Honestly, I feel like Mamamoo should've won first. I enjoyed G(Idle)'s performance, but they lack stage presence. I loved their choreo which is something Mamamoo doesn't have - they're focused more on theatrics. But Mamamoo has everything else, natural stage presence, vocals, and they entertain not just perform. I actually enjoy watching these performances. It's so fun and you see the difference in the group's experience. AOA and Mamamoo exudes stage charisma and self-confidence which I think some of the newer group's lack. For Bom, I think it's just unnerving to be on the stage on her own. Overall, all groups were a joy to watch!
=
Let's admit it, whether you are mamamoo fans or not YOU ARE STILL THEIR FANS
=
I'm sorry but I've seen my boys
Kim Si Hoon, Hong Sung Joon, Yoon Jung Hwan and they have more screentime here than Pdx101. :,>
=
2:12 sihoon :o
2:32 it is sihoon T. T
=
I think I found new group Im going to stan after 2NE1 
=
Other groups doesn't want to go first because they want the last position cause they say its the "trendiest idol" position. Only mamamoo chose to go first even though they also want the last position they just wish that people will still remember their performance even though they go first.

PRESSURE: HERE I COME
=
this live.....omg
=
I am really seeing sihunn hahahah
=
MAMAMOO has been giving the best performances during this show!  Their vocals, creativity, energy, dances! Not saying other groups haven’t done well but MAMAMOO is the complete package! THEY DESERVE MORE
=
I wanna scream MAMAMOO!!!!! they too cool im gonna have a panick attack!!! 2ne1 and Mamamoo are two reasons why i still follow korean groups
=
Wohaaa ilovethem
=
Increíble presentación =D !!!
=
OMGGGGG. Mamamoo's sexiness is overflowing even without them trying it's just soooo natural plus the talent is undeniable
=
Lmaoo seongjun be getting more screentime here than in produce
=
2:13 Kim sihun?
=
0:39 sihoon produce x 101? right??. omg i miss him
=
Hwasaa..
Love u....
=
the guy at 2:33 ahhhhhhhhh❣️
=
Who among you saw Kim Sihoon from PDX101 watching Mamamoo? ✋
=
Wht I love about mamamoo is how they can engage the audience with their performance. Even if they're not their fans, they can make those audience enjoy their performance
=
I think this is more than concert version or award show of decalcomanie. It just so so so amazing
=
this is the first time me seeing discrete number of boys enjoying mamamoo's stage ahahahhahah
=
It's a concert clip. It's a concert clip. It's  a concert clip.
=
The difference between MAMAMOO and other groups is that they always perform like it's their concert!!!!
=
LOVE YOU MAMAMOOOOOO
=
2:22 Same
=
I'm going to be real here, this wasn't their best or grandest performance by any means, they had no real time to prepare something new and were dead tired from their concerts the day before. And yet they ranked fairly well which means people are that starved when it comes to good live performances. Now imagine if mamamoo actually got some time to prepare a real stage
=
LET ME JUST SAY,,, I MISS BNMBOYS(pdx101)  SO MUCH 
=
who is he? 1:45 ...i'm in love XD
=
I love mamamoo
I see Brand new PDx101 
=
The queen of vocalist
=
why are those boys that are watching them are sooo handsome?
=
Is this even a competition?? Seems more like their mini concert! 
=
when showing the audience, mnet be showing sihoon
=
STREAM HIP!!!
=
The vocal harmonies are insane
=
MY QUEEEENSSSSS
=
4:27 brandnew boys
=

=
Wheein's voice is like GOLD, DIAMOND, whatever that is precious.
=
Mamamoo really out there stopping gg fanwar
=
I love you mamamoo from the core of my heart
=
Oh just notice brandnew members 
=
4.26...i think these boys from produce x 101 but I can’t remember their name..the ones in the audience......correct me if i was wrong...btw good to see them again
=
Idk why but i want to kiss and hug them so much...
=
Woahh anjir mantul 
=

=
Saranghaeeeee 
=
Yunseong!!!!❤️
=
Came back after they won the finale! They're soooooo 
=
I want to go to their concert
=
this intro... beyonce vibes
=
Being gay and being gay for mamamoo are two different things 
=
Where can I watch the full episode for this??
=
What a beautiful performance and handsome fanboys
=
Hwasa is the best, the most calm and most natural in live and stage performanes. She knows how to kill it! Daebak!
=
Damn hwasa didn’t have to slay so hard in the beginning 
Mamamoo slaying as usual
=
3:21 Soyeon is soo cute
=
I love voice the girl with pink suit
=
Weeks had passed and Im still here, Yuup  guessed im obsessed already
=
PROUD MOOMOO
=
I'll never get over how good their live vocals are omg 
=
好帅好帅好帅！！！！
=
The fanboys being caught on camera are the cutest, they look likw k-idols hahaha
=
i'm just focused in ex trainee produce x 101
=
1:10 wowwwweeeee SOLAR
=
My first girl crush is 2ne1. Now I stand mamamoo 
=
When you can't see there are* back dancers until the song is finished...
=
Mamamoo is the best. They're vocals are so powerful and they also remind me of 2ne1.
=
❤❤❤
=
really like their voice....
=
Im very proud of them, MAMAMOO,  the only Group the Every member is your Bias
=
*Is that Sihoon from pdx101??* OMAYGADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
=
this show was made for mamamoo; they are the queens and this is their queendom
=
*MAMAMOO THE BEST* ♥♥33
=
0:39 bnm boys
=
いちいち楽屋にいる奴の反応写すのだるい…
パフォーマンス見させろよ…
=
Female idols supporting female idols  This show is the proof that idols are not to be compared, but rather appreciated. Let us appreciate every queen in and out this show 
=
IM IN LOVE WITH MAMAMOO
THEY'RE SO COOL AND UNIQUE
HOW CAN THEY PERFORMED SO PERFECT IM CRYING 
MAMAMOO THE QUEEN！！！！
I DON'T REALLY CARE THEY WIN OR NOT 
THEY'RE ALREADY QUEEN！
=
i love how they and g-idle  are not lip syncing like the others, thats talent luv
=
Not gonna lie, MAMAMOO's the only few artist that can gave me goosebumps on their EVERY performance
=
MY QUEENNNNNNNNN
=
Once Hwasa started it was wrap
=
Goosebumpssss
=
I ❤ you mamamoo
=
After 2Ne1 , only Mamamoo bite me!.... Good luck in Queendom girls!
=
long story short: everyone of your favs is secretly a mamamoo fan
=
I'm so whipped for this istg-
=
❤
=
lemme marry wheein please.
=
they don't come to play
=
guys i dunno but Moonbyul somehow is like T.O.P's female version...the deep voice, rap prowess, being conservative..lol 
=
Did I just saw sihoon on the audiences?
=
what MAMAMOO can't do? 
1. lip sync
=
So much hook for this group 
=
yaaas omg i saw some of the pdx101 boys!!!!!!! bnm boys are thereeee
=
now this is the real performance!
=
Ok now who is that idol with sleepy n tired looking face in the waiting room?
=
is it sihoon that i saw
=
Got hooked to Mamamoo coz of this! I seriously thought they were holding a concert here when later found out it's a competition show! OMG they're seriously good!! 
=
I love mamamoo but wasn't the performance about having something a little different than normal? I can see them doing this at a regular show. Still brilliant. But was expecting something different
=
Wasn’t that sihoon from pdx in the audience or am I going crazy
=
LEARN HOW TO HOLD THE INSTRUMENTS PROPERLY I SWEARR but love to mamamoo,, the beginning with the “drumline” and “trumpets” just irked me :(
=
Did I just saw Sihoon from pdx101? 
=
THE GUY IS SIHOON FROM PX101?
=
❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
For other girl groups it feels like a competition, but with Mamamoo's performance, it feels like they're owning it as a concert!!!!!
=
Really just gonna say this
Back up dancer @ 0:16 failed
=
Im a blackjack but i also want to support this group since they always respect park bom and 2ne1 and i can also see them as 2nd 2ne1 more than blackpink tho hahaha
=
I love themmmmmm
=
❤❤❤
=
Knpa penonton nya cogan semua :)
=
Wait, are those PDX101 trainees? 
Cuz im distracted on their pretty faces.
=
Moonbyul snapped during her part HARD
=
My queens 
=
Ok I think I’m gonna faint if they do that ever again
=
0:40 is that kim sihoon from producex101 ???
=
For me, MAMAMOO topped the GG with most stage presence. Damn, they can be in Coachella and hype that crowd.
=
i think that blonde boy 0:39 is from produce x 101 brand new music i just think?
=
solar's face is so refreshing
=
Mamamoo: i feel good
"OK! I WILL!!"
=
Who wants a Mamamoo World Tour?? We're ready for it
=
Goddesses 
=
Mnet please can we get a special episode once park bom and all the groups comeback where they will perform their comebcak songs
=
Hhhhh i feel all the fanboys are super handsome
=
Mamamoo can bring any set of their concert to this show. This is such a good performance.
=
who is 2:08 ? its like me everytime i see mamamoo
=
they don't even lipsync!
=
I really should attend one of their concert. I can't stop watching
=
WheeIn's wink at 4:14 has absolutely murdered me.
=
I miss this mamamoo era. I got chills throughout the entire performance and Hwasa is officially hype man of the melanin people MELANIUM ❤❤❤❤
=
Mamamoo always the best
=
Who is him??? Name
1:44
=
wow this is super powerhouse. This happens when you get all the lead vocals in one group.
=
son tan lindas :(
=
IT FEELS LIKE A CONCERT OMG SLAYYYYYT
=
QUEENSSSSSSS~!! 
=
This is the truly Queen y'all fight meee!!! MAMAMOO is the next Queen after 2NE1 
=
Fix! Ini nah berasa nonton konsernya Mammoo... 
=
I love u Mamamoo
=
How could anyone even imagine of surpassing Mamamoo????? The winning throne is reserved for Mamamoo and only Mamamoo!
=
wow produce x 101  trainees in the audience section
=
3:44
=
they have powerful voices
=
But the question is why their fanboys are so hot??
=
SO GLAD TO SEE OT4 PERFORM SO WELL LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO!! MAMAMOO LET’S ALL BE HEALTHY 
=
Ig man in video??
=
I hope this show could make our radish farm expand. More XY moomoo?? :33
=
Was it just me, or did anyone else think for a second at the beginning that they were going to do an After School song?
=
申智珉和文星伊快产生爱情了
=
At 0:39 and 4:26 , perhaps i saw Brand New Music 's guys. 
=
And with that one move, Solar wrecked the internet.
=
This was literally the best song to do for this-it’s probably their most popular aside from Yes I Am and it has the line “MAMAMOO is coming back for you” like...is that not beyond perfect for a comeback battle show??
Not surprised they won.
=
mamamoo: true performers
=
I'm gay for these girls. Mamamoo, come to the Philippines! I'll definitely watch your concert if ever.
=
Moonbyul can make straight males Gay.
=
Who are those boys audience? I feel like some of them are familiar to me but I cant recognise who
=
them girl groups being stronger than them boy groups
=
Produce x 101? I saw sihoon i think
=
I watch this every day 2 or 3 times not even kidding
=
0:33
=
THEY. ARE. NOT. YOUR. AVERAGE. GIRL GROUP. SINCE DEBUT!!!
=
they can step rally on me.
=
Mamamoo 
=
Okay we're not talking about the idols or trainees who came? I saw Brand New Music Boys..
=
So this is what TALENT looks like ❤ MAMAMOO
=
they don't need a concept or decorate the stage. Their presences  are enough to burn the stage
=
Excellent!
=
Is that sihun from pdx101 and brand new music or what
=
they need world tour! read that again
=
Also G-idle really won first place?? I mean
=
This is a bloody concert as expected  LEGGOOOOOO!!!

Am still sad that they didn't show Wheein's part in the 2nd verse & skipped to Byul's rap tho 
=
Mamamoo unnie daebak..  
=
2:22
=
Mamamoo is one true LEGEND in Kpop industry, you who said the otherwise can meet me at 4pm i'll fight u
=
I'm a fan of 2ne1..  But this group has a great voice/vocals
=
For me they are the winner, other performances were really cool especially g idle, but shocks their performance feels like a concert. They make the audience go shout.
=
When Hwasa says scream, I literally SCREEEEAAAAAAAMMMMM! 
=
ムンビョルのラップにやるやんって顔するジミンがまじたまらん
=
their vocals are no joke! one of the best vocal groups in kpop
=
They are indeed QUEENS
=
They are indeed QUEENS
=
Kim sihun  I see you
=
Lee da hee 
=
its hard to perform after them. . puts a lot of pressure. . they really are awesome
=
I can say proudly that MAMAMOO is the best group in K-POP with all the members having equal strength in everything and second to none....yes, i said NONE!
=
Is there kim sihun?
=
i dont care who will be the winner in this compertition. MMM  won my heart anyway  :)) QUEENS SLAYYYYYYY
=
Hwasa verry sexy i love u
=
Am I the only one who noticed Sihun is watching MAMAMOO performace??
=
เหนือสิ่งอื่นใดดด คนที่เข้างานไปดูคือหล่อมากกกกกกก
=
Mamamoo destroys everybody with their Vocals and Star performance! Holy Crap! i wanted to cry! Its soo good
=
“i don’t even care about competition, i love them” THATS SO CUTE AWHDBDJAJ
=
"I don't even care about competition. I love them." AWWWWWWWW
=
I don't even care who wins,every girl idol is a queen! Mamamoo? Queens! AOA? Queens! (G)I-dle? Queens! Lovelyz? Queens! Oh my girl? Queens! Park Bom? Queen!
=
Mamamoo
Bom

=
I cant help but keep coming back everyday.... MAMAMOOOOOOO

=
I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
=
2:07 WHO IS SHE?? She’s so cute~  when she goes “YOOOW” and I love her reactions to the other performances as well. 
=
dont fight me, this is the queen of all girlgroups. vocal, visual, stage presence.
=
1:44 who is he? I'm in love >_<
=
watching this at 2 am, I feel good. I can sleep good
=
WHEEIN BABIE I MISSED YOU
=
4:28 killed me
=
"I don't care about the competition anymore. I LOVE THEM" nicely said sweetie 
=
Is this even a competition to begin with or MAMAMOO's concert? I love all the contestant on this competition. But we cannot deny the fact that MAMAMOO isn't here to compete but to have their mini concert <3
=
I’ve probably said it a million times but...
I love, LOVE, L.O.V.E, EVOLx99999999999 Mamamoo ❤️
=
This is lit
=
4:26 junghwan, seongjun, and sihoon lol

=
0:39 Kim Sihoon from produce x 101
=
Vocal queens! ❤❤❤
=
Can't wait for mamamoo to perform one of 2nel songs  I think that would be lit 
=
Goosebumps the whole performance OMG!!! 
P.S. i cant resist pausing the video every time KIM SIHOON is caught on cam  i miss him
=
0:39 is that Kim Sihun from pdx101
=
i got a goosebumps, really!!! They're amazing
=
im in love with their hair
=
I just love the way MAMAMOO shows their passion in stage. Every MMM member is so different from each other and talented at the same level. Best girlgroup when it comes about VOCALS and STAGE PRESENCE. Also their charisma, did you guys heard the fanchant??? Queens already  Actually my fav girlgroup, they got my heart easily.
=
THE PRESENCE SCREAMS 2NE1 :( I MISS MY OT4
=
And there is Lee Da Hee being the most successful moomoo having the Vip standing out there watching her Idols slaying it.
=
Yassss we agreeee we alll rr QWEEENNNNNNNNSS 2:36
=
Produce x 101 contestants was there. Omoooo. SiHun
=
OMG , these reactions !!!
Had to screenshot 0:24 and 3:46 ... isn't it Jiae ?
Looks sooo cute, when she leaves our world to an unknown universe .....
=
Yooa is so cute watching Mamamoo.
=
0:39 is that Kim Sihun?
=
I SEE SIHUN FROM BNM OMG 
=
Heu heu sihoon is got me shock when he appear
=
mamamoo makes me question my sexuality, but then there's the pdx boys.... 
=
Very entertaining and a vocally powerful performance!!! One of the best!!
=
かっこよすぎる
=
I could not breathe while watching them perform
=
0:39 and 2:13
=
I love Mamamoo so hard.
=
QUEEEEEEEEN 
=
Cada día me enamoro más de estas maravillosas chicaaas ♥️
=
Seolhyun so pretty
=
i already got goosebumps from the very beginning of this video omg!!!
=
Everytime i see moonbyul i doubt my sexuality
=
MAMAMOO is the best one their stage presence is really amazing especially HWASA. She has such an amazing stage presence.
=
Little mix and mamamoo are the real queens.
=
Gosh I didn't realize how much I miss Wheein's presence and her voice!!
=
Those cute guys, are they an idol group our something?
=
Mamamoo just finished their 2 days concert, after that practiced for Queendom. All of these is in 3 days time. QUEENS only.
=
Oh My Girls are all so nice and supportive. Love them.
=
04:00
=
I swear I keep seeing boys from produce x 101!!? @2:13
=
Happy bday to sihoon
=
Why are Hong Seonjun and KIm Sihun in the audience? lmao
=
Aku merasa mamamo akan menang ,aminnnnnnnn
=
anyone see the produce trainees in the audience shots
=
I saw lee dahee. Well, she is Moomoo president
=
Although I'm not a stan, this song is probably one of my fave kpop songs! I never get tired of their perf
=
Mamamoo slayed it as always, song is Decalcomanie.  Hwasa: honey blond (or golden brown) hair, Wheein: dark brown (or black) hair, Moonbyul: light hair, Solar: black hair. I became a MooMoo (fan) in 2018 and they have the best live vocals of any girl group. Mamamoo has been working super hard & deserves a break, vacation, they are queens.
=
"I don't think I can sit next to them" Same Soyeon, SAME
=
this reminds me of BANG, aaaaaa ❤️❤️❤️
=
You can see how powerful they are whenever they perform ❤️ vocal queens are amazing
=
Ahhhhhh I REALLY LOVE THEM ALL
=
i keep having goosebumps whenever i see Mamamoo perform.
=
I wanna see them perform live so baaaad . I love you my queens 
=
here for 4 times
hawsa still my favorite
=
Someone : mamamoo 
My reaction: 2:07
=
3:00 
That Girl said everything 
"Stop Being so fabulous please"
=
The fact that this performance was the day after their concert blows my mind!!
=
OMGGG!! NO WORDS!!
=
Best ever ❤
=
That's how you perform 
=
perfect..i love them
=
2:36 MOOD
=
Those drums reminds me of After School 'Bang', sigh, now i miss them
=
0:38 jIhoon and the other two trainee pdx was spotted
=
4:26 i saw you sihun..
=
Hey brandnewmusic trainee there
=
OMGGG that Mamamoo your patrons
=
I AM SO GAYYYYYY FOR THESE QUEENS THEY SLAYED
YUQI AND SHUSHU HAD VERY QQ REACTIONS UWU
=
Knp gue salfok sama sihoon pdx101 y
=
look at our sihoon boy there supporting queens ❤️
=
Is it me or the fanboys look good af
=
Hwasa's charisma is very in high level
=
#MAMAMOO XD
=
I just saw the BNM guy from producex101
=
thought its bang bang by afterschool haha
=
How do I choose my permanent bias? Moonbyul is my first love but Wheein is peeking 
=
I can see Junghwan, Sihoon and others Produce trainee there.
=
We love queens SUPPORTING and LOVING other queens
=
ughhhhh so good!!
=
Hi, let me guys know what is the concept of this show, and who takes part
=
Bnm trainees omy
=
Queens of Korea
=
Wheein-ah!!!
=
*this looks like mamamoo's concert*


i saw kim sihoon and yoon junghwan  uwu
=
I am getting goosebumps. This is THE group.
=
i'm not wrong to stan mamamoo
This is the real QUEEN!!
=
Can we take time and appreciate Wheein's background vocals while Byul was rapping???
=
Mamamoo 
=
Gidle fan fangirling is everything.  Mamamoo ×Gidle moments
=
My Queen!!!
=
THEY ARE LIVE SING %100
 NOT %20-30
 QUEEN YESSSS MMM
THEY ARE ANOTHER LEVEL !!!!!
=
All the performers in this show were of a high standard, but seriously, MAMAMOO take live performances to a level very few groups could ever attain. I felt for soloist Park Bom. I feel that she was just wishing that she could perform on stage with MAMAMOO, especially Wheein. They have great mutual respect for each other. Bom's experience immediately recognises a singer of quality.
=
guys, after this show I will shipper Moonmin
=
They always bang the stagee luv u mamamoo♡♡
=
My queeeens 
=
I love hwasa man...btw..they all rocked the pink outfits....mamomoo my ultimate bias group❤❤❤
=
 mamamoo awesome!!!!
=
Sana mag-guest sila sa showtime para magpromote ng concert sa Sept 21
=
were they really did a performance or a concert?
=
coming back to watch this after 3 days and man... doesn't matter which girl group you like, heck doesn't even matter which boy group. but you can't deny mamamoo has the best live vocals out of.. well.. everyone.
=
I love how the other ggs are just fangirling over mamamoo <3
=
"I don't think I can sit with them." me too girl, me too.
=
They are such a professional and great performers. Salute!!!
=
I love yuqi’s reactions
=
Go QUEENS!  This is why I love Mamamoo. So much talents.
=
Am in love with Hwasanim
=
4:27 Wheein’s solo with Solar and Hwasa’s blending I CAN’T GET ENOUGH ❤️❤️❤️
=
I see kim sihoon ex pdx and brand new boys 
=
DAMN THIS GIRLS . THE POWER THEY HAVE 
=
After 2 wks, we finally reached 4 M lol. Meanwhile, good luck did about 2 M in 24 h 
=
Why do I get the same feeling when watching 2ne1 whenever these ladies perform? I mean, the stage presence. Gawd.
=
Just Mamamoo bringing it to every stage as always
=
0:39 my baby kim sihyun happy to see u
=
Can somebody talk about the producex101 trainees enjoying our queens stage ❤️❤️
=
2:10 who else just absolutely loves moonbyul’s part here?
=
This is what a great live performance is suppose to sound like ! I'm not a fan but I always watch their performance ! They never disappoint !
=
Solar has been upping her sexy and I'm scared for my health bc I'm just a useless bisexual solar stan
Halp
=
@1:11 who are these fine looking men?!?
=
WHY IS EVERYBODY SO PRETTY YOU CANT JUST BE THAT ALL THE TIME HMPPP
=
1:11 Brand New Music Boys
=
YooA said it!! And I think it would make Mamamoo proud. “I don’t care about the competition, I just love them!”
=
It is a concert already! Every mamamoo's performance is very great.
=
im a men and moonbyul in my boyfriend aghhh
=
I just really want to attend a show to see Mamamoo live
=
Their voice alone is enough to make me go awe
=
In this video Hwasa just LOVES her hair
=
Oh my gosh I'm now certified Moonbyul  fan 
=
Wow ! the 're vocal is soooooo amazing ! I got goosebumps
=
I want full version of they perfomance dongss 
=
I came back to check the eng translation 
=
love this show so much we love girls supporting girls
=
Ok I need a how many times they touch their hair count
=
0:39 PDX101 Sihoon? Brandnewmusic trainees?
=

I see alot of produce x 101 trainees. Anyways mamamoo were amazing!
=
The best comment on Naver, "Mamamoo just being a Mamamoo". There's another level after Good, Best, Better, and it's Mamamoo.
=
I mean what's wrong with Mnet,he kept filming good looking boys on the crowd.
=
I just love how they made the audience participate
=
Ellas ponen a dudar a cualquiera ❤
=
OKAY BUT WHY ARE THE BOYS IN THE CROWD CUTE
=
Did I saw it right? I saw Kim yohan and other PDX101 trainees watching at the audience??
=
why do i feel like there were some male idol or trainees amongst the crowd
=
Am i the only one thinking who are those handsome boys in the crowd?
=
MNET with their evil editing again distracting my eyes with those random cute guys in the audience
=
Goosebumps every where in my body ........even parts where I never even knew we can get goosebumps ❤❤❤❤ omg I love them sooo soooo sooooo soosooooooo much
=
I never stan vocals this much...
Along with Taeyeon, Ailee, these Girls are also a treasures...

Good thing about stanning a dozen groups is that you don't have to pick.
That said when it comes to PARTY... Mamamoo knows how to have a Good Time!
=

=
They went offfff. This was so good
=

=
Vocall queenssss
=
0:38 SIHOOOOONNNN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! T-T
=
They're so cool
=
KIM SIHUN IS ALIVE THO HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
=
this just proves that you dont need to have great dancers/visuals in your group to succeed. obviously not saying they cant dance that they arent beautiful. but i feel like a lot of groups these days focus too much on other things besides actual singing.
=
Great performance 
=
Who's the best?
Mamamoo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
MAMAMOO please take me 
=
2:12 he looks familiar, that guy in blue. Anyone who knows that guy?
=
0:39 Kim Sihun ????
=
Am i trippin? Cause i see the Produce X 101 contestant in the audience?? I see Sihoon from BrandNew Music.. did anyone else notice this?? 
=
0:07 Our president Moo is there for MAMAMOO 
I’m so happy
=
why i see sihoon from pdx101 at 0.40? is that really him
=
I JUST WANNA KNOW WHO IS THE GUY AT 1:45
=
Yooa: I don't even care about the competition! I love them
Me: Same girl same
=
Every audience is men and when expose to camera are handsome
=
Rep: Who do you want to avoid? 
Everyone: MAMAMOO 
MAMAMMOO: Kills the stage
=
Hwasa's confidence and charisma just shines on stage, that girl is the dictionary definition of stage presence
=
I just realize their flag represent each one of them.. that so good..
=
MAMAMOO SUPER COOL 
=
Decalcomanie is the go to song to hype the audience and bring out their showmanship and girl crush side
=
U just make the world amazing
=
Aku tu ga bosen nonton ini napayaaa
=
Goosebumps throughout their performance...  Moomoo are proud of our talented Queens
=
I love them all
=
Can some one comment can't you guys see produce X 101 contestant in the audience
=
1:21 - “ i don’t think i can sit next to them! “
*i can’t sit in the same room-*
=
I always love their live performance wherever and whenever... 
=
I'm crying rn. This is one of the songs that made me go back into being a kpop fan. Gahd. My Queens will never disappoint.
=
The stage presence reminds me of 2NE1.
I loved it!
=
Every performance of Mamamoo seems like a concert 
=
This is the first time I watched any video about this group. My friend did a good job introducing them to me. hahaha. need to thank her for this
=
PLS HYPE THIS UP MORE
=
the x1 eliminated trainee's ahhh
=
they snatched my soul
=
I like this !! So lit haha
=
Hwasa was trending on Uk Twitter, which is what brought me straight here
=
Rainhas Absolutas!♡
=
YES MY QUEENS SLAY
=
mamamoo blows everyone out of the water bro this is flawless
=
They can hype up any crowd. :)
=
Cannot help but notice BNM boys on the crowd❤️
=
the x1 eliminated trainee's ahhh
=
JUNG WHEEIN MY QUEEN
=
Amazing as always
=
MOONBYUL GOD I LOVE YOU AAAFRBFUASIOBTS PRINCE CHARMING OVER HERE
=
 we love the support
=
I'm not even suprised for mamamoo amazing perfomance.. Because Its MAMAMOO dear
=
Waaah Mamamoooo~!!!! So greeaaat ~! 
=
I keep seeing produce x 101 trainees on the audience. Or is it just me?
=
=
Wuahhhh❤
=
i love mamamoo sssooooo mmuucchhhh!!!!
=
Wow... Their vocals are awesome ❤️❤️❤️I like their voices 
=
Yooa and Soyeon being a mood thru the whole video
=
Proud of my girls
=
mamamo always slay the stage
=
Mamamoo's vocals are just *Chefs kiss* beautiful
=
the audience are all handsome & beautiful. Are they idols or sumthin?
=
No girl groups can reach Mamamoos' level  personal opinion. PERIOD ✌️ they deserve every daesang 
=
real artists omg...they never do lips sync.
=
Ya!! I saw produce x101
=
1:43
=
goosebumps..
=
It's look like a concert 
=
goosebumps
=
No puedo.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I almost cried
=
Now I can see why people really like them, they are very talented vocalist
=
Is that sihoon pdx101?!
=
0:32 jisoo look alike from BLACKPINK
=
Kim Sihun 00:39 y 4:25 bebé lo extraño mucho❤️
=
I just love how humble MAMAMOO is in this show. Every time there’s a sense of awkward tension due to the competition, I just feel like MAMAMOO is always there to break that, which I really appreciate. The fact that they voluntarily chose to perform 1st for the sake of the other groups really proves they don’t care about rankings! They‘re not sucked into this whole ‘competition’ vibe, they just came on this show to do what they love most, which is to perform! So much respect for them!
=
oh my got. i am not fan but it is very amazing. Woah very good.
=
Im gay for moonbyul 
What is being straight 
Never met her
=
i literally watch this everyday and still got goosebumps everytime hwasa start the song like- DAMN MA
=
Give Wheein's Goodbye MV a view after you finish watching this ^^
=
I ALMOST CRIED!!!!!!  THIS IS WHAT WE CALL TALENT GUYS! WHO'S WITH ME? ❤
=
How many times did hwasa touched her hair?
=
I DIED. GOOD LUCK TO Y'ALL.
=
Why/all of the audience are so handsome?
=
The only problem is this clip misses the first 3 seconds or so where we see a few groups shocked at the mamamoo intro. Watch the actual episode 1 for those reactions!!
=
This is why MAMAMOO is in the top list of girl group list :)

Edit: wow in so much likes?! Almost to 400?! Wow ☺️
=
Who are the boys??????
Idol
=
The next 2ne1 level. Is mamamoo.
=
kok gue kayak ngeliat trainee.bnm ya , si sihun hmm
=
fiquei sem ar por uns segundos
=
Is it me or I see trainees from PDX 101 everywhere?
=
Mamamoo makes me gay
=
Did I really saw Kim Sihoon At @0:39 ???
=
HWASAAAAA ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
=
Anyone know the boys ?
=
2:12-2:21 Can we appreciate Wheein's ad-libs here?? It really gives more emotion and nicely complements Byul's rap<3
=
I feel like, even if you just seat beside them, they will eat u alive.
=
comment section here is much more peaceful than the aoa one...
=
Seunghee's "YOW" cracked me up lmao
=
So good !!  Okay now I'm excited for mamamoo's second performance on queendom  leggo!!
=
Jimin reaction when moonbyul rap is worthy 
=
1:07 her reaction so cute 
=
i love this concept of girl groups loving girl groups
=
damn those vocal, you're lying to yourself if you don't stan Mamamoo's talent...they're more likely to have fun rather than a competition, love their interaction with audience
=
I LOVE MAMAMOO, OUR QUEENDOM
=
I LOVE MAMAMOO, OUR QUEENDOM
=
Yeah, they're absolutely the next queen
=
Mamamoo's stage presence is everything. Also take away from this video that they were not at 100%, went first out of an impressive line-up, yet still managed to receive second place shows just how powerful their stage presence and performance skills are.
=
Who was the guy in the intro?
=
They only had ONE day to prepare this stage
=
yuqi is so relatable im crying
=
Sinceramente estas chicas tienen talento de sobra 
=
Mamamoo!! The real queen
=
I get goosebumps
=
Lets reach 4M
=
Power, charisma, like a BOSS 
=
Goosebumps all over 
=
Yuqi is LITERALLY MEEEEE
=
Yuqi's commentary lmao same gurl
=
why are guys in the audience good looking lmao
=
Hwasa is my bias... The rest are my bias wreckers.
=
0:39 is me
=
I LOVE YOU SIHUN!!!! Waiting for your debuting!!!!!!!
=
Best live stage in  3rd generation of kpop girl group
=
0:39  are those Brand New Music trainees?
=
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.... That's all I got since I don't have words anymore. I Stan over and over again
=
Queens being queens
=

=
They are my winners
=

=
WOW QUEENs
=
Sexy at its finest with minimal skin exposure. 
My Queens 
=

This is true talent!!! Natural talent!!!
=
OOIRAAAAAA YAAAHH
=
DONAS DO KPOP MEU DEUS DO CÉU EU AMO ESSAS MULHERESSSSSSSSSSSSS
=
QUEENS!!!!
=
Power vocals in the house. No need fancy complicated choreography.
=
mamamoo gave everything here,they were dead tired after they were just done with their 4seasons4colors concert in Daegu and then going back to Seoul to record for queendom the next day..workaholics mmm and they even invited park bom to sit with them together.. so much respect to this humble group..they just messed up the nametags for trolling please international fans noticed this talented ladies
=
Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.
=
Talent. True artist. I just always love them. Who can't? Hwasa stop being cool. 
=
IS it only me who saw BNW boys????
And by the way what are they doing there? Lmao
=
Soyeon ON STAGE - Fierce, Sexy, Bad Attitude Vibes, Fiesty
Soyeon OFF Stage - Cute, Smiley, A Fan
Hahahahaha love Soyeon
=
Sorry for late watching 
=
No one can defeat my loves
=
The harmony at the 4:30 is just pure GOLD.
=
mamamoo get all the girls
=
I watch this so many times!!OMG Love Mamamoo❤!!
=
Dear my lovely Mamamoo ,,
My handsome girl Moonbyul,
My sexy girl Hwasa,
My cute Solar, and
My Charismatic Whein.
I hope always be healthy, always be happy, and be strong Please take care my love love 
=
God. I've been sleeping on these fabulous ladies.
=
The vocals
=
An amazing performance by MAMAMOO. This is a good song. I don't stan them, but I recognize them as being the most vocally talented group in K-Pop. Even though I don't go as far as calling myself a fan, I have a habit of watching all of their music show performances, and I bought their last four title tracks on iTunes. They are fun to watch.
=
Mamamoo was the field show necessary lol
=
Am I the only one who noticed that the flags have their initials on them during 3:39?
=
They are prove that u don't need sexy outfits to be amazing
=
REAL ARTISTS!!!!!!!!!!
=
=
What I like about Mamamoo is that every individual give their individual aura unlike other groups where  one or other member always gets underrated ĺ
=
Staff : what do you want to eat for breakfast 
Mamamoo : CD 
Okay I'm fan of mamamoo rn
=
and they recorded this right after two days of concerts
THESE GIRLS ARE AMAZING
=
Why all of them bring their legendary song
I can't hold myself TT
=
Now if only the camera captured moonbyul perfectly when she came in at the beginning 
That was such a cool moment too!
=
It’s just my dream see them perform thin os Billboard
=
Always be The Majesty of My fav List .
=
Wheein so prettyyyy
=
FOR REAL, MAMAMOO HAS THE BEST SHOW.
=
Go go go mamamoo...you girls own the stage..
=
LOVE MAMAMOO U R the CHAMPION IN MY HEART !!!!!!!!

BTW, the girl on 1:07 was so pretty! like jisoo blackpink kekekeke
=
mamamoo is on a different level compared to other groups ... who prioritize more vocal performances as well as dances ... and nothing can get away from it ... they have different charms ... that's why I love them so much
=
Mamamoo is my religion 
=
I saw the drums at the beginning, I just miss afterschool 
=
I got goosebumps. That just proved how good mamamoo is
=
I see sihoon❣️
=
I love girls hyping up other girls
=
Moonbyul❤!!!!
=
Hyejin, i love you!
=
LOVE MAMAMOO ❣️



also love the produce x 101 trainees reaction
=
Reinas!♥ Las amo♥
=
Like any other groups there
The Most badass member on stage turns out to be the softest back stage
*lookin at you soyeon*
=
,
=
再一次愛上mamamoo~~
=
This reaction doesn’t resemble upper/lower vote at all, how come mamamoo got zero on both is still a mystery in radish universe 
=
idk why but it's hard to find mmm's performance like I have to search every word while the ones from AOA and G IDLE are on my youtube  board whenever I watch something related to Queendom 
Im a Moomoo btw
=
=
Wauuuuuuwww 
=
Their stage presence is sooo unreal they're not even trying, they just look like they're partying it's so freaking natural yet the power omg
Step on me Hwasa
You make me gheiii Moonbyul and Solar
Wheein goshhh
=
Yuqi: YES! I WILL! 
STAN MAMAMOO 
=
vocal no kaleng 2 
=
They made such a great intro. Everyone was afraid to go first but not mamamoo. I really love their confidence.
=
GOOOOOOSEBUMPS OMGGGGSKKSKS I LOVE THEM!!!! ALSO GIDLE REACTING TO THEM IS A BLESSING
=
A stage that shocked me 
=
I'm digging this militaristic look.
=
Why are they so cool?
=
Mamamoo always has the best scene. They are awesome
=
Did they ranked #1? Cos ive watched the other perfs and theirs are the most entertaining. They can just sing and dance without effects and still be slaying. Such a great performer!!!!
=
its baek jin time.. i saw a few trainee from produce x 101 in audience... brand new music trainees also there..
=
Mamamoooooo!!!!!
=
the audience look handsome too :((((
=
1:07 Ryu Hanbi ?
=
Mamamoo~ 
Moomoo fans are so proud of you guys
BIG THUMBS UP
=
=
Awesome performance! Now I can't wait for next episode where mamamoo will cover AOA song ... its gonna be like "Immortal Song" all over again with mamamoo!! 
=
(g)i-dle is the true definition of mamammo's fangirl 
=
A real Queen doesn't need a sexy outfit to look sexy .. Go MamaMoo
=
Group that performce with less dance and simple dance moves gives more swag 
=
Im afraid of mmm next stage. They gonna cover Aoa good luck, n im just watching that song just now. There a lots sexy dance what if im really die for real after watching their performance
=
They are not come to play 
They even come straight from 4 hours concert for two days but the quality
PERIOD
=
Still pissed they didn't win
=
I'm not a fan but I liked that they didn't show any skin yet they still looked sexy and powerful
=
I am actually have expression like jisoo at 2:09. Mamamoo really slay it
=
Mamamoo never fails to impress us like this performance is a whole concert worth
=
1:07 I'm this girl, trying to be discreet as I hide my heterosexuality inexistence 
=
this should become a *NATIONAL ANTHEM* dahling!
=
SUPERIOR QUEENS
=
(G) Idle super fans de MAMAMOO Ame los comentarios de g idle y las reaciones
=
OMG ARE SUCH FANGIRLS SO CUTE
=
Their performance was awesome and they didn't even needed to do a dance break, and a really though choreography because their stage presence and vocals did everything
=
pls tell me im not the only one who saw brandnew were here!!! i saw sihun guys
=
VOCAL QUEENS!!!
=
MAMAMOO's performance is so engaging. Its like you were drawn into the stage to watch them till the end and scream when you feel like it.
=
They weren't able to prepare much, yet they're performance was so captivating that they got 2nd place despite performing first. Mamamoo are seriously queens
=
i love how mamamoo doesnt use nosy/annoying mr
they can 100% sing their whole song in all notes live. and this makes them so special♥
=
Who say MAMAMOO is not worth to stan? Look at them...they are so talented. <3
=
I mean it doesn't seem that they're in a competition, it's like they're having their own concert right there. MY FOREVER QUEENSSSS MAMAMOOO ❤❤❤❤
=
Watching this everyday for a good mood 
=
How people don’t stan them is beyond me— look at this talent
=
I’m coming for mamamoo
=
MAMAMOO got a lot of reaction from other groups
=
This reminds me a lot of Beyonces homecoming opening 
=
What an amazing performance! I felt the impact! I love Mamamoo so much!
=
2:27 - that peace sign from moonbyul was adorable wtf.
=
Here is the diference between giddle and mamamoo. The secondone sang all the song by theirself  the reazon why they are queens 
=
Wheein ❤️
=
I really feel GOOD !!!
=
Welcome to the MAMAMOO's concert.
=
THEY'RE AMAZING!!!  THE BEST GIRL GROUP IN KPOP AND IN THE WORLD !!! 
=
The best intro!
=
So this is how you become gay for a few minutes
=
By performing first they set the bar for others
And I can tell it was goddamn *H I G H*
=
0:46 same girl..same
So cool!! 
=
People dislike this video omgg, seriously whyyy
=
They Sing LIVE ! 
=
Seunghee reaction is me
=
QUEENS 
=
I love how they can always change up the stage 
=
Mamamoo slay this stage right after finished 4 hours concert at Busan..  bow to uri Queen ‍♀️
=
THOSE VOCALS Y’ALL
=
I feeeeel good. 
=
Omg i just love them!
=

=
行走的CD！超好聽！Perfect！
=
Gue speechlese anjirrr.... Mereka abis makan kaset sebelum manggung kah? WOY ITU SUARA NGAPA GAK FALS SAMA SEKALI HEEEEEHHHH 
=
Yeaaaa! Slayinnnnn'
=
STREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
=
Yooa we understand so much baby
=
好帥啊
=
Soyeon is so cute at 3:21
Mamamoo is so excellent !! 
They just over the concert, and then join the competition. 
Hope they always be healthy ~~~
Don't get sick!!
=
To think that they are not in their best condition yet they gave a very wholesome, powerful, superb, amazing performance. Damn girls! That's why i love them. They're MY QUEENS 
=
No matter how many times I watch this I’m still in awe with this performance ❤️ *goosebumps*
=
Watching this vid everyday is such a blessing
=
*STEP ON ME MAMAMOO*
=
Homecoming?
=
i love them but is no one gon talk abt how sihoon is there
=
After School should join this program
=
1:07
=
Momo let's make it to 4m views!!!
=
Decalcomanie dance ver. 
https://youtu.be/o0I8YjeWfQU
=
Consider and being nice with other team, willing to take a 1st spot performance. Set a high standard for others to beat and got a a 2nd place overall. Imagine if this performance last or 2nd last to go. Mamamoo will swept everything. Sorry for my bad english.
=
I love Mamamoo because they listen to each other so well. No one overpowers the other and they match each other tones really well. 
It’s also nice not to hear high pitched tones either. I love other girl groups but sometimes I got to take a break when the girls are made to sing in a high pitched tone.
=
Let's gain more (girl)fans, our mamamoo!!!
=
Not trying to compare because everyone have their own charm but LOVE how mamamoo didn't even add extra element throughout their song except the intro and still excel only based on their amazing stage presence and talent! Stan mamamoo for a better life!
=
Their stage presence as a whole is out of this world but Hwasa is a literal god when performing. She was born to be on stage. 
Even when its not her part the charisma is just overflowing.
=
MooMoo let's str3am and support our girls, they deserve it .
=
2:11 during moonbyul’s rap you can hear wheein’s honey vocals and awesome runs. youre welcome
=
Solar was smiling the whole time....the fact that she fell asleep in her seat.... MAMAMOO was just having fun... their main goal is to perform a perfect stage to their fans... they took advantage this show to do what they want.... soooo down to earth girl group
=
To think I thought 2NE1 is the last girl group to have this kind of stage presence 
=
Out of topic, THOSE BOYS ARE SO HANDSOME!
=
Mamamoo is coming
=
Mamamoo is coming
=
Doesn't need sexy outfit when they have sexy aura..
=
To all Moomoos that participate in fanwars : 
Do you even remember how much our Queens themselves hate fan wars and encourage us to love and respect to other groups?? Where is that respect now??
 Please, if you ever came across a hateful comment, just report them... Do not attach the fandom with being too active in fan wars... Others like to hate on Mamamoo for even participating in QueenDom but for me, the reason they wanna enter is to entertain us fans and also to perform on stage which they truly love most..
SPREAD LOVE ❤❤ NOT HATE , .
=
รายการนี้ปะ ที่โดนดราม่าแบ่งห้องพักลำเอียง
=
They’re the best and there’s no way you can deny this fact. QUEENS.
=
SO MANY CUTE GUYS !!! The girls and them TOO MANY BEAUTY IN ONE VIDEO !!!

=
i really don't care about those competition again tho.i'm in love with mamamoo now , hahahaha. for me , those competition is useless , hahahaha. all who join the competition of queendom is the best tho. i just don't know why there is no gfriend. if there is gfriend , it will be more interesting.
=
C’mon people. Ya’ll need to stop sleeping on these queens
=
Literally the only group that ever has their mics up loud enough so you can HEAR them singing. Their voices are freaking amazing and always perfect. They deserve so much more popularity
=

=

=
KOREA IS SO BLESSED TO HAVE THEM. HWASA BLESS US WITH THAT GRACE
=
Omg can someone explain me why I saw Junghwan and Sihoon among the audience???
=
i keep on watching this tho. so effortless but lit
=
I never gave MAMAMOO a chance and I now regret it! This song is so fire! Their stage precense is 2NE1 level and they are amazing vocalists! Just found a new gg to stan for sure!
=
mamamoo reminds of the swag that 2ne1 always had during their performances. fighting bom and mamamoo!
=
HOW TO BREATH???? MAMAMOO SLAYS!
=
They always turn any stage into their own concert, as expected of the performance queens
=
MAMAMOO TAKE MY ENERGY!! ٩(๑❛ᴗ❛๑)۶
=
In my opinion mamamoo is the best female grouptheir voice is just amazing and sooo strong
=
This is competition? Nope, this is just mamamoo want to increase their 4% male moomoo population .... 
=
I just died watching this there was so much attack especially Moonbyul's rap since her rap in Décalcomanie is one of my favorites.
=
=
MAMAMOO is REALLY COMING BACK FOR YOU ALL!!!
=
Simplemente Diosas 
=
Love u
=
The rearrangement of this song made it even better. And of course my girls. And wheeins ruining my member preference now 
=
When solar slipped even her sound of being terrified is a melody
=
Seriously the best vocal group out there.   Was shocked to read Solar was turned down by 40 companies.  You gotta keep believing for the right team at the right time
=
Solar is profesional the way she handled herself when she made a slight mistake was great
=
I'm just saying this performance is concert worthy but Mamamoo gave it to y'all for free in this competition. Seriously this is some MTV awards worthy performance or something.
=
can we also appreciate moonbyul's brilliance of writing a new verse? 
everyone's flags were in their respective 4 season colors too!!
=
Solar: “I’m im the top”
Moonbyul: *say no more-*
=
Jimin was shook when Solar started singing Puss, and so was I
=
their stage presence is just out of this universe
=
Haters: “MAMAMOO did a horrible cover of AOA God Luck”
AOA:  “dying in fangirls mod”
=
I just noticed whenever the cam goes to Bom, she was staring at the group, all of the group to be exact, which u can sense sadness. How she miss her group

Bom: we used to be like them. We used to be the ones who rule this Kpop world. We used to be the queens, now we rule our own kingdom. It is still better when we are together
=
The only reason mamamoo hasn't done this kind of concept more often is because they don't want everyone to die prematurely
=
Girls be gay and dropping panties after watching mamamoo
=
Is everyone ok? My cause of death was moonbyul. Let's all enjoy the afterlife together
=
Wheein getting more sexy and hot wow
=
Solar: girls girls on top
Eric Nam: has entered the chat
=
Look, I'm not saying moonsun could get married here based on their outfits...but I wouldn't be surprised if it suddenly turned into a wedding
=
Can we just appreciate wheein's outfit? She ROCKS
=
i watched this for about more than 100 times but i didn’t know that solar tripped at 3:39 like... PROFESSIONAL!!!!
=
*WHO IS DOING IT LIKE MAMAMOO?* NOBODY. I ONLY SEE GODDESSES
=
can we appreciate how professional Solar is even if she slipped.
=
MAMAMOO IS ONE OF THE MOST ALL ROUNDER KPOP GROUPS OUT THERE THAT'S ACTUALLY STABLE AND GOOD. THAT'S A FACT AND YOU CAN'T DISAGREE
=
This is why everyone should be stanning Mamamoo.
=
Bruh all I gotta say is 




YASSSSSS QUEENS 
=
I don't even care who wins the damn thing. Seeing all of them cover each other's songs is enough for me to die in happiness.
=
AT 3:04 I SCRIMMED WHEEIN YOU DIDN’T HAVE TO ATTacK LIKE THAT
=
Mamamoo literally is the only group out there being criticised for showcasing too much talent in a single performance.  #RaiseYourStandards 
=
LITERALLY MAMAMOO JUST GAVE THE REAL PURPOSE OF QUEENDOM.
=
no one does it like mamamoo. they deadass made a whole new concept out of aoa's good luck. queens stop slaying me like this pls
=
All I wanna to say is
They are literally a *QUEEN*
=
dont let loco see this masterpiece!!! he might marry hwasa after watching
=
4:28 is my favorite part because of their expressions. This is the reason why I dig Mamamoo's live performance. They totally enjoyed it and it makes me, as viewers, happy :D
=
wheein is my literal aesthetic she literally is goals✨
=
Bitch this is not just a performance, this a whole level concert
=
that was so disrespectful. Hwasa with her hips hitting the floor, Moonbyul with her handsomeness, Solar with her legs, Wheein and her little red dress. Gave me a heart attack out here 
=
When someone says nothing is perfect
Me: *shows em this vid*
=
I really liked the genre they went for for Hwasa’s part. The overall performance tho was really great. All of them did so well. Moonbyul shook me when she came in w her own rap it kinda murdered me ngl
=
This is why more than 90% mamamoo fans is girl..i mean non-straight girls
=
I like died a hundred times bc of this. TALENTED WOMEN
=
MAMAMOO IS YHAT QUALITY GIRL GROUP THAT NEED MORE ATTENTION AND WE ALL SHOULD APPRECIATE THEIR TALENT
=
This is how many INTERNATIONAL fans mamamoo have

⬇️
=
Who am i kidding ofcourse imma hit that replay button damn
=
Wheein kinda murdered me
I lied they all killed me I was just tryna blame one person for my death
=
Hwasa was born to be on the stage. the power she has, the aura she exudes, the emotions she express. Her stage presence is unbelievable.
=
The girl’s reaction just exactly like when I heard Moon rap
=
Oh my gosh wheein's new hairstyle is going to kill mehhhhhhhh
=
Hwasa is INCREDIBLE. Her stage presence is completely UNTOUCHABLE.
=
this really feels like a concert, how they can make the audience to follow them. the power
=
The amount of screams for byul tho.... HARD SAME
=
True Confidence Here. 
*Who else bow with me?*
=
FIERCE HWASA
BADASS MOONBYUL
GORGEOUS SOLAR
SEXY WHEEIN
TALENTED MAMAMOO 
=
Honestly, every time I watch this
I never notice Solar trip
She makes it unnoticeable
Also at 4:09 she looks so offended that the lyrics was taken
=
THEY'RE QUEENS I'M NOT EVEN COMPLAINING. PERIOF
=
" Who is the next?" I'M DEAD
=
They just represented 4 types of different girl power from this performance: 
Hwasa - bad bitch
Moonbyul - tomboyish
Solar - sultry diva
Wheein - sexy
=
THEY'RE HAVING A COMEBACK SOON, SUPPORT THE QUEENS!
=
So all of Mamamoo literally just said that they're tops. cool. imma just die then
=
I REMEMBER IMPRETTY RAPSTAR BC OF THAT PUSS XD
=
whenever I watch MAMAMOO’s performance, it is like they can share power
I feel like I CAN DO EVERYTHING
=
I'm sorry but I can't find any girl group in this generation that can top mamamoo's stage presence
=
Am I the only one laughing while Wheein SPRINTS over to the main stage lollll
=
Mamamoo is always consistently on top, but can we get a round with just vocals (acapella or acoustic songs) and watch them (& Park Bom) annihilate everyone?
=
I swear wheein is a goddess
=
Solar: Girls girls on top
Also Solar: **BOOP**
=
Mnet Queendom : you can doing lipsync if you want
Mamamoo : are you drunk?
=
Honestly speaking, if the people voting aint trainees or fans, mamamoo would win with their stage presence for this round.
=
This group called Mamamoo is sooooooooooo good omg
=
I feel I'm watching a medley stage of 4 new songs 
MAMAMOO's concert is worth everyone attending 
=
"It's like a concert"
I TOTALLY AGREE
Moomoo for life 
Proud of my girls
=
Anti's said that they lipsync lol hwasa should've not sang the lyrics wrong, if it's recorded. Gosh, just accept that they are queens.
=
I’ve been watching this over and over again for months. Their performance is really captivating 
=
If you think that this is a mess, pls watch the performance without the reactions. 
The constant interruptions mnet did (around a min Only for mamamoo - for the rest it was shorter) are making it sound like a mess.
I swear it's not! Just hear the full audio.
=
I heard this when i played spotify and i was like, wait a minute i'm playing mamamoo's song right ? But why AOA song played. Then i check in youtube and seeing this and OMG it's mind blowing it's like masterpiece, i mean it's great, such a best perform from Mamamoo 
I luv it 
=
Mamamoo the best performances in queendom
=
Really felt like it was a stage from their concert  if you didn’t tell me it was a cover song
=
Can we just take time to appreciate hwasa's floor twerk like it's the most perfect thing I've seen this week
=
Mamamoo is not a girl group. Not woman group nor Queen group. They have transcended the heavens and become the *GODDESS* group.
=
To the girl in 1:21
Yes i feel the same
=
Watch 1:51 and 4:10 , mnet is a snake, this is why I prefer watch the performance without the reactions
=
The facr Jimin made when Solar sing Puss it's so funny "good she's good "
=
My god, why can’t America have queens like these 4  would sell my kidneys to see them live.
=
notice how jimin’s(AoA) reaction to the end of MoonByul’s verse and her reaction to Solar singling her song is the same
(queendom pulled a fast one)
=
If you still dont stan mamamoo at this point, you need to reevaluate your standards when it comes to super women group
=
I got Goosebumps  hear the high notes of solar
=
Im rooting for them to win it all!!! No one can do live performances back to back to back lik them with RAW vocals!!!!
=
Remember when stans from other groups said this iconic and original performance was a mess? Mamamoo got a FULL SCORE from the audience. We had to laugh. Mookarma is real ladies
=
Back to Queendom stage looks so much better than MAMA 2019 so far 
=
wheein is hot and no one can fight me on this 
Lotta love for mamamoo 
=
omg wheein was so beautiful and her voice too ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
My heart broke every time they showed Park Bom because you can see in her expressions how much she misses being on a group in this case 2NE1 ...
=
This is literally biggest hit towards anyone who has said that Mamamoo cannot perform well whilst dancing and that they're only stable because they don't do much dancing. Like this performance is both a win for the straights and gays. What can Mamamoo not do? And that Unpretty Rapstar reference, damn Solar.
=
4:29
Hwasa singing that bridge sounded amazing
=
why is Jimin's Reaction same with 1:50 and 4:09 Mnet's editing again?
=
Me gusta más esta versión que la original :v
Like si a ti también;-;
=
4:39 the mean of power 
=
Love how each part showed their style and who they were
=
So this is what gogobebe did to them btw their stage presence was so good I’m jungshook
=
Im official BISEXUAL and mamamoo shape me into something real
=
I honestly don't know how many times I've watched this perf. So awesome. Byul killed me and my ovaries
=
And i think this is why the lesbian rate is going up
=
Jimin’s reaction when Solar started rapping with the lyrics from “Puss” lmao
=
I love every Jimin's reaction for this performance lol
=
What an outstanding performance. That was indeed a mini concert.
=
HWASA IS SUCH A QUEEN I LOVE HER CONFIDENCE HER STAGE PRESENCE. CAN’T TAKE MY EYES OFF HER EVERY MOMENT.
=
Why so handsome my Byulie.❤
=
mamamoo : *you're welcome*
=
Solar: ...chill
Me: I can't 
=
technically there is 5 different genres performed: 
hwasa - reggae
moonbyul - hiphop
solar - big band/jazz
wheein - r&b/pop 
finally when they perform as OT4, it's rock. 
(that baseline during the bridge though) 
so proud of these ladies. 
MAMAMOO HWAITING
=
文总好帅！！！！！发出我可以的声音
=
As an AoA Elvis I have to say this performance was really great. Mamamoo did an excellent job with this song. Is it just me or does Hwasa resemble the Gerudo girls in the Zelda games.
=
This is my first time seeing mamamoo... Imagine the shock I got from watching these ladies perform and kill it on stage o_O
=
This is not a competition, this is MAMAMOO's concert
=
"Mother father top madam"
=
They don't have one specific concept. Each one give to the group their other own concept and create something amazing named MAMAMOO
=
4:07
When someone brings up an embarrassing situation of yours at an important party.
P.S.: Jimin's face
=
Hwasa was born to be a star. Her stage presence and confidence always impresses me.
=
Wheein is so gorgeous in this hairstyle, i can't!!!
=
Look at their confidence and sucess makes me feel so good since i am just a potato
=
OMG WHEEIN...
=
Did anyone realise that the clip of Jimin at 1:51 is the same as 4:10 LOL nice mnet
=
I'm not joking when I say whenever I watch this performance I choked a lot. It's hard to breathe like ffff.
=
2:09 somewhere in the world Hyuna is very proud
=
Why they edited jimins shocking face reaction from moonbyul on solars rap verse???
=
Hwasa is sexy you know we know she knows Jimin knows, Loco knows, Baehyun knows and Taehyung knows...
=
People and the other idols were screaming hard while Mamamoo was performing this song. Every idol was scared and accepted the fact that they can't beat Mamamoo. Lemme tell ya, "This wasn't even Mamamoo's best performance, you'd have dies on the spot if u saw the best."
Edit- No hate intended to the others, take this as a joke plz.
=
THE FREAKING CHARISMA YOU ALL....
=
This just made me love them
=
*who else almost died watching them do this?* 
mamamoo is 100000/10 in talent— please Stan :< 
=
Who says mamamoo have it easy cause they don't dance? They can do it all, find another excuse for your faves
=
Seriously this feels like watching a concert
=
BOM is missing her members 
=
Everyone's talented and amazing in their own performances! I can't decide who's the best, but I love them all BOM, G-IDLE, Mamamoo, AOA
=
THIS COVER ITS SO AMAZING
=
Lol they are so bad at lipsync that they sing live instead
=
I CANT GET THIS OUT OF MY HEAD HELP
=
this is my i can't count watch 
=
4:47 
Don’t flip flop mind me
=
Let's clap our hands for wheein too :))
=
Mnet: you don't have to sing live
Mamamoo: hold my mic and apologize to it
=
Wheein, Solar, Moonbyul, and Hwasa tho 
=
Mamamoo is one of the most complete groups this world has ever seen
=
4:26 "its like a concert" yes girl. we feel you.
=
I watch this on a daily basis.
=
When solar almost slipped but still sang better than almost all singers ahahaha 3:31
=
Wheein’s so COOL
=
The energy!! The renditions!! The added verses!! 
=
Moonbyul’s fan girls when she came out ❤️
=
They just put like 5 genres/concepts into one song...wow queens
=
Idk why this performance getting hate?when i first watched the episode this was literally the performance that gave me goosebumps
=
watching this makes you STAN MAMAMOO more
=
They killed it!! The best vocal group EVER!! This is why you mustn’t sleep on Mamamoo!!! Sleep on your pillows instead!!
=
Okay, now this is a performance! It’s called QUEENDOM for a reason! 
=
I’m waiting for their comeback and their legengary performance at MAMA . Who’s with me ?
=
The performance full of surprise! 
=
This deserves the first place
=
To those so called "dancers who can also sing" who are coming after mamamoo saying their dance is easy Please post of video of yourself Dancing and SINGING IN THE SAME LEVEL AS THEY DID.
P.s. Tbh I am a dancer who can also sing too.In my opinion the dance here is an average dance routine for kpop girls group and it's definitely not an easy dance routine.Plus most of kpop girl group who also have average dance routine like this one haven't gave us the same POWERFUL AND STABLE VOCALS LIKE MAMAMOO SO STOP complaining AND ENJOY THE MINI CONCERT THEY JUST GAVE YOU ALL FOR FREEE.
=
Please they just group of playful kids when choosing the song but this is the result. It's illegal im calling the police!
=
People who throw hates on this performance simply because they don’t want to admit that our Queens SLAYED ‘EM THIS HARD 
=
The way Solar just kept on singing and dancing like nothing happened after she almost feel shows how professional she is
=
THEY CAME
THEY SAW
THEY CONQUERED
=
Hwasa: sassy, swag
Moonbyul: boyish swag making everyone gay
Solar: flirty, burlesque
Wheein: chic, dancing queen
WE LOVE OUR 4 QUEENS!!
Edit: thank you guys for the likes ❤️
Edit n.2: 1k likes? ❤️
=
Wheein so pretty
=
best girl group in kpop industry.
sorry not sorry. they got number one for me:') so talented. like little mix..
=
Wheein looks so good OMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!
=
Its a good decision that Hwasa is the first performer. So fierce!
=
Mamamoo really owned this stage
=
I know this sounds weird but, at the end I love how hwasa and the backup dancers were actually twerking and not back popping
=
Haters: they lipsyncing 

Mamamoo: what’s that 
=
*Who told them to prepare for a concert?? They're supposed to cover a song. THEIR PERFORMANCE AND STAGE PRESENCE IS EVERYTHING!!!*
=
YAZZZZ!  The stage is burning
=
WHEEIN ON A PIANOOOOO
=
0:12 oh no Jimim doesn't look like that. What have you done to Jimin. 
=
4 singers, 4 rappers, 4 dancers, 4 individuals, together they are MAMAMOO!!! So proud of them! 
=
Moonbyul is my bias but WHEEIN is so freakin gorgeous with that red outfit 
=
4:08 jimin 
=
Woooow they’re so good I’m in love with them ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
OMG HOW CAN SOMEBODY DEVOUR THE STAGE LIKE THIS
=
I really don’t want to be overly dramatic but Mamamoo is the personification of perfection.
=
Park bom reaction 4:58 
=
1:51 and 4:10 are literally the same frame.
=
Wheein looks so good in here! So pretty! 
=
President of S. Korea: When do you want to meet
Hwasa: Yes
=
The besssst after Park Bom in Queendom 
=
I wish I was blessed enough to see that live.
=
Lmao, hwasa was singing the chorus like Girigiri I like me..... I always sing it wrong too, lmao, im not the only one
=
What the?? This level of performance is like an award show. They really are not playing..
=
this group is on another level
=
I'm literally screeching right now
=
I watch almost every hour and i never bored. But because that i almost forget the original song
=
I want hwasa's version to cover the full song 
=
I knew I could trust Wheein
=
wheein step on me PERIODT
=
I just thought that what if mamamoo covered 2ne1 song? That's gonna be cool moonbyul being CL omooo~
=
After a long time I am seeing some strong vocals and damn that concept . It reminds me of the  hardcore concepts and songs of 2ne1 . This group definitely made bom feel !
=
4:39 I love this part. When the four of them sing
=
bom's look after solar's high note: rip my career
=
What happened to Solar shows that Mamamoo is not doing lip-synch in any performances. The Queens.❤️
=
I can’t breathe ma Queen
=
Hwasa's stage presence is on another level. She has that Queen aura.
=
Solar rapping is another level..!!
=
Are we gonna ignore the fact that Hwasa just gave the floor some love (if you know what I mean )
=
Hwasa ❤️
=
Solar rap Puss is the best 
=
Theyre trully LEGENDS ! MAMAMOO
=
They slay as always~~
=
4:59
Parkbom: i Miss my group.. 
=
I've watched this for an unhealthy amount... :')
=
so, queendom is actually just a platform for mamamoo's flexing...
honestly as much as I am a loyal miracle and lovelinus, mamamoo clearly and fairly deserves to win this show, right from the start. no one is at their level of performance.
=
Oh! Solar so beautiful. I like her shape so much.Its inspire for me.I want body like herrrr❤❤❤
=
@4:54 my reaction this whole video lol
=
Wheein.... You stole my heart
=
5:00 you can clearly see that bom is missing 2ne1 days when they were performing together
=
Hwasa's stage presence is really out of this world. She is so amazing.
=
They make every second count. AWESOME 
=
1:21.. hunny, I feel you.
=
Mamamoo queendom marathon because comeback is near ❤️❤️
=
The high notes gave me goosebumps
=
First time in recorded history a group on television steals another groups song and makes it their own with little resistance
=
1:21 *Literally me having a heart attack*
=
Mamamoo makes me wanna buy harness
=
you know you're on top when Bom starts looking nervous
=
KIM YONG SUN!
MOON BYULYI!
JUNG WHEE IN!
ANH HYEJIN!
MAMAMOO!!!!!
=
STRAIGHT UP SLAPS ‼️‼️
=
byul still catches me off guard here,, like look at her suddenly appearing like THAT mom im gay
=
Moonbyul​ Oppa
=
I bet they all were born on stage, let's ask their moms 
=
I want a suga and moonybul collab 
=
Mamamoo are so powerful QUEENS
=
I’m drooling tbh  MY QUEENS!!!!!
=
Need video for this songs, MAMAMOOOOOOOO LEGENDS
=
*MAMAMOO IS DEFINITELY IS ALREADY ON ANOTHER LEVEL OF KPOP THAT YOU WILL NEVER EVER WILL FOUND THE SAME ONE LIKE THIS*
=
Wow they went all out it really feels like concert!!!!
=
1:01, yo solo vi como la chica de la derecha quería opacar a GodHwasa
=
wow mamamoo got some serious swag damn..
=
There’s no song that they can’t sing! They own the stage! ❤️
=
Hwasa slayed.
Solar slayed.
Wheein slayed.
Moonbyul slayed.
We Moomoos found slayed.
=
WOW AMAZING <3
=
Their voices really blended well my gosh this is so amazing group
=
*They sing this song like their own* *QUEENS*
=
OMG the song already my favorite... n when this come... OMG!!! OMG!!! OMG!!! Im so hyper!!!... urghhhh i need to calmed down... fuh~~ fuh~~~~ my love part is ALL!!!
=
Damn moonbyul's growls always get meee
=
I love how even when solar slipped, she still keep her expression normal and professional. That's what i call a true talented artist
=
*her reaction is my reaction* 1:21
=
She's right this is like their CONCERT!! 
=
What I just saw are four ladies with souls that are independent, strong and sparkling. What is more, they are a team. Just superb.
=
So amazing perfomance stage
Mamamoo fighting
=
I love it stage so very perfect
=
Hwein and moonbyul so beautiful in here
=
4:41 I'm gay for Wheein
=
My ears so blessing
=
Can we talk about 4.57 Minnie said “Wow” in very Thai accent ?
=
Me: *watched this the minute it was uploaded about 5362727 times*
YouTube recommendation: *constantly recommend me this ever since*
I'm not complaining though.
=
i truly love their dancers
=
2.09 my fav <3
=
that little slip up and recovery shows off mamamoo's professionalism AND the fact that they're singing 100% live

edit: ok!! what i meant was that they're giving their 100% !!! i can hear the backing track stop coming for me and stream this thanks
=
Tbh I was so enchanted by them that i only noticed that Solar made a mistake by reading a comment otherwise that would've gone completly over my head ‍♀️
=
This is everything 
=
Look at the girls' reaction when Byul appears . 
=
Mamamoo are QUEENS, but its absolutely embarrassing as a moomoo to see some fellow "fans" of Mamamoo drag other groups in the comments.
Have you learned nothing from watching our girls? They're literally some of the most humble people in the industry. Stop being a  and shitting on other groups to raise our own.
*THANKS* 
*Edit:* Guys, before you reply with "I don't see any comments like that". Top comments on videos get switched around. There was a specific one with 327 likes that was the main reason for me posting this. If there is no toxic shit in the comments like that right now then that's great. Just clarifying why I said this in the first place.. We can hype our queens without putting down others in the process.
=
MOONBYUL AND HER GENTLEMEN <3
=
The reaction at 1:51 tho
=
so much talent. these girls are true performers!!! LOVE mamamoo!!!
=
woAH HIP mv played before this
=
this song is stuck in my head bcz of mamamoo cover lol
=
Apparently JIMIN said she wanted to get closer to SOLAR. 
For now they had successfully exchange phone numbers,
Next, we wait for puss vol2.
=
Didn't expect this sexy concept from Wheein. ❤
=
We need more Mamamoo performing songs from other group (but they may make all look like theirs though)
=
wheein is so BEAUTYFULLLLL!!!!
=
that girls girls on top. . my eyes almost popped out byulie is blessed. . nvr let go of solar. . #moonsun
=
thankyou mamamoo, im blessed :')
=
MAMAMOO DID IT YA'LL
=
Amazing performance n amazing voice
=
These girls are sick!!! Omg!!! 
=
4:09 Jimin looks betrayed hahaha
=
I forgot how to breathe
=
Omo Jimin's analytical reaction on their raps, we stan an observant queen
=
3:27 yOOO I FEEL SO ATTACKED?!?
=
Must say... Solars back up dancers body made me feel self conscious of my own.
=
Moonbyul pls girl kill me with your devastating wink attack
=
I'm laughing too hard at that girl having a gay panic for Moonbyul when she came
=
❤️love ma ma m o o
=
I. AM. STRAI—wait, am I?
=
I just want to be the piano
=
seriously jinnja, mamamoo should got more recognize. they are so talented:') dont sleep over their talent please
=
Mamamoo indeed! 
=
Just like their concert. OMG !!!
=
Lots of kinds of music in this video OMG
=
I don't know what this show is, but they need to win it
=
Seriously, if they don’t win this, I will flip tables.
=
And I'm supposed to believe Hwasa is the maknae
=
Mamamoo is sooooo WONDERFUL ❤
=
Tbh, i dont really like this performance at start. But from the second reff and on its really good
=
im a proud fans ♥
=
I actually like solar concept more
=
solar just prove us its not lips sync. 
=
Gosh. This is not simply a cover.... this is a CONCERT! As expected of MMM!!! FIGHTING! ❤
=
I couldn’t even count how many times I’ve watched this vid tbh
=
okay everyone, you gotta be prepared for their comeback, you hear me?? that’s our fight for them
=
HWASA DROPPING IT IN FRONT OF ALL OF OUR SALADS
=
_I'm just a simple person, I see MAMAMOO I_*cLiCk_*
=
PUSS???!! 
OH MY GOD!
=
solar rapping is life
=
I DIED❤❤
=
I like how every member has their time to show their style
=
They freaking slayed the stage...  BOOYAH!!
=
mamamoo and gidle own this show
=
that ending tho
=
*THE P O W E R*
=
hwasa makes my jaw drop every time i watch her on the stage, she's honestly amazing
=
2:09 hyuna? :D
=
THEY ARE SO CHARISMATIC
=
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT DURATION BETWEEN REACTION INCLUDED VERSION AND ANOTHER ONE  TO SEE HOW SURPRISING, INTERESTING AND AMAZING THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS!!!!
Ps: I'm a Moomoo Vlogger. First time I've got this many likes ever! Our girls always deserve more. Hope they'll get recognition and success as much as their level of talent soon...
=
This is what mamamoo can do world! One of the best group to entertain the crowd
=
I will give this performance no 1!!!! 
=
As an international fan , All I can do is watching mamamoo’s songs on queendom watching frequently as support. Wish I could vote in person
=
Came back here for idk how many times and shocked because there's a lot of korean comments lately which is really unusual.
=
Amazing cover!
=
THEYSINGLIVE
NOLIPSYNC
=
IM IN COMPLETE SHOCK
=
2:12 MYY MANN
=
simple.....my queens forever i love you mamammooooooooo
=
They are amazing!!!!
=
Damn i'm in love with Moonbyul
=
Mamamoo: give me your songs we gonna make a cover
Other girl groups: *run*
=
Oh f- so many talent at once. My head is spinning from that charisma
=
"Mamamoo can only sing live because they can't dance"
Say that again?
=
ooooh
0:51 okay im just dead this is TOOO hot!!!
1:17 omg how tf cool she is
2:09 aaaahh is it legally to be soooo hot????? im in gay panic
2:32 DIVA
4:07 FINALLY THEY GIVE SOLAR A RAP PART (i can feel how she loves it)
=
precious seolhyun 3:55 <3
=
I swear if wheein is not getting married with me im gonna die
=
omg hwasaaaa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
solar is such a mommy i can't
=
Did they.....just.... incorporate Jimin's 'Puss' in 'Good luck'???
This has to be one of the best Korean Variety shows ever. 
I demand more shows for girlgroups like THIS.
=
I just love this concept soo much
=
3:24
THAT PERSON WITH THE BISEXUAL FLAG ON HER/HIS WRIST. YESSS
=
JAW DROPPING WOW.
=
Hwasa's stage presence is on another level. She has such a strong charisma that it makes me say STEP ON ME QUEEN HWASA
=
Can we just take a moment to Appreciate their beautiful healthy bodies. They are one of the few female idols that dont look like theyre being starved
=
Rapper Solar snapped!!
=
MNET: its okay to lip sync
SOLAR: APOLOGISE TO MY MIC NOW
=
mamamoo！！！
=
I don't even understand why this has so few views! It's such a great performance and cover!
=
Jimin: :O
=
Honestly Hwasa and Solars solo arrangement could work for the whole song
=
Who in here have a flashback when Solar said "i'm a mother father top madam"? 
=
Ohmaigoodness, I'm getting wrecked by Moonbyul
=
I love how they made this song feel like their own it didn't feel like a cover
=
they were suppose to give us one mamamoo version of good luck but damn they gave us five versions and that ladies and gentlemen is what we call  mother of all performance
=
Oh my Wheein stole my heart
=
Color me impressed! what wasn't I listening to them before? I stan
=
Hwasa is definitely the Queen. Wow I mean just W O W.. Her aura, existence, her everything. I can't take my eyes off her every moments.
=
loooool wheein coming down from the piano with a step thingy
=
so damn AMAZING Y R THEY STILL NOT APPRECIATED ENOUGH
=
I have no idea what this is for or from but that was AMAZING!
=
You contend so good 
=
mamamoo is next level omg
=
oh my god, they're killing me
=
I love it!!!
=
Woah I'm an elvis and, yeah, this kinda shocked me 'cause I always heard AOA version and when I heard Mamamoo's version I was just like O.o 
WoW this is amazing. I still like better AOA's version but now I have 2 Good Lucks in my Spotify playlist.
=
Don't let Loco see this, I Repeat DON'T LET LOCO SEE THIS
=
mamamoo saying good luck to us because next thing you know we be on the floor dead.
=
PERFECTION
=
Why didn’t I stand them before?!?!? I have listened to twit by Hwasa and famous songs by mamamoo like egoistic but this is bomb
=
5:00 Me pregunto si BOM estaría pensando en 2NE1 en ese momento? 
=
Omg whein so sexy
=
Speechleeeeeeessss.
=
There was a lot happening I...
=
moonbyul just questioned my sexuality wtf
=
This is what I call being an artist.
Mamamoo reasembled their concerts and career through this whole performance:
- The intro on the screen with Good Luck acapella / Um Oh Ah Yeah video acapella
- Hwasa bossy and raggae stage / her debut as a solo artist with 'Twit' (the choreography is similiar) and 'Don't' feat. Loco (the raggae vibes)
- Moonbyul slaying with her men chained up / her performance of 'Moon Movie' at S/S Concert 2018
- Solar being sexy af while kicking off the chair / her performance of 'Fever' and 'Fire' by BTS at F/W Concert 2019
- Wheein laying on her piano and being fatal as hell / her performance of her solo '25' at F/W Concert 2019

Mamamoo literally made their own concert in 5 mins.

p.s. at F/W Concert 2019 Solar managed to rap Moonbyul's part in their Debut Song called Mr. Amibiguous.
=
MAMAMOO QUEENS
=
Park boom look  so sad when she watch the mamamoo performed maybe she thinks her previous girl gruop and it reminds of her.
=
I can't take my eyes off Hwasa. She is a Queen of Koop.
=
Bruh MNET tried to sabotage Jimin soo much WTF. They used the same Jimin reaction for Moonbyul and Solar’s part. MNET needs to stoppp
Edit: I love the performance btw it was mind blowing and beautiful!!! These QUEENS SLAY ALL DAY!!!!
=
my heart 
=
MAMAMOO SLAYED SO HARD OMGGG !! ❤❤ I LOVE HOW FEARLESS THEY ARE WITH THEIR CONCEPTS!! YESSS!!
=
SOLAAAARRRRRR WHATDAFUCKKKJHJ SHE REALLY DID THAT.....I AM DEAD
=
they are the real QUEENS
=
Sun
Moon
In
Hwasa
Wow ♥️
=
MY QUEENS
=
it is time for me to stan
=
Boom
=
If i didn't know better, I'll be thinking that goodluck is their own song. They didn't just cover the song, they freaking owned it for 4 minutes damn that's mamamoo right there
=
Mamamoo can do anything and i love them for that
=
I like this remix
=
Watching this every time I go to youtube like a religion haha
=
Lee Da Hee is one lucky moomoo 
=
BRO WHY AINT THEY MORE POPULAR
=
Woaaa moonbyul 
=
lmao they covered mamamoo and mamamoo covered them
=
the way solar continue singing like nothing happened:’)))
=
Solar is a top, she said it herself.
=
The power mamamoo love u all
=
EVEN MY BRO SAID MOONBYUL COOLER THAN HIM
=
Ok the screaming girl looks kinda like Soyeon and an exact version of international Moomoo when we started watching this performance
=
Ok i like thisss❤
=
Hay diossss las amo tanto 
=
Mamamoo jjang!!!
=
If these girls don't win this competition I don't know, m fighting. They are queens their performance was amazing
=
:LIPSYNC?
MAMAMOO: NEVER HEAR OF THAT
=
So beautiful 
=
IHFINICNSXA OMGGGGGG YESSSSS GIRLSSSSSS
=
The best performance
=
The best!!! Mamamoo #1
=
Am I watching Immortal songs? They're the greatest artist and performers...
=
Eu to muito mais apaixonada do q era antes 
Uma apresentação extremamente incrível estilo MAMAMOO ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
omg they nailed it❤❤❤
=
Group amazing 
=
Moonybul destroyed me
=
that was powerful
=
byul be really giving all these male idols a run for their money. why be straight when moon byulyi the korean lesbian goddess exists?
EDIT: wow since this is getting big, let me just clarify that no, byul is not a lesbian. but straight or not, she's just really out there being her damn handsome but also pretty self, making even the straight girls swoon. and of course the lesbian ones go even more crazy. 96:4 female to male ratio for a fanmeet is something big, yup
=
かっこよすぎて鳥肌たった
=
I didn't even notice solar tripping before wtf..?
=
Jimin's face at 4:10....
=
This is great
=
I feel bad for them. They performed with all their hearts and still the hate comments come out, saying that there are too much different concepts in just 4 minutes so that they can't hear anything like the original version. What??? Mnet told them to COVER, that means they can creat their own styles into the song. If they just sing the song again with no different, it is not a cover anymore.
Btw, in MooMoos' eyes, our girls are doing such a good job ❤️
P/s: okay Mnake , you don't need to edit again and again one scene, make the vid 5:36 long so that the views... 
=
MY QUEENS ARE HERE
=
Queens of Queens
=
1:21 that girl is solarsido seol?

=
I'm shocked by wheein
=
moonbyul im gay for you
=
Solar what are you doing with your chest
=
I really love mamamoo ughh
=
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOLAR'S RAP!!! SHE SLAYED MY WHOLE EXISTENCE!
=
Mamamoo never disappoints. They hit you from every direction at the same time. Amazing, the talent these 4 artist have. Each member killing it.
US MooMoo? Hell yes!
=
0:12 is that Jimin? What happened she looks different.
=
I had a heart attack suddenly when Solar tripped... Please keep safe!!! But the professionalism remain
=
Perfect
=
mamamoo are too good holy shit
=
They were the only ones singing live are we surprised
=
Now THIS is a cover

=
Is this pamela swing 1:10?
=
4:10
1:51
=
just letting y’all know that you can download the studio version on itunes and spotify!!!
=
Moonbyul must be so uncomfortable doing those sexy moves, she doesn't like hip moves
=
I love you Mamamoo 
=
4:17 jakajs ja js
=
I'm still pissed that this didn't put in 1st place argh
=
At 4:57 Yuqi Soyeon and Minnie were like 
While the others are like
=
I just realized that Mamamoo is a little bit like a mix of 2NE1 and Girls' Generation.
Hwasa and Moonbyul have 2NE1 vibe and honestly Solar and Wheein give me SNSD vibe. Great mix, perfect group!
=
Can you just let us enjoy the whole song without that x reactoin
=
❤❤❤❤❤
=
That tiny aigoo sound from Solar when she tripped, proof that the queens never did the lip syncing. Keep safe Queens 
=
im freaking speechless when solar sang puss
=
They’re just doing what they do best, being themselves. I’m all here for it.
=
I didnt know that mamamoo can be more hotter than usual wow
=
Yeeeeeeeeeesssssss i dieing for mamamoo
=
QUEENS MAMAMOO
=
Im so gay for moonbyul
=
I really like this concept  their agency let them with their own concept , i mean 4 of them have different style 
=
Mumu of reacttothek should react to this. She'll be slayed.
=
SOLARS PART IS EVERYTHING
=
Omg i like more mamamo version
=
when solar covered jimins unpretty rapstar verse, damnn gurl I was shook when SOLAR STARTED RAPPING. Shes really living her dream, first the bow in her hair now the rap hahah yes girl
=
SHUT DA EF UP!  SOLAR JUST DID JIMIN'S "PUSS" FROM UNPRETTY RAPSTAR. OH MY GOD I'M DYING!
=
AE MAMAMOO ARE SO FANTASTIC
=
I cried because they are so amazing
=
moonbyullllllllll✨✨✨✨
=
let's give up on what if mamamoo sing good luck and watch this
=
Queens at kpop
=
so addicting
=
Stan talent! Stanning Mamamoo
=
4:39  ME ARREPIEI TODAAAAAAAA
=
Can you guys recognize that they are singing 100% live ????? 
No lipsync at all!!!
That's MAMAMOO !! Im stanning the right and talented group ♥️♥️♥️
=
I know Solar tripped there but may I bring your attention to Byul's twerk 3:31
=
They went  O F F .
=
Before all the haters can and hate on this amazing performance. Mamamoo and aoa concept of good luck are different and not all girl groups are the same. Mamamoo add their own charm and uniqueness to good luck so if haters do not like this performance please understand that aoa and mamamoo are different
=
How to be a Piano?
=
I'm actually so gay for Moonbyul I'm not even kidding
=
hwasa work hard bcoz 1 legend parkbom..
=
OMFG MAMAMOO IS THE BEST DECISION I'VE MADE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE

edit: I've never had so many likes so this only confirms that this indeed is the best decision lol - I love this fandom btw
=
Who’s that person that’s like they all went out bruh she pisses me off
=
Died 300 times watching this video. 
=
Ok who is the girl at 1:51 and 4:09 that has the BEST REACTIONS
=
Is this a concert of Mamamoo? Because they killed it!!
=
Jimin's face
=
Solar
=
QUEEN PROVES
=
Wheein here looks just like Red Velvet Irene
=
I GASPED SO MANY TIMES DURING THIS IT'S UNREAL. honestly, i shouldn't even be surprised at this point bc of how talented they are but WOW. LITERAL ICONS.
=
I thought it was xiumin but its moonbyul hehehh
=
I would like to hear it on spotify
=
4:03
=
GOD THIS OS WAY TOO SEXY AAAA
=
MY STARS
=
this is why i stan mamamoo
=
Luckily Yongsun didn't fall tho. My heart stops beating when she was slipped
=
OK BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
=
Mamamoo just gave us 4 different interpretations of "GIRLS ON TOP"
=
Mamamoo nunca deja de sorprenderme... Son un gran icono del Kpop 
=
no offense but for me this one group and soloist, can win this compettion, it's between mamamoo sunbaemin and park bom sunbaemin.♥
=
Moonbyul ya about to kill me!
=
Wow 
=
4:06
=
Nothing can stop Solar 
=
"mamamoo have stable voices because they don't have hard dances"
they said
=
1:52
4:05
=
when I see this for the first time, I didn't notice that solar slipped. She is a pro!
=
1:51
=
They captured my sexuality with this one.
=
Kumbaga sa isang room sila yung pabibong group HAHAHAHAHAHAHA loveyouuuu
=
Mamamoo can't dance huh? Plus with that LIVE vocals? 
=
I fell in love 

I wish I'm not late to be a fan.
=
so greattttttttt
=
2:10
=
1:17
=
I think we all needed this 2:07
=
Mamamoo are crazy insane  On fireee
=
*you know you're the queen when you make girls scream like that*
=
I love mamamoo
=
Please invite #DREAMCATCHER to perform!
=
❤️❤️
=
They didn't just covered this song, they freakin' owned it, slayed it. Well done my queens
=
Mamamooooo whyyy can you do this to me??? The whole song gives me goosebumps!  PERFECT PERFORMANCE
=
Sorry because mamamoo is only Group is singing full live in queendoom?
=
=
I can see how this made it to the top 2. They have a case for top 2. AOA fans were saying it doesnt sound like the original at all... Isnt that the point? Making a song your own? And the reason AOA only got third is because this has more should i say fan interactions. I have yet to watch the omg performance. I wanna see if it beats both aoa and mamamoo.
=
I started watching this stuff today because spotify had some songs and I was like queendom?? My girls covering other girls?? When did this all start and happened ndjdmejdnej
=
And wheein did all that despite being sick.i wonder what would she have done if she was fine.
=
I'm a neverland but I like this stage.This deserve 1st place
=
Gilaa sih lagu kalau mamamoo yg nyayi jadi warrbiasaahh
=
Mamamooo99
=
Fav part 4:38 
=
Solar so sexy 
=
If they don't win this round, this show would be a joke
=
Mamamoo is da queen on stage. Don't fight me
=
My babies 
=
Mamamoo las mejores! No me canso de verlas tan distinto al concepto original pero para mi es mejor!!
=
live version sounds so much better than the studio version
=
I love solar she is great
=
solar accident and hwasa sing wrong lyrics (double good luck giri giri i like you at the end) prove that they are singing 
live
Queen!
=
Do cool!
=
wheein, stop, u r killing me:')
=
VOCAL QUEENS MAMAMOO
=
Hwasa made me want to be the floor she did the booty roll on.
Moonbyul made me want to be the backup dancer she had chains on.
Solar made me want to be that chair.
Wheein made me want to be that piano. 
SO
HOT!
=
This stage on fire XD
=
WHEEIN JESUS 
=
2:08
=

=
2:30
=

=
Wow oh my got
=
Moonbyul that swag that your holding this performance issssss bop
=
3:27
=
Mamamoo the best girls
=
Mamamoo should not be in this competition bcoz they already THE QUEEN ...
=
A Bom não tem expressão mds, ela parece que ta nem ai kkkkkkk
=
Still can't believe they put mamamoo first to perform, but i guess it shows all them girlies scared of the concert queens.
MAMAMOO DID A MAMAMOO. AGAIN. ALWAYS.
=
Power!
=
Rankings for this evaluation:
1. Oh My Girl
2. Mamamoo
3. AOA
4. Lovelyz
5. Park Bom
6. G Idle
=
Jimin's face when she heard Solar rapped her "Top madame" bit in puss.
=
YASS
=
I don't know if you notice that they have their own microphones, cz it's been a while since I noticed that they have those matching microphone
=
2:04 2:09
=
LISTEN if solar says she is the top thEN SHE FUKIN IS
=
Damn
=
เกมือนยังโอมเลยแม่ฮวา
=
I didn't know this exists
=
why isn't anyone talking about wheein?!?!  she's such a goddess out there! uwa
=
2:09 Jiho
=
In fact,l like the normal good luck
=
Love itttt
=
Moonbyul me hace dudar de mi sexualidad.
=
All audience vote for them They get full mark for the audience vote
=
Solar:girl's girl's on top
Moo moo:Mamamoo
Yeahhh
Make some noise
=
This creativity, the thought to each performances. This right here deserve the first place
=
Hyejeong saying its okay when solar almost slipped really got my heart . Love both group . Talented .
=
This suits them so much! They should do this more often!
P.s:Stable queens!!!
=
"I'm the top"
OooookkkKaaaAyyy solar-ssi
=
They got FULL SCORE from audience boi
A total of 7000 now who said they are mess?? 
=
DAMN WHEEIN IS SO STUNNING
=
AAAAAACKKKK MY HEART OMGOMGG I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO COMPLIMENT, AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS GIRL GROUP CAN'T BECOME AS FAMOUS AS TWICE AND BP
=
MAMAMOO XD
=
1:21 Girl, I feel you. With the bottom of my heart.✊
=
Ok I love hwasa but the way she says "girls girls on top. Boom boom beat drop" makes me laugh idk why 
=
I need a night with Wheein 
=
2:30 wheein  I'm entering gay panic what is this woman doing to me
=
Solar is the definition of professionalism, I love you mamamoo ❤❤❤❤
=
Wow! You got my heart mamamoo ❤️
=
Mamamoo's stage always catch my eyes.
=
Moonbyul had me screaming
=
I just watch queendom for g-idle lol but after watching this i became a fan of them and gay too especially for moonbyul but no regrets HAHAHA
=
mamamoo！The best
=
So mamamoo wants me dead huh ?
=
THIS IS LEGENDARY
=
WHEEIN OH MY GHAD
=
Daaaaaymn they killed it !!! They so fab
=
MY QUEENS
=
Best Cover by ever❤❤❤❤
=
y’all know that mamamoo are hella good with acapella and vocalsss 
=
Jimin’s reactions are the best❤️
=
SLAYED.
=
Omg i like Solar's part so much
=
QUEENS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
Seriously this is why mamamoo's concert is so damn worth watching!!! I've seen them once live and omgg no regrets.. definitely go watch them at least once in yr lifetime!!!
=
Omfg moonbyul walking in with the guys on a chain. One of the hottest things i have ever seen. Plz god let me be the backup dancer next time moonbyul does that
=
Knetz are losing their tiny minds yet again. Who’s surprised?
=
Moonbyul went and wrote a whole new rap for this. Queen of rap, queen of lyricism! This is why she's the top credited in the 3rd generation 
=
Just wanna say I got BTS's War of Hormone MV as an ad and i didn't skip it
=
i think aoa reactions are not fully honest, they seem edited, i genuanily thought they would be more hyped, i am an elvis for 6 years and i fucking loved this
=
My mouth is still wide open and it hurts ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Mamamoo perform like they are the veterans. Something that gg this era can’t do.
=
Why wheein so beautiful day by day
=
1:50 4:09 Same reaction Mnet edit it
=
Whatever song Mamamoo sing become a bob 
=
Okay! No one can beat their vocal 
=
Basically moonbyul being better than any of your kpop boys
=
Cómo dejar de ser homosexual : 00:00 5:35
Ahre :v
=
GODMAMOO
=
MY GİRLS
=
can someone please tell who's the girl at 4:26 please 
=
CALL AN AMBULANCE ASAP 1:21
=
Damn
=
Ma queens
=
Okay mamamoo has no chill
=
Jimin's Face @ 4:09 
=
2:09
=
Putangina byul mamatai ako dadi WHEE JUSKO YUMMERZ
=
ฮวาซากูคิดว่ายังโอม
=
this permance Mamamoo saying: "don't mess with us!!!"
=
They got 2nd place with full audience votes!
=
for those who said that they are lipsync, your totally wrong MAMAMOO vocal is amazing you can't tell if they are lipsync or not. One thing about MAMAMOO last time they tried lipsync but ended up they dont like it because they said its harder to lipsync for them because they need to dance to the beat too. Remember you all that MAMAMOO is Queen they are VOCAL QUEEN and slaying all the time.
=
Everytime I watch this, I still can't get over Moonbyul's swag. seriously, he girl crush power is too strong.... she is even cooler than a guy!!!
=
Some people really called this mess. I just saw the fun in this. They had fun performing this. I love it! This is number 2 or 3 for me!
=
4 seasons, 4 colors, 4 girls. Absolutely one word: STUNNING!!! 
can whee just chill like she's been bad for my heart lately,, :---(((
=
No one:
Solar: im the top ;)
=
I thought minhyuk of btob is in military? Why is he here? 
=
Their visual and talent are perfect  damn these girls are truly fucking amazing
Also, i love moonbyul-oppar 
=
Compare 1:51 with 4:09. Same reaction footage lol, with slightly different zoom scale and footage duration.
=
Can we talk about their stage presence
=
2:11, yeahp that's me
=
why do they look so shocked lol i mean they’re mamamoo
=
Moonbyul.... i’m dying in her handsome and sexyness 
=
Istg I've rewatched this so many times but I can't help feeling that even tho mamamoo had the stress of performing first twice they set the bar for the other teams very high
=
aaaaaaaa是我妈木了！啊啊啊啊啊啊！GOGOGO FIGHTING!!!!
=
They are not like every other femae kpop groups. MAMAMOO ARE REAL TALENTED ARTISTS. I stan pure talent!
=
Well , what do you expect ? Its Mamamoo Ladies and Gentlement !  My GG is on fire  
=
Woaaaa  Best  I like this stage 
=
*Sometimes i forget that hwasa is the maknae*
=
The moonbyul raps kills me 
Too perfect
=
i'm gay for moonbyul:)
=
For those not familiar with MMM,  I think the concept of MMM was to give off a 4 in 1 performance similar to their MAMA stage in Japan where they were wearing all-red. This performance is not meant to just be a recorded cover that you're supposed to listen to on spotify. This is a performance meant to be seen.
=
Even though it's a cover song but still they killed it 
=
4:08 Jimin from AOA got mad lol
=
They own the stage Periodt
=
I thought Rihanna is with them 
=
Talent group 
=
Soooooo sexy. Luv u all<3 they r the best!
=
SOLAR WHY SO STABLE?!!!
=
Actually i prefer this version than the original one

BTW the whos the next so sexy
=
All members in Mamamoo  enjoyed their stage very much, not just for competition or something else.  This is why I love them so much and repeat this video again and again. They always be true and powerful to show their special song , efforts, enthusiasm and  confidence  Love Mamamoo forever. ❤️❤️❤️
=
VOCAL QUEEEN PERFORMANCE QUEEN!!!!!! I LOVE YOU MAMAMOO!!
=
Mamamoo is the best in my heart ❤️
=
wheein in fishnets.... coming after my bi heart right there!
=
who's that girl with scars .. shes so cute
=
Defintely MAMAMOO. Outstanding performance
=
Wth am I the only moomoo streaming or what? WHERE U AT FELLOW MOOMOOS????
=
SOLAR : I'M A MF TOP MADAM
ME : YES YES INDEED YOU ARE!!!!
=
as usual Mamamoo never dissapoint me. Hwasa you go girl. How can she become so charismatic on stage
=
QUEEEEEEEEENS!!!!!!!!!!!
=
i love how no one in the comments didnt even say a word about when solar tripped
=
People who calls Mamamoo stage messy must never seen 4 people 4 colour concept. This is how they 4 perceived the songs and how they want to express it individually but still in 4 people harmony.
=
Lol the sexy battle between AOA and MAMAMOO is real! Not talking about skill, MAMAMOO, Bom, and AOA are the queendom battle and the rest are more like the Princessdom since they're younger :P
=
Mamamoo are the MF revolution. QUEENS! 
=
my korean mommies
=
I’m so sick of haters trying to discredit MMM and their efforts! The girls slay, whether you support them or not. They perform how they like, so you might as well focus on your faves. Our girls, despite constant hate come back better and unbothered.
=
OPPA BYULLIEEEEEE
=
The literally mad that song theirs
=
Still in awe of what happened, everybody was good. But only MAMAMOO is singing 100% live, shouldn’t Queendom make everyone sing live for a competition like this? Its not really fair.
=
Ok maybe I should stop commenting but I cant stop fangirling.
=
Hwasa is so fierce, Moonbyul a handsome woman, Solar is so gorgeous and proffessional even if she slipped, and Wheein being sexy! AaaAaa they are so powerful!
=
our lead vocalist is rap..
im dead.
=
_i didn’t even realise solar slipped until I came back to watch this video for the 19th time this week_
=
Im a real girl but moonbyul is just can you stop
=
The main reason I started watching Queendom is Bom. Now, I just don't know. Mamamoo really knows how to give a killer performance!
=
I genuinely don’t think that was Jimin’s real reaction to Solar referencing her UP bars. Looks like a poor edit lol.
=
1:52 Solar's part was my favourite  I want a whole song of this version  I want to fly to South Korea and spent all my money on Mamamoo concerts 
=
Wheein’s entrance blow my wig away
=
This is my favourite out of all the stages in the second round. This is what I call sexy but not dirty. I've seen so many idols (group or solo) try so hard to be sexy but just end up looking so "dirty" and not in a pleasant way. But this, this is a good mix of class + sexy + confidence + badass and I love it so much.
=
The power in hwasa’s voice
=
I love how AOA also appreciate them and smiles sweetly
Love to see groups being friendly to each other even in a competition <3
Plz also give support to the original song :)) but this cover is lit
=
4:29 my favorite part
=
Mis reinas MAMAMOO ✊ son las mejores chicas!!!
=
are we supposed to survive this? Cause I died after the first 2 seconds
=
Moonbyul freaking murdered my soul
=
While I like other groups' performance, it is without a shadow of a doubt that Mamamoo totally slayed everyone in this stage of the competition.
=
1:20 OPPA MOONBYUL!!! 
=
RAINHASSS❤️
=
can we appreciate that mamamoo made one song sound like four different genres yet it all still sounded united as one
=
I never know that Mamamoo and AOA cover each other songs is something that i need in my life 
P.S: Hwasa and Kei are the same age. Just a kind reminder 
=
Concert feeling
#reallygoodluck
=
Moonbyul oppa wkwk <3
=
Wahhh moonbyullll
=
oh my god i'm gay
=
Wheein and Moonbyul thoughhhh 
=
my thousand time here kjdbhdjnjnd this is so good
=
Kei literally said the same thing as I did it really did feel like their own concert
=
moonbyul 
=
look carefully and you'll see Soyeon almost laugh when Solar slipped. or am i wrong?
=
Moonbyul quenn
=
Yass Moonstar get them linessss!!! Best rapper
=
The best performance in queendom 
=
I really like this “mess”. It’s so powerful and I’m focused the whole time, it’s so much fun!
=
OKAY BUT MOONBYUL SHUT UPPPPPPPPPPPP  1:15
=
There stage presence on 
=
They are too good for this competition though.
=
5:14 "I like me" - Hwasa

Mood.
=
*They even sang it live, the heck, they're slaying the stage so hard, I STAN TALENTED QUEENS*
=
THEY SNAPPED HARD ASF
=
I'm crying and dying watching this. Our girls are born to be the Stage!!!
Sooooo proud of being a moo moo.
Hope Yonsong unnie didn't injure her ankle :(
=
Tangina. Yun lng nasabi ko. Wala na. Gay forever nako. lalo kay Moonbyul. Ugh. 
=
I am not their fans. But this perfomance, o my god.. so strong
=
QUEENS QUEENS QUEENS
=
Mamamoo is that group that each member have overwhelming charisma, but one of them never outshines others they just blend perfectly. They really are a GROUP. It's make me sad when I see a group who have one member that pushed so much by the agency, even if they image truly like that. I mean Hwasa is like that, but when she perform as a group they blend each other perfectly, it's just show amazing their teamwork in my eyes
=
*MAMAMOO!! YOU BETTER EDUCATE THE GIRLS HOW TO PUT UP A PERFORMANCE!!!!!*
=
Ok but not enough people are talking about Solars performance like damnnn
=
I love Mamamoo
=
You can't deny that mamamoo is one of the best groups out there
=
Twice is in the ads then Mamamoo in the video, ok I'm full
=
this was the best performance in my opinion
=
The luckiest piano on the planet.
=
2:08 2:08 2:08 2:08 2:08 2:08 2:08 2:08
=
“It’s like a concert”, yeah, all of MAMAMOO’s performances seem like concerts  they’re so comfortable on stage. It really shows their professionalism
=
god Solar ! god Kim Yongsun !
=
GOSH WHEEIN STAPH
=
THIS IS WHY MAMAMOO ARE MY BIAS GIRL GROUP SLAYYYYYY SISTERS
=
OMG!!
=
1:30 *Unpretty Rapstar theme plays*
=
this was AMAZING!! loved every second of this performance!!!!! as always Mamamoo slaying the stage.
=
THEY ARE SO TALENTEDDDDD
=
AHHHHH MY QUEEEENSSSS
=
MOONBYULLLL
=
Thanksgiving allah
=
Mamamoo~
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
AAAHHHH
=
Unbelievable
=
Daeeeebaaakkkk!!! You want too kill me, dont you, mamamoo!!!?? This's like a concert! I'm sureeee
=
omg I got so scared when Solar almost slipped. my heart almost dropped
=
When you look at boom's eye, she kinda longing to perform as group
=
she slipped to let us all know they ain't doin any lip sync, queens i tell u, QUEENSSSSS
=
Solar finally got the size of the bow she wanted
=
唱功绝了
=
C H I L L
=
Hwasa is a diva.
=
Maknae hwasa on top
=
I kinda hate it when they dont finish wheein's performance like DUDES SHE HAS A LAST SAY. WHY DO WE HAVE TO WATCH IT FROM AFAR.
=
OHMYGOODNEEEEEES THEY JUST SLAYED ME SO HARD SPECIALLY MY BABY SOLAR
=
WHEEIN?????
=
Hwasa back dancer look so much like her 
=
necesito ver esots videos subtitulados en español o ingles ;(((((((((
=
1:20 That´s it, I´m bi now.
=
Even their concept is a little bit off... but i like the idea that they got to be a center of attention equally.
=
Really?? Why isn't anyone talking about Solar's slappin that booty at 4:16? That was so damn gay
=
MY GOD
=
Moonbyul - male sexy
Hwasa - 
Wheein - sexy
Solar - cute
=
Carregaram o programa nas costas puts rs
=
Let's aim for 2 mil in one day. We can do it
=
Omaigad!!
=
Essa menina aparece de todos os cantos eu escutei um barulho aqui em casa levei um susto achando que era mamamoo atrás de mim
=
Is this morning physical cultivating ?!
=
I'm not even their fan before but now I am and I really want to go to their concert
=
Hwasa makes me tremble, omg. She's such a goddess
=
=
wow !!!
=
MNET SNAKES, PAY THE PERFORMERS ON YOUR SHOW AND COVER THEIR PRODUCTION COSTS.
None of these groups should need to pay for the performances that are earning YOU so much money.
=
ive never heard these songs so it all sounds like a new mamamoo bop to me and im lovin it
=
=
Please, Mamamoo, record a second version of this cover based on Hwasa’s part. kkk It's perfect.
=
5:12 
Tbh if I was Hwasa I would like myself as well 
=
I married of Mamamoo I love the best Groupe
=
I need a cover pleeeeessssss
=
Moony rap
=
Daebaaaaaak 
=
I need a cover
=
byuliee 
=
DAAAAAAAMMMMMNNNNNNNN!!!!!! MY GIRLS ARE SUPER GIRLS!!!!!
=
Moonbyul daddyyyyyyyy ❤❤❤❤
=
1:21 the fan girl had a gay panic when Moonbyul appeared 
=
minha performance favorita dessa segunda fase, apesar de todos os outros grupos terem arrasado também eu continuei amando essa <3 minha torcida está para o Mamammo!
=
Hwasa Queeen i need Cover
=
1:22 is me when I saw Mamamoo for the first time.
=
Lol why jimin look so pissed off
=
Woooooooooooow 
=
When solar did Jimins rap from Unpretty Rap Star...THATS OUR SOLARRRR
=
They just did Good luck in 4 Colors. definitely Mamamoo style. 

I believe AOA's Good Luck was the least popular among their albums. Mamamoo might just bring it back to top chart.
=
4:56 soyeon's reaction is me
=
When Solar did Jimin's rap from Unpretty Rapstar I'm died jdjdjdj
=
=
But like. Isnt their concept one? Like their concept is early 19s where mafia and stuff is still ongoing?
=
The fact that every member got to show their abilities to kill us moomoo in each of their part is perfect
=
who wants Mamamoo world tour?
=
SOY LA ÚNICA QUE SE QUEDA CÓMO BOLUDA CUANDO VE A MOONBYUL SBIDKEKEKR LA AMO AAA
=
I think solar slipped on my wig
=
3:33 Soyeon be like: YES!
=
Too many tricks, they should save some idea to the following stage.
=
ฮวาซา = ยังโอม
=
Why does byul feel the need to wreck me over and over again
=
Mi bb solar❤
=
他より再生数少ないの謎すぎる
=
OMG
=
OMG
=
moonbyul did it for the lesbians
=
QUEENS
=
Oh.. Free concert there.. I'm blessed
=
I want to be the floor they step on. Please.
=
Some parts of this performance strangely match kokobop 
=
Ok no wonder they won
=
ARTE¡!!!!¡¡¡
=
Just want to let you guys Mamamoo just pull 80% on this performance, they havent show Solar poll or even Hwasa's legendary clothes. Eventually they already pull out Moonbyul 'chained guys' on this performance. Welp same like Wheein, (btw I love her long hair I cant event talk about it) Overall, mamamoo talents doesnt have an ending. They can pull of so much genre in the next episode.
=
MAMAMOO SUPREMAS
=
momoos
=
Park bom è sconcertata
=
este performance fue demasiado aasiodjoiasjdoijsaoijas
=
solAR s T O P iT adfshnfvbslhefbavekn
=
Each of them are amazing ❣️
=
Goddess
=
4:06 Mamamoo's lead vocal just sang the part of AOA' s lead rapper. What are you trying to say, ma'am?
=
What`s Up? 03:41 Solar figthing¡
=
their energy and talent is just on another level
=
WOWWWWWW I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
=
THAT SOLAR BOOB POP WAS UNEXPECTED YES QUEEN
=
I love that they gave a nod to Jimin's Puss in there I haven't heard that rap in so long also found it funny when all of AOA turned to look at her at that part lol
=
Why Mamamoo only one perfomance? (G)idle Bom and Aoa 2 perfomances and presentation:c need more this girls
=
0:32 what happened to her nose :((
=
"How many wigs, gay souls, ovaries are you gonna snatch in this performance?"
Mamamoo: "YES."
=
i c o n i c
=
Queen  
=
西芳族。西方族
=
Oh ma gawd did solar just say that she's the top madam? I am shoook.
=
This is originality at its best. Making a whole song and stage their own that you can't even recognise the original is artistry defined. Goddamn
=
they even incorporated some rap from unpretty ;p
=
hwasaaaaaa. ..ughhhh
=
This performance is almost reaching the highest level! I can't believe this song is from AOA. It's almost a new song!
=
*I'm so gay for Minhyuk oh sorry for Xiumin again sorry for Moonbyul* 
=
crazy fans 3:22
=
1:51 4:09 ????
=
Lol they owned the song! is this really a cover? dear stage floor, no trippin our solarshido aight?
=
With that look, Hwasa is two seconds away from drawing a gun and saying: "give me your wallet, punk!" :)
=
Am i crazy or is hwasa actually wearing a durag??
=
Did mnet really have to interrupt and repeat all those parts? I really didn't like the editing, they added a whole minute to mamamoo's performance. Why didn't they do it to other groups?
=
04:07 *FUN FACT:*
The reason why all AOA members looked at Jimin and Jimin went "bitch, whaaaat?" is because Solar rapped Jimin's UPRS winning song "Puss". Mamamoo really studied their homework well 
=
hwasa
=
thee bestttt!!!!
=
do they have lyk a clean version of this performance?? w/o backstage reaction??? this is sooo fcking gooodd i wanna enjoy itt
=
BUENARDOOOO
=
hwasa 
=
圧倒的女王感(゜o゜;
=
0:18 4:28
=
this is my ninth time watching this  can't get enough of mamamoo help
=
 love them
=
moonbyul making me question my sanity
=
Sad knetz disliking this video because they can't handle confident and sexy ladies putting on a charismatic performance 
=
Mamamoo is just perfect  k girl Group...
=
All is ok, they was excelent but I need to say that they had a error and this is a competition so the other groups have more advantage
=
so we're just gonna ignore how amazing wheein was in this?
=
QUEENS 
QUEENS 
QUEENS 
QUEENS  
         MAMAMOO 
=
Yo yo mamamoo
=
=
wtf moonbyul mommy
=
that girl who almost died for screaming when byulie started rapping. .haha. . i feel you ate. . im.drooling. haha
=
i know everyone is talking about hwasa but i swear i’m so gay for solar
edit: i’m new to mamamoo and before i commented this i had no bias but this video made solar my bias
=
Solars dress look like LE dress
=
Hands up for Mamamoo! 
=
HWASAAAAA I'M DEVASTATED
=
LOOOOOL jimin looks so mad the whole time
=
Wow
=
Their reaction after wheein appeared they were like "how can a puppy be this sexy"
=
Mamamoo made their own I Got A Boy iconic!
=
Wow
=
Amazing how Jimin does the same shocked/*lowkey* insulted expression at 1:51 and 4:09
=
Me during the whole performance 1:21
=
I don't know why but everytime i keep repeating this video because im  fricking GAY for them and then see Solar had slipped. My lifespan just keeps getting shorter and shorter, because of both...Im GAY AS HELL FOR THEM and idk why but it hurt me when she slipped. Shes okay tho so i  confuse myself
=
Queens  always carrying!
=
im gay now
=
Hwasa queeeeen
=
moonbyul flaca te ama
=
Noone:
Every single Moomoo when they see mamamoo: 1:21
=
Putangina byul mamatai ako dadi
=
I wanted to see the more of the other groups reaction to moonbyul rap
=
Mamamoo is a great performer and divide their parts equally that everyone shines. So amazing
=
Hwasa definitely born to be on the stage. She is literally just so amazing.
=
marry me moonbyul!!!
=
Tell me they won cause if they didnt thats unfair
=
Mamamoo brought life to this boring hell song from AOA. LOL <3
=
Wawwwww 
=
a quien puede no gustarle !!!!! las amo !!!
=
03:37 im living for Hyejeong supporting Solar ♡
=
Wow
=
Queens
=
4:06 solars rap omg
=
Actually this is what Mamamoo ALWAYS does in their concerts  As Momos we are so LUCKY that we can often see their stage full of pasion and art. If you feel interested in them, pls take time watching their Immortal stage or their Concert Performances ❤️
Mamamoo never stay the same, but also never lose their individual identity. Even just in this stage you can see :
Solar is the mixture of sexiness and cutiness,
Hwasa sexy like a Gangster,
Wheein sexy and femini,
And Buyl is kind of bisexual attractive.
Let me introduce to you: Moomoo’s mama - MAMAMOO 
=
SOLAR IS A PROFESSIONAL QUEEN
=
THAT’S MY QUEENS!!!!
=
Mamamoo came to slay not play
=
I love her 1:54
my honey my queen ♥️♥️
=
I'm killed because Hwasa 
=
Hwasa is really really best! She is so powerful, talented and sexy MY QUEEN
=
MY STARS 
=
oh my this is so good
=
Never fail to shock me
=
Umm whoa 
=
❤️❤️
=
واااااااو
=
Slayed!!!
=
Hwasa sang I like you twice
=
I waited a lot of days to find a comment about the girl screaming at Moonbyul part :(((( Still waiting
=
شنو هالابداع نعلله
=
can't get over this "drop beat" voice in hwasa's Performance b4 she gets down
=
I want to see loco reacting to this boi once again fell for hwasa charm
=
they dead ça wsh
=
Señoreeee Mamamoo is just WOW!!!!!
=
4:57
ボムちゃんの眼差しがなんか泣ける
ボムちゃんもとぅえにメンバーとやりたいだろうなぁ
=
Solar.......!!!
=
 MY   QUEENS 
=
Mamamoo owned the Song so well like its ther Original Version  I hope their version is available on Spotify 
=
The backup dancers are everything
=
I really cant stop watching this over and over again ❤️
=
Jimin’s reactions killed me
=
I honestly like this version better! The reggae feels to this song was perfect
=
Lovelyz Kei reaction like she really want to be sexy like that but she can because she so cute and not suitable with sexy concept 
=
Jesus Mamamoo, they are such a good group. Stunning performance!!!!
=
Can’t stop watching this, just wowwww
=
Sigo con la boca abierta
=
What show is this cause it looks fun! Mamamoo tho damn they always go next level and I love it
=
 QUEENS MAMAMOO 
=
*Mamamoo making queendom their own concert for 5 minutes*
=
THEY ARE THE BEST GIRL GROUP IN THIS GENERATION AND YOU CANT DENY IT
=
I'm obsessed with this Version !
=
But like doesn't it look like park bom really misses her group looking at mamamoo?
=
Man, I NEVER smile at performances. I had a full-on GRIN the entire performance. So epic!
=
If they don't win after this performance, we're burning mnet's building down.
=
Mamamoo is one of the best things that happen to K-Pop. 



Also... Mnet never recommends Mamamoo's videos to me, is always the other videos groups.
=
WAHHH 1.2 MILLION IN JUST 14 HOURS WAH MAH QUEENS!
=
you know... I would let any one of them (specially hwasa) to step on my throat with stiletto heels if they wanted. Just saying
=
I'm a casual listener of Mamamoo and don't really follow their stages. It so happens that their Queendom performances end up on my feed so I just got to comment here that damn, Mamamoo is a POWERHOUSE on stage.
=
Wheein omg gurlll ❤️
=
I feel like bommie when she watch mamamoo she miss 2ne1 Does anyone feel like me.
=
I heard AOA covered Good luck and egotistic 
=
4:28 นึกถึงสามช่าบ้านเราเลย55555
MAMAMOO สาวแซ่บ สาวแบดบอย สาวเซ็กซี่ สาวโรแมนติก <3.
=
I wish there was a fancam for this
=
Girls, girls on top as always my queens!
=
ma ding ding dong goin hard
=
if Solar's mistake wasn't repeated i think i wont even notice that. They nailed it once again 
=
OMG Mamamoo never failed me! Riseeee and shineeeee♡
=
Solar’s part got me deaddd
=
Congrats MAMAMOO for winning 1 place



In my heart ❤
=
Okay, Wheein is now my fave.  The girl's got soul - her vocals is powerful and she's cool - the uncommercial one of the group.  I like her.
=
mamamoo #1 in stage presence ALWAYS
=
I don't like sexy concept but they are cool
=
I'm waiting for their concert.
=
I’m cheering in my room as if I’m there watching them live
=
Damn...‼️‼️‼️ The diva 
=
*so it turned into another slapping mamamoo concert*
=
I couldn't count how many times i watch this video. To see if the views as well. Fighting #mamamoo
=
5 version in 1 song=
Hyejin - Fatal
Byulyi - Girl crush
Solar - Sexy
Wheein - Charisma
Mamamoo - Mamamoo
=
Omg Wheein Need More
SEXY CONCEP
=
https://youtu.be/OSSEsi_hTc8
=
am sooooooooooooooooooooooo gay for hem
=
After watching this, i forgot how the original song like
=
Am I the only one who find Jimin reaction at 1:50 and 4:08 some offensive? I'm not a AOA stan, sorry if i'm wrong
=
pls just step on me you four godnesses
=
Perfect!
=
The QUEENS !
=
OMG hwasa calm down
=
My Queensland omg
=
it's almost medley
=
❤❤❤❤❤
=
mamamooはあまりしりませんでしたが、これ見てから注目してます。
タレ目の口の大きい人がいいですね。少女時代スヨン、Gfriend　ソウォンとおなじFUJIYAペコちゃん系の顔ですね。
このパフォーマンスはちょっと凝りすぎで印象がバラバラですが、さすが実力派です。
ただ個人的にはチョアが好きなので高音部分がなかったのが残念。
=
Woooooooooow
=
ฮวาซานึกว่ายังโอม
=
I just need Moonbyul to take me out please.
=
What is the name of the show?
Thanks
=
Personally my favourite Queendom performance of this round, especially since each member got to show her charms!!
=
i… my bi heart… moonbyul's growl gets me every time!! absolutely love wheein's hair like this. i just— these queens!!!
=
Mamamoo just makes me forget of my sexuality everytime I watch them omg!
=
Hwasa: maknae who??
Moonbyul: she dont spit fire, she is the fire
Solar: 30 and slaying
Wheein: slayingggggggg!
=
Agko labay ya, antuya abuyak.
=
5:01 sorry to interrupt but Bomi is such a baby ❤
=
STAN ARTISTS!!!
=
ok but moonbyul's part...



*gay panic*
=
Jimin looks so offended eye-
=
3:50 fav dance part of breakthrough twice, anyways mamamoo and g idle slayed this performance so much
=
Mamamoo are the real queens for totally changing up the song and making it their own, highlighting each of the members' charm. They owned the stage and owned the song. 
"It's like a concert" YASS GURL. This is what years of performing LIVE on stage makes you become: A true performer. 
Thanks Mamamoo! xx
=
No one's gonna comment how hot WHEEIN is in RED? 
=
girllll, the charisma, the talent. mamamoo is literally on another level.
=
1:51 4:10
=
Who is the group that are wearing like army outfits???
=
Mamamoo is that girl group where all members break rules and don't mind what other says. They will do whatever the hell they want and will rock every concept, no, will slay every thing they do!
=
I swear to god if Hwasa is native speaker, US music industry (or even world) will be shaking
=
Solar uhmmm-- I think I'm gay 
=
Mamamoo bring the new concept itself, by showing every members own colours n making it like a mini concert in 1 songs. Risk taker.  Most important the live vocals that u still can clearly heard over the playback. Im not a fan of monotonous vocals so with mamamoo i can easily recognize voice of each members. Its a brilliant perf.
=
If this is immortal song then probably mamamoo win their 4th! 
=
solar’s rap is very surprise
=
Hwasa, Wheein and Solar channeling different types os sexiness. While our dear Moonbyul here is making ovaries explode. 
=
Wheein so beautiful
=
HWASA’S STAGE PRESENCE IS UNREAL. SHE IS A QUEEN.
=
It's seeing them like this is what make me so damn proud
=
I love how seolhyun always seems to enjoy every performance... 
Mamamoo are queen. Everyone in this competition are queens. I love watching all of them perform!
=
El concepto que usaron no esta mal, pero siento que no pego en nada con la canción, no me gustó...
=
1:49 and 4:08 Really MNET? I see what you're doing 
=
Is the Best swag i ever seen
=
Jimin's face is priceless
=
SOLAR's RAP İS AMAZİNG
=
Okay Solar. I see you and I still love you!
=
Im turkish fan i love you mamamoo
=
They are one of the groups today that sounded really good during live performances. I can't believe I will be able to see them perform on the 21st live. The power that these 4 women hold.
=
What genre is solar's part???
=
TOTALLY QUEENS
=
OH MY GOD MAMAMOO
=
Still stuck here :) And I'm loving it
=
Putang ina ang galing.
=
Why does jimin look literally like a dead zombie
=
AOA is proud  . The way they smile while watching Mamamoo singing their song are so sincere , i feel that  . And the moment Hyejeong said 'gwenchana gwenchana' after Solar almost slipped on the stage , i'm so touched  .
=
I don’t know how many times I have watched this and still went “wow” at the end. 
=
OMG all of them are burning meeeeeeee 
=
The outfits look a little cheap :/// not the best stage of them maybe because im used to better ones of them .. i hate hwasas and solars outfits so much im sorry
=
Mamamoo putting up real performance  Damn! My girls you're burning the stage 
=
Mammoo never disappoints
=
4:02 highlight
=
MAMAMOO HAS THE BEST STAGE PRESENCE OUT OF ANY KPOP GIRL GROUP. YES I SAID IT.
=
I just wanna hear the original, that I've never heard.
=
Hwasa is thicc
=
7,076,279 191014
=
Hwasa is my fav. 
=
Hwaaasaaa
=
Pleaseee hwasa pleaseee step on meeee!!! Damn
=
5:13 hwasa sings " i like me " :v
=
Moonbyul oppaaaa 
=
Queen Group
=
3:39 damn only queens will recover as fast as solar
=
Moonbyul oppaaaa
=
MOONBYUL W THOSE CHAINS IMMDKFKDKDKDK
=
Jimin's reactions are the best omg haha!
=
This is how a performance is done, amazing
=
Wow!!  Unbelievable...
=
That stare in the end! Moonbyul will be the end of me.
=
The musics at the end reminds me of dangdut...
=
THESE QUEENS ARE ALWAYS SLAYIIING
=
Solar...... I'm lesbian
=
I just realized that she almost fell the first time I saw this I thought it was part of the performance
=
love how a shit ton of people didnt like the arrangement saying it was too messy, yet mamamoo still takes first place for this round
=
my wig now: good luck lucky go go bebe!
=
what is the name of this program?
=
Mamamoo have a way to turn things around and OWN it! 
*i was so proud while seeing the others reactions XD*
=
cada vez estas chicas me sorprenden más
=
1:51, 4:09
Don't know if this counts as evil editing but Mnet pls stop :(
=
I've just seen a bunch of clips from this show and I must say.
THOSE GIRLS ( from all groups) BE SHOWING EVERYONE WHO RUNS THE INDUSTRY. 
THEY ALL ARE SO POWERFUL. QUEENS INDEED
=
If I were the other artiste watching this I would have cried during moonybuls part WHEN SHE CAME WITH THOSE CHAINS YOU KNEW IT WAS OVER
=
I enjoyed this performance. My queens ! Each member put their own spin on the song. I'd say Hwasa and Solar's part was my favorite. I'm glad Wheein is back too! Go girls  hopefully they'll be in the top 3.
=
1:21 same girllll
=
Excuse me but moonbyul look like a daddy with bdsm kinks uhm ;-----;
=
They're the God of stage
=
Mamamoo just made Good Luck their song in their 4colors!! No one puts on a show like them and engages with the Audience like them mini concert!! I love my babies Moonbyul brought her chains!!! I love Rude Wheein and Rapper Yong!!
=
Alright, I do like Mamamoo. İt was an original idea to show different concepts but i think its just divided performance sooo much and i didnt really enjoyed the whole..except that,its really amazing they sang live, dance well and put an different and original idea. 
Overall; it was a good performance,for me i couldnt able to focus anywhere so i cant really say that i will die for this  but there is an effort which cant compare with something so...Good job girls. İ dont care who wins that show but im happy to see everyone giving their all. ❤️
=
What's the fandom name of mamamoo?
=
How many times I have watched this already? XD
Lost the count....
=
Do MAMAMOO know they own my life?
=
Im sorry but, why its better than original song :(
=
Moonbyul the nation's rapper, no one's doing it like her 
=
The chair solar kicked was so lucky
=
Can't believe that one skit that solar did where she was acting like Jimin in unpretty rapstar came true because she is literally rapping Jimin's part. Solar really out here spoiling queendom a couple of years before. I'M-
=
Solar recovered from her almost fall with such grace and professionalism, the members didn't even realize that she almost fell and i had to watch with the others group reaction to realize that too.
=
How could I forgot that Mamamoo is at their peak when doing cover <3
=
Byuldaddy
=
*You're looking right at the BADASS VOCAL QUEENS YASSS*
=
it looks like a full blown concert
=
IM SORRY BUT YUGI’S HAIR
=
where can i watch this full?
=
Mamamoo really are the best. They were all born to be artist and performers. They’re all charismatic. Every time I see their performance I can really see their passion for music and performing.
=
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
Monbyuuuuuul
=
I'm not even exaggerating when I say Mamamoo never fails to take my breath away. *now time to head for the preparation of my funeral*
=
Who won this round??
=
Y’all see this shit? THIS is what it means to give a performance! Mamamoo is that girl group you can’t deny with their stage presence and vocal prowess! Hopefully they get 1st place this week! ❤️
=
wheein really snapped here. periodt.
=
Can i love moonbyul with all my heart???
=
1:21 same sister ,SAMEEEEEEEEEEEE
=
Can someone please tell me the results
=
Is it me who think that they make the note higher than the original??
=
Where was Wheein during the practice? did she have another schedule?
=
Chương trình này tên là gì vậy ạ
=
this is art at its finest
=
*We stan, we stan.*
=
How to not be gay for Byule? TT can't she is more powerful than 100000000000000 of Oppas
=
Son las mejores
=
I am so into Solar and Hwasa, like there's no going back to heterosexuality :/
=
This show needs sistar 
=
Who here believe they will get the 1st place

=
This is it, it’s the time for Wheein to shine bright like a diamond, it’s time for the world to see how talented and precious she is. Once we Wheein, we can never wheeout ✨
=
I'm so glad this is their song choice. I'm so happy Wheein is finally recognized for her heavily, soothing yet powerful and extremely well-controlled voice. I know Hwasa and Solar usually get the hype for their strong and unique vocals, but truthfully, Wheein always was my favorite vocalist. I could listen to her voice and not get tired for years.
=
I swear NOTHING makes me happier than wheein getting recognized for her talent. NOTHING
=
This is a performance of a group who already reached the top and got NOTHING ELSE to prove to everyone. Mamamoo have the least to gain in this competition compared to the other groups.
=
WHEEINS VOICE CAN CALM THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. THIS IS A VERY EMOTIONAL STAGE, THEY IMPACTED SO MUCH TO THE VIEWERS AND YES THIS IS MAMAMOO.
=
Everyone should know that singing with a lot of air like Wheein is very difficult to control and she is bloody killing it!
I can never stop be amazed by how amazing her voice and techniques are!
=
The only k-pop group I would love to see live in concert: Mamamoo.
=
Who thinks this should be drama ost
⬇️
=
THEY ARE THE QUEEN OF VOCAL
 tap if you agree
=
Wheein's talent is undeniable. She has a gift and I'm glad she was able to showcase it here. Her runs were pristine.
=
Am I the only one that falls a little more in love with Whee In every time I see her?
=
I'm not even a Moomoo and I cried. This was so touching :(
=
WHEEIN IS SO UNDERRATED SHE MAKES ME CRY
=
mamamoo: screw the competition, we love our fans more
=
Other groups: LET’S GEAR UP AND IMPRESS THEM 
MAMAMOO : Let’s strip it all down & touch them with our SINCERITY 
AUTHENTIC MUMS the KPOP industry really DESERVES 
=
when wheein hit her first soft high note i started bawling my eyes out and i haven't been able to stop (literally. i know online we often say "i'm crying" but dont mean it - rest assured i can barely type this message through my tears)
her voice carries so much emotion
=
This is love letter to fans
rarely exist in this industry nowdays
=
Can we PLEASE talk about Wheein's runs?!?!?! I love songs like this that showcase her vocals, people need to know how angelic her voice is.
=
they don’t even care about the competition they just wanna show moomoos their love 
=
As called fandora.. They dedicated this for fans... not for competition... so lucky to be their fans
=
an old saying goes "wheein's voice transcends the space-time continuum"
=
WHEEIN’S VOCALS ARE SLAYING MY GOD
=
but wheein's voice is just like GOLD
=
The way Bom looks at their performance is something else..its like she loves it and reminisces a part of her life..
=
Bro how does Wheein look SO EFFORTLESS while singing THAT BEAUTIFULLY UGH MY HEART
=
Wheein is definitely this episode’s MVP!! Her voice and her look are all perfect  
Choosing this song is the best to show their love to fans and to each other. 
This song is so emotional  I feel teary every time hearing them sing this song on stage ❤️
=
wheein’s been my favorite singer for so many years i wanna cry just seeing how amazing she is every time :’)))
=
Whee in's vocals are always so underrated but im glad she shine so much in here.
=
WHEEIN 1:45 OH MY GOD
=
I'm not being biased, but every time WheeIn sing I feel like crying.
I really love them
=
Wheein's voice is so amazing, she had me crying
=
Their voices are amazing but Wheein’s voice gave me major goosebumps
=
When this song “I miss you” came out, it made me realize that Wheein is my bias. Her voice hit my soul the hardest. I fell hard for her lol
=
Wheein’s runs are always unbelievably clean. Amazing 
=
I wheein-ed since their debut and never once wanted to whee-out. 
As a fan who deals with societal pressure, self-confidence, family drama, and anxiety (diagnosed a few yeara back), I've looked up to Wheein. Her growth, maturity, and strength inspires me. I admire her and her talent so much. This performance is now one of my favorites, all because I can understand the emotions Wheein projects through her silky voice.
Thank you for everything, Wheein. Mamamoo is so lucky to have you.
=
Hwasa and Wheein: Soul
Solar and Byul: Story

= Sincere love for Moomoos 
=
WHEEIN OMFG IM SPEECHLESS ❤️❤️
ITS LIKE BEING BACK ON IMMORTAL SONGS
=
HIT LIKE IF THIS PERFORMANCE MADE YOU CRY
=
Wheein getting the love and recognition she deserves is my favorite song
=
*W H E E I N*
=
Wheein is a goddess
=
I didn't realize how beautiful & expressive Wheein's voice is 'til now..
=
No much preperations, no performance, no back up dancers. Just a VCR, minimal props and MAMAMOO standing there, giving all their emotions just to tell their fans how much they miss and love them. But this performance has the biggest impact and gave me all the goosebumps. The whole song was the highlight, no particular part to choose as the highlight. And i'm fckn crying right now 
=
THIS IS NOT COMPETITION, THIS IS A MAMAMOO’S CONCERT ❤️
=
Man, Wheein is such a goddess when singing in falsetto. It's so hard omg.
=
Wheein falsetto is so beautiful!!!! I am deceased !!!!!!
=
HOO WHEEIN YOU WON ME. YOU WON ME
=
I love the contrast between Solar's and Wheein's voices!!!!
=
Wheein can choke me with her vocals cause oh god oh wow
=
wheein’s voice just clears my mind, it’s so clean and soothing i feel it in my bones.
=
Once you Wheein, you can’t Wheeout
=
Jung Wheein is not here to play. 
What a freaking damn good singer.
=
i still can't move on from Wheein's voice. its just so beautiful
=
WHEEIN'S VOICE IS ALL I NEED IN MY LIFE!!!!
=
Wheeins voice is out of this world, I love them all but there is something that Wi does with her voice that it leaves me in awe :0!! no wonder they asked if she would be ok with singing this song, it relies heavily on her, and Solar too <3,.
Hwasa's raspy voice adds a nice flavor to it and what can I saw for Moon, her rap and deep voice steal our moomoo hearts every time :). Moon gave the idea to do this song for the fans too, she will be a great future CEO n.n
This performence will stay forever with us.
=
*This is how many times you fell in love with MAMAMOO*
↓
↓
↓
=
Omg Wheein literally slayed everyone with her first verses
=
yoooo wheein’s falsetto is insane + moonbyul’s beauty !!! I can’t believe ppl don’t talk about it more
=
Wheein's voice seriously gives me shivers. Another legendary I Miss You performance to make moomoos cry ;w;
=
WheenIn has this crazy amazing voice...
=
i love wheein soft voice,
I love solar high note,
I love hwasa husky voice,
I love moonbyul rap,
I love mamamoo voices,
mamamoo such a complete group that can do everything.
=
Wheein's voice is killing me. I'm crying
=
I like Wheein's voice so much...
=
When Wheein held that noteeeeeee I got chills
=
The amount of control Wheein have on her voicedaebak
=
Wheein's voice is like silk!!!! So beautiful to listen to! Mamamoo is one of the most inspirational music groups!
=
When Solar asked Wheein if she’s ok with the song choice, I didn’t get why. But after watching this, I totally understand. It heavily relies on Wheein’s vocals. And she delivered gloriously. 4 vocal beasts in 1 group. Why are they in a battle of comebacks again???
=
I feel like I'm descending into heaven listening to this 2019 version 
=
Wheein getting the love and attention she deserves?? We have entered an alternate universe and i never wanna leave 
=
Whee-in why u do this to my heart 
=
please recognize wheein, her voice daaaang. her voice is so special and also wheein, mamamoo will always be the best girl group. periodt
=
wow Whee In really shined in this song, I would totally listen to her cover of this song!
=
I always hungry with Wheein's voices
=
Omg Wheein's voice drive me crazy  such a beautiful voice
=
Nobody: “Most people seek perfect love”
Mamamoo and Moomoos: “We seek true love” 
=
WHEEIN WIN! My Heart
=
1:22 holy fuck wheein just went from someone i rarely noticed to my bias ♥
=
Yuqi: Her voice is incredible.
Same sis. Same  Whee-in 
=
wheein voice : 


=
Love their attitude: 
no matter if they aren't that big group band
they give the best, focus on their fans who really support them
What a big heart they are
=
I miss you Whee-in 
=
wheein is so pretty i want to cry
=
omg wheein is my ultimate bias someone fight me 
=
Wheein's voice made me cry 
=
I'm not a fan of mamamoo but i fall in love with wheein 
=
ONCE YOU wheenIN, U CANT wheenOUT. . Despite having the least screentime due to her schedule and being busy over album making, wheein definitely is the dark horse. Glad to have everyone appreciating her vocals in this vid.
=
Can someone tell me each of their names? I've heard their songs before, but never really got into them. After seeing this, I feel I should stan them.
=
Wheein is the best singer and best dancer among the four.
.
=
wheeins voice gives me the chills
=
I don't stan but I've always acknowledged their talents. Man the goosebumps
=
I Love you to Mamamoo To Wheein your voice is like a breath of an air in this stressful world
=
Wheein's voice made me cry so much
They are all so so so so good
Mamamoo is seriously on another level
=
I think this is even better than the original version i listened to years ago lol 
Their vocal technique has improved so much
=
Wheein's voice really dominated the performance man..
=
wheein 


thats all i have to say :)
=
Wheein's voice stuck in my head
=
It’s really meaningfull song. Though i’m not fan of MAMAMOO but i always look forward to their performance. Their voice, their gesture is really attractive. It's been a long time since I found a girl group capable of such a live song. I really like MAMAMOO. Hope they will grow more and more.
From Vietnam.
=
i never get tired with this performance. wheein voiceee. has been hearing for hundred times but still got goosebumps everytime i heard her voice.
=
moomoo : "so, how many radish you guys will harvest today?"
mamamoo : "all of them"
=
"We made it~" 
~Mamamoo
=
Can't stop crying even when the song ends, they always did that, they deliver their songs with emotions, even i don't understand the lyrics but their voices just shows how meaningful the song is.
Moomoos are so lucky! 
=
WHEEINNNN ❤️
=
Can't wait to see the upcoming I live alone hwasa n wheein. They are so cute n I miss wheein's smile 
=
0:40 Bom's face make me feel that she really miss 2NE1 so much.
=
They really put fans over competition. Moomoos the luckiest fan ever!
=
Not a moomoo but I LITERALLY CRIED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLEEE VIDEO
=
wheein's ooooOOOO uuuuOOOOOuuuuuOOOOOOuuuuuuuuu so mesmerazing!
=
Wheein i love u so much , you guys are amazing. I got goosebumps
=
Why am i Crying? Im not even a fan. Im just a listener.
=
wheein's voice just killed autotune
=
Such powerful vocals, one of the most talented kpop groups on the scene right now. This song in particular carries so much emotion
=
Wheein's voice gave me goosebumps. Wow!
=
After watching this video.. I search all about whee in.. I really love her voice.. 
=
Wheein shining here
=
PEOPLE!! Get in your positions, Wheein closed her eyes singing!! and MAMAMOO is after Moomoos!!
=
I just love this performance
=
I wheeinned, now i can't wheenout 
=
Honestly, this is the only comment section where I don't feel bitter about a particular member getting more praises than the rest. 
Because we stan all 4.
=
Jung Wheein!!!! ❤
Please step on me, oh my god, what a voice TT
=
Omg Wheein and Hwasa were so amazing! Gave me the chills. <3
=
mamamoo is the best vocal this era girlgroup who agree??
=
Wow, SOLAR's voice is exploding.
=
Becoming a moomoo will be my best decision in MY LIFE I SWEAR, these angels brings the HEART TO US ALL, Being a moomoo is the MOST PROUD THING I’VE EVER DONE!!
=
coming back for wheein's voice
=
Let me appreciate Solar’s ‘ Hwasa’s and Moonbyul’s vocal as well

4 of them MADE THIS SONG PRICELESS
=
Everyone: Puts on a performance to get 1st place. 
Mamamoo: Puts on a performance for their fans. 
Me: Damn I stan the right group!
=
Whee in
=
Even though I'm not a big fan of Mamamoo, but I have to admit I always liked their performance.  And to me this is a legend in Queendom.
=
It's amazing to see Solar, Wheein and Hwasa hitting high notes flawlessly, and Moonbyul takes care of the rap part easily as usual.
=
This is mamamoo, they always make me goosebump with every lyric coming out from their mouth ,luuv
=
I come here after watching I Love Too Mv to fully bawling my eyes remembering how much I love them. Never letting go 
=
Solar's voice evokes such a strong emotional response, I hear her voice and the soul that comes out of it and I just cry. This whole song is amazing
=
They should've won first place in this round, this is really unbeatable i have never been so addicted to a Korean song before
=
The first girlgroup that can make me cry by their song. Their voice ohmygod. Their performance tho, even tho i dont understand the lyricss ❤️❤️❤️
=
I completely fall in love with Wheein outfit.
=
Feel so peace with amazing voice wheein
=
I love you, wheepup  get better day by day. ♥️
=
Why they're cutting onions here 
=
I came here if I want to be calm  Their voice is so heavenly, especially Wheein 
=
Damn they’re such good singers! Slowly getting into MAMAMOO 
=
Ughh this is too much they all sound so good Moonbyul's clear honey voice harmonizing throughout the whole song ❤
=
i came here for wheein’s voice
=
it's too early for me to cry but here I am 
=
After watching this performance compared with their performed at M count 2016, I've been realizing that Hwasa improved better. She got more calm, gentle, elegant and smooth to get a high and smooth song like this. It's so happy to see her more comfortable with her unique voice and not to force it to be somebody else
Btw thank you for the writer this song, especially to boost Wheein voice talent. The world absolutely needs to recognize more her talent. That angel soothing voice. Gaahhh
=
Whee In voice is really............
=
They didn't need dancers or anything and yet they came out with a masterpiece. The perfect performance.
=
*MAMAMOO ARE THE QUEEN(DOM)*  
*WHEEIN OH MY GOD, SUPER BEAUTIFUL VOICE FROM THE START UNTIL THE END OF THE SONG* ❤❤❤❤❤
=
To MAMAMOO:
I just want you to know that we moomoos will love you no matter what. You are all talented and amazing person. Ignore those negative people and focus on the people who loves and support you . Just enjoy and do whatever you want. Don't stress yourselves. Eat healthy. We'll be here forever. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I got so many goosebumps just by listening them from the screen and I wonder how I would be if I was there among the crowd. I might be unconscious. 
They all are so amazing. 
=
This performance was beautiful! They are so talented it’s mind blowing!
=
Wheein’s vocals are so underrated
=
At the end of the day, what sets a good artist apart from the others is if they can pull off an impressive performance with just their voices
=
Then and now,  I could always say that Im a proud Moomoo.  Spread the Love 
=
Perfect, truly perfect
I wanna cry and I'm not even a moomoo
=
I Just Love them, and i won't seperate them into "boxes" Like "The one with the strong vocals" or "high voice", instead i have one thing to say: If one of them would leave, it would Not be Mamamoo
=
there's something about the way byul  raps that made me want to hug her
=
Performers: 
Editing team: wOAHAHHHHH
=
I'm not even their fan, but why my tears are flowing.. I don't even know the meaning. But I can feel their sincerety.. I might cry a river if I were their fans
=
I start to get shocked whenever I hear any high note from them, and imagine being shocked for 5:43 mins THAT'S WHAT MAMAMOO HAVE DONE TO ME
=
damn this group is so good..not into kpop.but their vocals are so impressive..
=
This performance will always be 1st in my heart. FANdora's Box indeed <3
=
As fans this means the world to us.
Mamamoo. You are the greatest gift Korea has given to the world.
=
This performance was so beautiful it made me cry, they’re all so so talented
=
I love my girls ! I teared up even by just watching this via my phone screen, I can't imagine the mess if I was there in front of them 
=
mamamoo serving us with their vocals again and again ! I love them so much ❤️
=
whats your favorite food
mamamoo: we eat tape 
solars high notes never disappoints me..
=
Can't say that they are not trying hard for Queendom because their versions of Decalcomanie, I Miss You here are even better than original versions vocally. It's just because we've seen them going all out in their perfs that we don't see the equal amount of hard work put into Queendom.
=
I keep coming back to this performance. It was so beautiful.
=
Solar is really the best voice
=
They have amazing vocals. They are the most talented vocal group in K-Pop. I especially love Solar's voice.
=
This is one of the greatest vocal performances of all time. Stunning. I want this played at my funeral!!!
=
The best powerful vocal girls group ever
=
I bet mamamoo has the best vocals among all the girl groups till today 
And I think blackpink,twice,red velvet can never beat them in vocals 
If mamamoo were from a big company they could have conquered the world till now but even now they are doing the same thing
=
Mamamoo has the best vocal lines and rapper. I stan them! I would love to watch their live performance
=
I don't know how I got here but his presentation was simply beautiful. Could you tell me what the group's name is? I would thank you a lot
.
=
ohh God  their voices are so amazing ♡✨
=
The way they easily belt out the notes are the high notes and low harmonies are so beautifully done  MAMAMOO FIGHTING
=
It's me again for the 100th time of watching! Just so love MAMAMOO
=
they're so humble throughout the whole show so I would never understand if people start to hate on them like seriously.. such queens<3  this was dedicated to their fans which is something not all groups focus on (not putting it as a bad way for the other groups performing bc i lovvveeee the others) but competition is the least of their worries
=
im crying. literally. because i just focus at the meaning of the lyrics. its good to have some1 or friends that accompany us through our struggle part of life. like when they are as a trainee
=
Who is crying here??
=
no one has anything on mamamoo. these ladies won a loooooong time ago
=
:( Wheein
=
Solar's bewitching high notes, Wheein's soul-stirring vocals, Hwasa's distinctive voice and Moonbyul's deep and melodic voice was astounding. Mamamoo I Miss You will be noteworthy.
=
I got goosebumps when moonbyul started rapping omggggg
=
las amo las amo las amo DESTINYYYYY
=
Theres so much emotion ❤️
=
Hwasa has such a gorgeous voice and so does wheein
=
i completely cry when the compilation video when they call us:""""""""""""""""""""""""") i love them
=
Bom said this performance reminds her of 2ne1 in ep9 n then it finally clicked, why have i been so interested in mamamoo in recent years? they really are filling my 2ne1 void in their own light, I love these girls as much as 2ne1, this song has been stuck in my head for the past 2 weeks Wheein you absolute gem, please come London one day and bless our ears<3
=
They are waaaay too good at this singing and performing things
=
finally i get to watch this! and heck i just literally cried when they showed their trainees days
=
2:14 my reaction
=
I'm glad it's "I miss you" and not "I love too (never letting go)". I might bawling more than this if K-Moo also included "I love too" into their recommendation song list
=
Im so happy coz Mamamoo won first place in this show. We must appreciate talent and dont ever sleep on it 
=
mamamoo too good at singing. i really can't tell you guy how much i love them.
sent some love from cambodia.
=
This is so much emotional~ I cant believe Im crying right now
=
I got tears in my eyes.....
=
Mamamoo is coming back for us soon 
=
the talent.. the sincerity.. oh my heart
=
how can this be so flawless? i really cant count how many times i got goosebumps while listening to this beautiful harmonization.
=
Mamamoo is such perfection! Wheein blew my mind away in here
=
I AM SO PROUD TO BE A MOOMOO!!!!! 
=
Mamamo vocal,, perfect,,
=
Great MAMAMOO !!!
Mamamoo secret weapon = WheeIn !!
unleash WheeIn....BoooM(Nuke them all) !!!



WheeIn : "Nah...its only 50% of my power."
=
This is my favorite side track and I can finally watch them sing lively. YES THEY ARE MAMAMOO.
=
My VOCAL GODDESSES of K-Pop. I love many idol groups but MAMAMOO is by far the best when it comes to vocal prowess 
=
Love this so much... wheein your voice 
=
Just cant help loving them all. :( Im glad I did discover them but quite sad coz.. why just now? Lol.
=
Still, because of this moment, I cried a lot. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH.
=
There is a reason why they are called Queens of vocal and there is a reason why most of their awards are based on vocals...
=
why am i in tears 
=
I cried without knowing while watching this performance. I’m truly thankful to be a MooMoo
=
QUEEN OF VOCALS U CANT CHANGE MY MIND
=
I love wheein voice so much!
=
gosh I remember the days  from a mamamoo from a small company to mamamoo being look up by other idols  MooMoo and Mamamoo really have a great tandem  it is such a heartwarming dedications to Moomoo from Mamamoo  thank you
=
They so beautiful and talented 
=
They make me so PROUD to be a MOOMOO! <3
=
I'm cryinggggg
=
Solars power vocals blew my wig to the back !! Yassss hunty!!!
=
This is Girl group quality.
=
Mamamoos in this for the fans ❤️ soo beautiful
=
hwasa: so much, I miss you!
kills me everytime! 
=
Goosebumps everywhere shooks im literally crying 
=
Oh snap, where's the tissues
=
WHEEEEEEIN OMG!!!!!!!
=
ISTG wheein's voice is so amazing!
=
I love this song. Omg. So perfect. I love MAMAMOO
=
The ones who said  me too 
=
real winners of this round was everyone that got to watch this masterpiece
=
I'm a recent moomoo and will forever be a blackjack! I just can't help being awed by mamamoo live... I'm never not impressed!
=
Almost forgot that this isnt a concert clip TT too much love for moomoos!!!!
=
First, fell in love with hwasa. And then moonstar. And now all of them....
=
Best vocals I've ever heard Galing!
=
I saw some twitter comment said MMM added the special video in the middle on purpose, just to gain other fandom votes. But being a moomoo myself, I know Mamamoo pure heartedly arranged this performance because they love Moomoos so much, not for the sake of gaining votes. They don’t care about winning, why would they perform just to gain votes? What pissed me off that the person who commented that said she’s a moomoo 
=
I almost thought Mamamoo is a special guest in this show ! lol
Yeokshiii. Queendom really needs Mamamoo.
=
I'm so proud  for our queens
=
now that mamamoo has won queendom, this song becomes more emotional  woaaaa... i love u mamamoo 
=
I’m tearing up
=
我被mamamoo 圈粉了。
=
I love Mamamoo so much!!! From Indonesia 
=
mamamoo make me cry 
=
IM CRYING 
=
Everytime I hear his song on my phone I always feel wanna cry. And now, watch they're sing with that stage. Finally make me crying for real
=
Mamamoo sometimes reminds me of Little Mix and vice versa
It's like
Solar = Perrie
Hwasa = Jesy
Wheein = Jade
Moonbyul = Leighanne
=
5.00 hwasa part of harmonizing 
=
watching  this everyday to make my day better 
=
I love Moonbyuls deep undertones in this.
=
Bom upvoted Mamamoo because this performance reminds her about their(2NE1) trainee days.

*im not crying, you are*
=
the video barely started and i am already crying, this is how powerful they are
=
Oh my god... im so proud of them all.... am proud of myself too for stanning them like crazeeee
=
This always tear me up 
=
Even i dont know the meaning of this song i cant stop crying :')
=
this is the best perf out of the 3 that had been broadcasted and I don't understand why this video get less views.
My queen, Mamamoo is the only girl group that I stan. Only stan talent 
=
this is mamamoo at their purest form. no dance, no gimicks, no backup, no special effects. just the pure raw connection between the members and moomoos, and of course their awe-inspiring voices. i am so proud to call these girls my ults.
=
i’m crying moonbyul’s changed part
=
They can catch ppl's hearts with their voices, raps and more. One and only, Hwasa + Amazing vocal, Wheein + Girl Crush Rapper, Moonbyul +  Explosive vocal, Solar = Mamamoo.
That's how Mamamoo was made 
=
cant even count how many times ive replayed this. and i cried every freakin time. IM SO PROUD OF MY VOCAL QUEENS!!!
=
Love them sincerely
=
1:42 your voice is just ... peacefull.. love it so muccchhh..
=
This performance sends
=
this song hits me everytime
=
Congratulations to Mamamoo!

I greatly respect them as to why they won.
=
they're queens of vocal in kpop❤
=
I'm crying 
=
I feel like mamamoo never had a bad stage, like ever. All of their performances have been amazing. If I am wrong, I'd like to see the evidence.
=
Mamamoo fantastic !!!!! 
❤❤❤❤
=
*I HAD GOOSEBUMPS*
=
I truly truly respect this four queen ❤ 
Mamamoo best vocalist
=
i keep come here to rewatch this video n how much tears this song want from me!!? I keep crying everytime rewatch this not coz i sad, coz i feel loved, huwee.. Mamamoo the bessst!!
=
This performance reminded me of Moonbyul's recent note in Mamamoo's fan cafe, where she comforted all the Moomoos who were stressed with all the senseless comparisons & hate they receive from other fandoms. Her words hit hard when she reminded us to remain kind and just exert our energy & effort to those special people in our life. And to let karma take care of the rest. This is exactly what this performance is all about. This is Mamamoo expressing their love for us in a way we would understand. They didn't come to please but to hug Moomoos with their music. This song left the worldwide radish family in tears. I don't need to see the ranking for this. Mamamoo already won my heart.
=
THIS LIKE A CONCERT
=
Bom's face broke my heart
=
HOW LOVELY. I'm SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS PERFORMANCE. YEAH, REMINISCING TOMORROW'S YOU, ME AND US.
=
I love them sm omg !! 
=
I became a Moomoo because of this performance. This is AMAZING. I've been missing out ;-;
=
mamamoo is the best :)
=
1:43 wow i got GOOSEBUMP
=
I'm crying I love them so much
=
moonbyul is beautiful. I like this so much. LOVE U MAMAMOO❤️
=
I laugh everytime I see solar's face in the end
=
This is making me cry.
=
The Great Mamamoo
=
Goosebumps. So much feels! 
=
i swear mamamoo is the most talented girl group i have ever seen in south korea
=
I don't even understand what the lyrics are but Wheein at 1:44 made me tear up forreal ❤️
=
This show how mamamoo love us momoos! Thats why we fans are really loving them so much and we continue to support them no matter what. 
Love u mamamoo your the best!
=
this is sooooo amazing 
=
This my favorite performance of mamamoo during queendom, its feel so sincere and touching
=
this is better than the audio version i always come to this performance 
=
The song. You need to subtitle THE SONG!!!
=
mamamoo reminds me of sistar back then, but sronger.
=
4:44 I really like this part
=
This is a winning performance,  because they won our heart ❤
=
IF YOU ARE NOT CRYING OVER THIS OH GOSH YOU ARE CANCELLED
=
Without realizing... I was already crying when the video started...
*The power of Mamamoo*
=
i didn’t even understand the lyrics but dang i felt it.  tears started to fall. 
=
Let the world here your voice, mamamoo, your voices can touch hearts of many 
=
This is what you call queens 
=
so... i saw this in my recommended a week ago. I'm just now getting to it. Words can't really explain but I started crying near the end. Their voices are so powerful. I love stanning so much
=
Im crying...  This is so beautiful. Thank you Mamamoo ❤❤❤❤
=

=
The change in lyrics, the vocals, the fan video, the pureness, and just beautiful classiness topped off with the confetti had me sobbing in the corner  thank you for this mamamoo<3
=

=
Park boms facial expression i feel especially more aware of it after she said she was thinking of 2ne1
=

=
Incredible singers 
=
Mamamoo just reminds me to 2ne1 
=
The hell watch this hundreds and each time i cry
=
eu tô aos prantos 
=
Why i've been cryyy?!!
=
Don't need ranking for this round,,  they sang for moomoos,, and that's a winning piece for the fandoms
=
Genuinely amazed by how good MAMAMOO is at maintaining their 2nd place in ranking
=
this song is very good! very nice melody, it keeps playing in my brain i can't stop it!
=
my queens.  i always cry when they sing this song. 
=
I thought "Amazing" isn't not enough to describe MAMAMOO

=

Then what would be the situation of korean momoos 
#BORN TO BE MAMAMOO
Mamamoo does everything so touched to momoos
=
Whein 
=
I teared up without even understanding the korean part TT
Imagine if I get to understand every words.

MAMAMOO is amazing TT
P/s: The part where they called moomoos in the clip, makes me feel that the fans are so loved and pampered (in a good way) by MAMAMOO <3
=
gives me goosebumps 
We love you Mamamoo from Philippines 
=
I love all of them, but Solar's voice soars and just rides a wave of sound. I am absolutely in love with her voice.
=
I cried AF. I'm so proud of my girls
=

=
Love mamamoo forever!!!!

=
Queens of vocal
=

Amei esse destaque que a Wheein teve, finalmente ela conseguiu brilhar!!!!!
=
Definitivamente cuando este triste escucharé esto para recordar que amo a estas 4 ángeles.
=
I watched it over and over again
=
Meus orgulhos ❤❤❤❤
=
I started to cry when Byul started rapping after the "Moomoo" part. MAMAMOO is so different and special.
=
Mamamoo the best voice in kpop
=

=
I just want to watch the performance... why am I crying?
=
Everytime i listen to them my mouth is always open lol
=
MAMAMOO SARANGHAE

=
"ART"
=
I love them but specially Wheein her voice is like an angel.
=

=
I'mcrying~ sooo much love
=
Best performance from mamamoo so far.
=
Watch again and again and again
=
I got goosebumps all throughout the performance 
=
4 divas come on! 
=
Theme song for I_moomoo  
Fight me
=
Moomoos cried a river...
=
Hwasa and her buttery vocal tone, ugh. I'm not a fan of her always delay-ish timing style (I don't know how to describe it ), but she always put something in each words.. Full of soul.
=
This episode of Queendom made me cry. Not just Mamamoo's but everyone's performance made me cry bcs of too much feels I cant handle.
=
Mamamoo never fail to amaze me !!! I will forever stan them.
=
Omg 
=
Some thoughts after watching this:
- MMM doesnt need flashy choreos to make a good performance, just their voices are more than enough.
- This song will probably be trending again.
- Loving the aesthetics here! Omg their clothes and makeup are just so perfect. And of course each member has gotten so much more beautiful now that they've found their right style. Esp Wheein omg  dont know why but whenever I see her on Queendom her visuals blow me away, she looks like Miss Korea or sth.
=
LITERAL QUEEENNNSSS
=
Wheein I love you
=
Solaaaaarrrr  perfect 
=
idle performance was awesome but mamamoo give me goosebump on the back of my head with their voice T.T
=
Who's still crying while replay this?
=
Mamamoo doesn't even do queendom to win, they just wanted to put up some amazing stages for their fans to enjoy and not to be dramatic but mamamoo's genuine love for moos make me so emo. I just love them so much 
=
輝いていてそして美しいmamamooが大好き
=
I dunno anymore if this beautiful 100% live vocal performance get beaten by a lipsyncing performance  its ok mmm u already won our hearts
=
Hope someone reupload the subs with the lyrics huhuhu
=
 I miss you
=
So clean i'm inlove.
=

Feels like their performance is not a competition, but a stage for MooMoo
=
Wait...why am I crying?

Moonbyul is so beautiful tho
=

=
Whoever put this 4 crazy power house vocalist in one group is truly genius. ^^/ I'm a proud moomoo!! And I'm glad that no hate/critic they receive on this stage :'') you can't hate this undenying power vocal stage^^
=
Just came across this video and not even a fan of Mamamoo, but tbh i shed some tears!! This was so beautiful and emotional. They're all vocal queens. Thank god i didn't skip this video
=
I cried like a baby!!! They were the only ones that truly captured the thankful vibes and love for fans (fight me on that).
I started liking kpop because I loved how kpop groups were so thankful for their fans, most of the western music doesn't even thank the fans, but kpop always does.
I love you mamamoo❤️
=
why i heared "mana suaranyaaaa" at the first..
=
Wow ❤
=
Please show alot a love to our girls. They work so hard
=
So beautiful ladies.
=
I'm sorry for everyone but today I'm only biasing on wheein!! 
Y'all this was filmed when she was still sick(I hope she's doing better) and she gave THIS! THIS!!! seriously what kind of talend is this. Her voice is unique. High, low notes. She can do it all  ❤ and on top of that, she's gorgeous. 
Mamamoo keep reminding me why I stan them.
=
best group has kpop to offer!
=
I don't understand but i feel, then i cry
=
i cant understand but i just cried : ((((((((((((
=
update: I can't stop replaying this
update 2: finished watching the show and still coming back to this and their final song destiny
just wanted to add that people might think that it was unfair that mamamoo was on the show in the first place since they already have a big fanbase but i'm thankful for this show anyways since i fell in love with the other groups. wouldn't have watched this if mamamoo wasn't in it also so like
=
❤❤❤
=
best live ever
=
I’m in tears
=
MAMAMOO I LOVE YOU 
=
This is undeniable talent right here

=

I love you mamamoo❤
=

=
PERFEITOOOOOO
=
Mamamoo is a blessing to this world
=
what's the benefit they get in QUEENDOM QUEST?
=
Their vocals is beyond reality
=
i am the woman at 4:35 while listening to their angelic voices
=
Can you guys saw how they really improved from their performance before? Queens of getting better and better everyday.
=
I feel the saddest ...
=
Crying again 
=
wheein's vocal oh my god
=
Who's crying? 
Yes, I am
=
As a fan. I can't contain myself for not crying because they are my source of inspiration to strive harder to fight the unpredictable life battle we faced everyday. That's this performance strike to me to all the hard works they did in able for them to be recognize and behind all of that efforts they still include to that performance all their fans who believed and support them till the end. I love MAMAMOO.
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
VOCAL QUEENS
=
BeLisMamamo (Believe and listen mamamo) :)
=
Hwasa te amo!
=
Se me erizo la piel! Hermosa canción! Mamamoo mi grupo preferido
=
assistindo de novo pq essa música não sai da minha cabeça
=
Im proud to be a moomoo
=
Please let vote for Hwasa and mamamoo on mama awards they work so hard without resting
=
Its make me touched
=
The best song forever
=
Why are you so cute? 2:40
=
And even that Queendom still try make them devil.
=
Wow look, Eng Sub! Thx
=
I initially wondered how they selected Byulie & Hwasa for the group challenge since I know Mamamoo is 4 vocals & 4 dancers. But now I know... LOL. A great strategy here. Moonbyul & Hwasa smashed the vocal & performance round. And then Solar & Wheein's vocals soared with "I Miss You". If the "Goodluck" performance highlighted their individual styles, this time, the game plan is the Rap Line & Angel Line tandem. 

Man, you really can't ignore Mamamoo. It's still a mystery to me how they individually shine but perform harmoniously on stage as well.
=
Jung Wheein best singer of our generation
=
They came here to perform , not competition
=
Honestly I had freaking goosebumps whenever Wheein opened her mouth like her voice is insane I’m crying 
=
Wheein’s voice is like“WOW”, so freaking stable and stunning.
=
Wheein's voice is too good
=
I’m crying even when I’m not a Moomoo
=
when they sing, they are the real queen
=
Who allowed you to make me cry like this
=
I kept replaying Wheein's part and their reactions 
=
Is this Mamamoo’s last perf in Queendom? Well if it is, we can all go home now... momoos will follow you Mamamoo.0
=
This is how unique they are. And I am more than proud of them.
=
WHEEIN
=
Minimum background music + Maximum thoughts and vocal performance from MAMAMOO.  
=
The Real MVP in Mamamoo's eye are Only Moomoo Queendom became their new Training ground. They're just practicing 
=
crying in momoo language, this is so beautiful :(((( <3
=
This performance just aims for the heart.
=
I cannot find words at how perfect this performence was. They truly just cared about a great performence that's just very them and one for the fans. It was just PERFECTION.
=
Oh.my.goodness.. felt like im floating.. Eargasm at its finest  MAMAMOO I LOVE YOU
=
this is my first time I got goosebumps for a whole performance
=
Mamamoo slaying the stage with pure vocals. Made me forget the previous group even performed
=
Each and every stage performance makes me go 'WOW'
=
this performance is cleansing my soul✨
=
Vocal Queens ❤️
=
I cried so muchqueens we love youuuu❤️
=
Oh my god!!! They love us the way we love them!!!!!
=
Finally, Wheein!!!
=
Excelente 
Fue la primera canción que me hizo llorar 
=
Their VOICE is awesome!!!
MAMAMOO Daebak !!!
=
They never fail to give me goosebumps!!!! 
=
moonbyul makes me gay for wearing that dress aAaAaah
=
We missed you too, mamamoo!! Fighting!!!!
=
Mamamoo did that 
=
This performance are another level ❤
=
When BTS reproduce their song for Army, and I remember this, I miss you for momos
=
I love mamamoo forever♥️
=
love mamamoo forever!!
=
THANK YOU SO MUCH for being mama moo!
=
i freaking love mamamoo
=
Omg!! M crying n i dnt why...
=
What i love about Queensdom, is it's forcing all the artists to bring their A game, and even have to improve on that in the next episode, then next episodes, performances just get better and better. 
That being said, once you reach certain height, I don't think season 2 / new groups joined, they can meet the expectation anymore
=
okay but look at how much Hwasa has grown as a vocalist. so proud of her❣️.
=
So much I miss you 
=
English translation of lyrics (not mine, cr: colorcodedlyrics.com)
When I look at the evening sunset,
So much I miss you
On days where the wind feels so good,
I… you you you you
When I hear a good song,
So much I miss you
When I watch a good movie, I think of you
I… you you you you
Days that I shared with you
Are not here anymore
On starry nights, always,
(So much~) So much I miss you
When tears silently fall,
I…you you you you (No, no)
Your voice,
So much I miss you
Yesterday and today,
I…you you you you
Your touch that caressed me,
So much I miss you
You used to whine that you missed me
I…you you you you (No, no)
Days that I shared with you
Are not here anymore
On starry nights, always,
(So much~) So much I miss you
When tears silently fall,
I…you you you you (No, no, no)
Your voice,
So much I miss you (So I miss you)
Yesterday and today,
I…you you you you (No, no)
These days, I sleep with tissues instead of you
My phone playlist is filled with sad songs
Because I feel like they’ll
Comfort me like this song
But I miss you
(Traces of you remain in my room,
Covered in tears)
Everyone goes through a breakup
But why am I acting like this?
I’m even worse today
Your whispers, your touch
They’re not here anymore
But I only have you
I miss you
On starry nights, always,
So much I miss you (I miss you)
When tears silently fall,
I…you you you you (I…you you you, No)
Your voice,
So much I miss you (I miss you)
Yesterday and today,
I…you you you you (Oh no, no)
On starry nights, always, (Always oh~)
So much I miss you
(So much I miss you~)
When tears silently fall, (Fall)
I…you you you you (You~)
Whenever (Whenever) Wherever
(Wherever, I miss) (I miss you)
So much I miss you
Whenever Wherever
(I miss you So much)
I…you you you you (Mmm~)
(No No No)
So much I miss you
I….you you you you
=
Beautiful voice, true queen ❣️

If you want 1st
⬇️
=
Waaa!! 
=
Wow! I almost cried.
=
Mnet: How many fans do you wanna make cry? 
Mamamoo: Yes
=
Perfekto!
=
ชั้นจะไม่หนีไปด้อมอื่น ชั้นรักคุณ
=
what competition? they’re just here to spend more time with moomoos
=
*"MAMAMOO never give out a bad performance."*

 That's not a compliment.

*It's a fact.*
=
Mamamoo's 'Melting' album was such a gem.
=
They really gave a performance that fitted the theme 'Fandora', they changed their lyrics to express their love and gratitude to moomoos for supporting them and giving them unconditional support. You can see how much they love their fans and prepare a stage where they can truely express what they wanted, what they truely feel all this time. They knew without moomoo, they are nothing and without mamamoo, we are nothing. This song, the video they prepared and the emotions they delivered are just indescribable. I really love this theme, it was an eye opener to all of us, moomoo cause we really know that we love each other. Let's walk on flower path only MAMAMOO ❤️
=
Wheein vocals really shined
=
Wheein and Solar omigod they carried this song to the finish line... Almost makes up for them not being in the last challenge. Mamamoo 
=
wheein's voice is so angelic. how did she do this so effortlessly..
=
wheein really has beutiful voice, and great technique. she's definetely one of the best singer in korea.
=
They are so powerful.  One of kinds, like no other girls band like them. And Moonbyul part made me cry so hard.....T.T
=
Why others saying that they are in their comfort zone as far as i remember since debut they don't perform in a box they usually do what they want and love. Doing new things or concept for them is not new. They almost tried everything you will know what i mean if you watch Immortal Songs of them, comebacks,or even their song in albums. I dare to say that they are the most diverse GG i've ever known in KPOP. Judging them with what they can do base on 3 performance is not really fair. Your amaze with other groups since they usually perform the same or similar concept  over the years they are active. Showcasing Mamamoo's vocal in this performance is the best they can do since they become popular because of this. And the concept is for their fans. Their vocal level can even be compared with the great vocalist in Korea.
=
Wheein pumped up that vocaLs. You're also a very good dancer
=
I’m crying like a baby I love mamamoo so much im so glad I found them when I did
=
Solar's Voice and High notes is life  Queens 
=
Everypart of this performace is such a heartbreak and heart warming❤this kind of girl group deserve a world tour and great albums. They deserve everything they can possibly have. 
: New MooMoo here❤
=
Goosebumps all over!!! ❤❤❤ I love all Mamamoo members, they're my queens!!! But Wheein's voice is just ughhh so enchantingly beautiful. It's silky, soft, soothing and ethereal. I don't know how to explain it coz it's so beautiful.  Love youuuu mamamamamoooo❤
=
I'm crying and having goosebumps at the same time falling in love  with them all over again      #mamamoo #moomoo
=
God bless the person who put this 4 amazing girls in one group ❤
=
My heart is aching why? 
=
love the way Yuqi compliments other in Queendom❤️
=
They f*cking blessed my ears  Amen my angels 
=
They are artists, amazing vocals and art  
Amo tanto a Mamamoo, no puedo dejar de llorar, no merecemos su amor... Ot4 nunca dejen de sonreír, no dejen que los haters les afecten, hay personas que las amamos demasiado.
=
I've never felt this emotional to a song other than that of 2ne1's live performance of It Hurts. OMG! They're a superb group!  
=
I really love them! Every time I hear this song I end up crying! It's so touching!
=
This is moree like a concert
=
The vocals made me love this song first listen
=
Am gonna cry like a river if 2ne1 gonna do this too. Oh my. I feel like am crying. 
Good job Mamamoo. 
=
Touching  
Mamamoo❤️
Love from Malaysia's Fan
=
I wish they include eng sub for the song too
=
I just can't stop watching this..
=
Another proof that you won't be able to pick a bias among them coz they're all amazing. This is sooooo lit and emotional ♥️
=
❤️❤️❤️ i love their vocals
=
I am crying  I
=
Str3am moomoo!!! Vamos atrás en las reproducciones... we can do it!!

=
I don't know why.... but I'm crying... I even don't understand the lyrics... this was beautiful
=
Adoro el rostro genuinamente sorprendido de Yuqui
=
Mamamo is good and you all so is the best... amezing you know.... woowowowowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
=
they are not singing for 1st first place or for mnet 
they are singing for us MOOMOO ❤️
=
Wheein and hwasa vocal is no joke..... Fellll in love their voice
=
They better win this whole damn thing!!! Theyre the only ones who can perform with live vocals plus choreography plus adlibs plus interacting with the audience. They dont just perform or do shows. They're always making a concert!!!
=
The W in wheein's name is WOW!
=
Mamamoo is a top contender to win queendom...but even if they don’t..
This performance will be talked for a very long time..it’s a worthy craft carefully created with love , passion, dedication & empathy...
I’m crying not even reaching the half of this magneficient performance 
=
Best Vocals among all girl groups in Kpop history,
=

Mamamoo strike me to the heart and emotion with their voice.
Edit : the goosbump start from solar start slayin in high note
=
holyshit i'm crying so damn much this song has a beautiful meaning and their voice killed me❤
=
Was having a really hard day and I just broke down watching this performance. Thank you Mamamoo ❤️
=
5:35 wheeinnnn so beautifulll 
=
One of my favorite Mamamoo songs ever! Absolutely brilliant performance. Everyone sounded wonderful. I'm so happy they didn't cut Wheein's first chorus like they usually do (grr) because it's one of the best parts of the whole song. Wheein's clear voice and vocal control are stunning and gives the song a soft start before it builds in tempo and volume.
=
I'm crying.. I can't believe they get this far and never forgetting how they all started. It's heartwarming to watch this performance.  I'm always and forever will be a moomoo!
=
wheein takes my breathe away !!! actually they all do 
=
that rap lyrics
=
This is so good that I keep coming back to watch it again and again
=
Can we just take time to appreciate these Queens ❤️
=
Damn I teared up. We are ready for a comeback now.
=
BEST STAGE IN MY HEART ❤️
=
Love their voice so much ❤️
=
Omg I'm crying 
=
You can feel so much love in their performance. It literally gave me goosebumps!
=
Mamamoo's is my fav gg. I had goosebumps listening to it. Wheein, solar, hwasa are beat vocalist in kpop and moonbyul, one of the best gg rapper. We love you mamamoo. Keep shining and growing
=
Wheein aaa my baby ❤❤❤
=
I’m literally crying my tears out its too beautiful i love them so much
=
This is so beautiful 
=
That's our Mamamoo <3
=
I love their outfit.
=
Mamamoos in this for the fans, not the competition 
=
I love you mamamoo. I lost count of reasons of why i am a fan
=
Mamamoo really deserves the whole world, listening to this made me feel loved, I really can't understand the lyrics but I felt that, the love the emotions.
They mean the world to me.
=
I CRIED I CRIED
=
A sis has been missing out on this TALENT 
=
0T4 forever❤
=
I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I'm just so lucky I stan the right group for me!
=
Im lit crying noww
=
#MAMAMOO ❤️❤️❤️
=
mamamoo’s perfs in queendom so far:
Decalcomanie - showcased their strong girl crush vibes
Good Luck cover - emphasized their strengths as individual artists
I Miss You - proved how they are really vocal queens & their deep love for moomoos
This is how MMM show versatility.
=
Seeing park boms face was like ☹️
=
Daebak. Love you so much mamamoo i from indonesia. I proud of you guys
=
I wouldn't care about the rankings for this round because Mamamoo's performance already won in every Moomoo's hearts 
=
WTF MAMAMOO MY YEART FOR YALL ARE SO BIG LIKE I LITERALLY CRIED WTFF
=
Can they please upload this version on Spotify??
=
I have lost count on how many times I watched this but it never fails to make me tear up even just a little bit. MAMAMOO is the only girl group that I can really feel their sincerity and passion and touched my heart ❤
=
This talent should not be kept only to Korea, the whole world needs to know this.
=
Mamamoo really joined Queendom just for their fans. Bless their beautiful hearts ❤️
=
these group doesn’t deserve queendom. they’re already the queenss. duhhh
=
DID I JUST SEE A GHOST IN 1:23 , 2:18 , 3:48 , 4:29 , 4:48 , 5:05
=
Sigo viendo este video y vuelvo a llorar. #THANKYOUMAMAMOO ❤❤
=
I was crying and really into it but then hwasa's voice cracked and i cracked out 
=
They are so good that it's sounds fake
=
Park bom must be remembering the moment with her girls in their trainee years .
=
JUNG WHEEIN WHY ARE YOU SO PERFECT?
=
No wonder the other group are looking up to them. They've earned respect right from the start. They are a real Artists.
=
Wheein’s voice is really best! I like it!!!
=
BRUH WHEEINS VOCALS IS —

=
I became a moomoo just recently, 1-2 years ago, and I cry like a child watching this :"))
=
The emotion they showed just by using their voices gave me goosebumps. The part where they kept mentioning moo moos in the VCR made me want to cry 
=
My heart ❤❤
=
Why am I crying while watching this?
I’ve always been proud of my girls, Mamamoo and will always be a proud and happy MooMoo. I’ve listened to and watched a lot of their performances but all of a sudden I just started crying half way through this... 
I really love you Mamamoo and please keep being who you are ❤️
=
Hwasa’s note at like 4:58 ish was just wow
=
this is so beautiful ya'll :'c
=
They even change the lyrics and byul wrote the rap part. OMG I cried buckets everytime I watched this. I love u so much Mamamoo
=
I'm happy for them.. Every week they show us different genres and style.  Belismoo 
=
Whooaaahhh,  as expected from my Queens.  But Wheeinie really did a great job in this.  Saranghae Mamamoo
=
I cried so hard... love my girls so much 
=
This song  always in my heart.
=

BUT I DO CARE,  when people say they aren't giving their best and that they are horrible, when people say they don't deserve it.
=
Rainhas

=
I was already crying before the song started because knowing it's for us just made me cry  ❤
=
MAMAMOO DID THAT!!!!!!!!!
=
This is insane!!! Real talent, real artists. Who am I? I got lost!!!! It's cuz their voices come from heaven. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=

=
Pinche stage más precioso y emotivo  No tengo ni idea de qué va el programa pero ustedes ganan  lo máximo 
=

=
PERFEITAS RAINHAS ACLAMADAS CONTEM COMIGO PARA TUDO
=
Lpm casi me hacen llorar ;; COMO PUEDEN SER TAN PERFECTAS DIOS
=
THEY ARE THE QUEEN OF VOCAL
=
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
Who’s cutting onions next to me
=
❤❤❤
=
I just noticed how the harmonised part of "no no no no no" and "so much I miss you" is kind of thin and weak compared to the one when they performed in music bank shows and that's because they sing.this.song.in.total.live without any single prerecorded vocal even in the harmonisation part damn
=
I’m not crying, you’re not crying.
Who are we kidding? My heart literally melted
=
We don't need 1000 of reasons to love them. Look at them they don't deserve any hate
=
MAMAMOO DID GREAT 
=
Idk how many times i watch this
=
Solar your voice so amazingg
=
❤
=
This really sound like they going to break up and this is their last song. I hope I'm wrong.
=
Hope they got the first place this week
=
everyone is talking about wheein and her voice and she’s amazing and all, but why aren’t we talking about the video they showed the crowd before byul started rapping. That literally made me cry so hard, cause it showed how thankful they are to their fans. We love you MAMAMOO <3
=
made me cry so much uhuhuhuhuh
=
=
Their voices
=
I love voice ♥️♥️♥️

I've always loved this song the most because wheein's voice shines so much all throughout it.
=
I hate it how this girls make me fall for them every time they open their mouth.Like really stop it,it's not funny anymore
=
This is my first time ever I'm crying cause of someone's singing.
=
Anybody: Solar can't sing
Solar:
=
Legit goosebumps when I hear Wheein and Solar's runs in this song. I'm a fairly new MooMoo and didn't know about this song. I legit started tearing up when I realized Moonbyul changed the rap and the new lyrics are so beautiful. Thanks for the Eng Subs Mnet!
=
Their voices, moonbyul's rap, the song = me cried
=
We surely can feel the sincerity of them thru this perf. And mygad! WheeIn goes off here. I missed her during the last eps cuz shes not present most of the times but boy i got my heart racing watching this. Truly blessed to have listened and watched these talented and gorgeous artist perform
=

=
I am so happy I discovered Mamamoo
=
I remember falling in love with this song when I bought all the digital albums! So glad to see them perform it live. Clearly they ate CDs before this!! XD

When I look at the evening sunset,
so much I miss you
On days where the wind feels so good, I…
you you you you
When I hear a good song,
so much I miss you
When I watch a good movie,
I think of you
 
Days that I shared with you are
not here anymore
 
On starry nights, always,
so much I miss you
When tears silently fall, I…
you you you you
Your voice,
so much I miss you
Yesterday and today, I…
you you you you
 
Your touch that caressed me,
so much I miss you
You used to whine that
you missed me
 
Days that I shared with you are
not here anymore
 
On starry nights, always,
so much I miss you
When tears silently fall, I…
you you you you
Your voice,
so much I miss you
Yesterday and today, I…
you you you you
 
These days, I sleep with tissues instead of you
My phone playlist
is filled with sad songs
Because I feel like they’ll comfort me like this song But I miss you
Traces of you remain in my room,
covered in tears
Everyone goes through a breakup
but why am I acting like this?
I’m even worse today
 
Your whispers, your touch
They’re not here anymore
But I only have you
I miss you
 
On starry nights, always,
so much I miss you
When tears silently fall, I…
you you you you
Your voice,
so much I miss you
Yesterday and today, I…
you you you you
 
On starry nights, always,
so much I miss you
(So much I miss you~)
When tears silently fall,
I…you you you you
 
Whenever Wherever
(Wherever, I miss) (I miss you)
So much I miss you
Whenever Wherever
I miss you So much
I…you you you you
No No No
 
So much I miss you
I….you you you you
=
Wheein doesn't even have to try to kill me with her voice. An effortless goddess
=
wheein's runs are giving me so much life rn omg
=
Imagine Mamamoo performing this in MAMA and other big stage showsssaa
=
Solar's growl gave me chills

I want to cry but I can’t 
=
Keep streaming guys. This perf needs million views. ❤️
=
Maravilhosas 
=
Wheein ..... Solar...
=
#MAMAMOO ❤️❤️❤️
=
aww mmm changed some parts of the lyrics  they made a fan song ver 
=
You really cant top mamamoo, theyre always the best
=
Just like the ending stage in a concert, mamamoo really love their moomoo
=
Gurlll....I cried
=
Let me shout I LOVE MAMAMOO 
=
Mijoo is literally me.
=
I can easily say that they are one of the best singers / artists IN THE WORLD! .
=
I'm crying. Who else??? So much feeling on this song.
=
padahal kaga ngerti bahasanya tapi ko mewek ya gue aneh , magis emg musik tuh
=
They deserve the name of "the waking CDs".
They sing in live even better than the recorded one.
=
The best thing? It felt like they didnt just do it to win, they did it, for the fans, always the fans. Achievement of the year = getting into MOOMOO T_T
=
the fact that make me crying is : Mamamoo can do more than this if they want everyone to like their stage. but no, Mamamoo do what Moomoo like. Mamamoo singing for Moomoo, this stage completely for Moomoo. not for winning this Variety. ♡
=
I'm so proud of my babies no matter what the result is from Msnake. The way they changed the lyrics for us Moomoos got me teared up
=
Keren banget....
=
=
Queeeeeeee increíble participación de mamamo... Aunque no me debería de sorprender tanto ellas son maravillosas y se dieron la oportunidad de agradecer a sus fans por medio de este número y claro recordando sus inicios...
=
So much emotion 
=
i got literal goosebumps holy shit
=
Superb vocal, delivered beautifully.
=
01:43
=
wheeins breathy voice is angelic
=
Wheein's voice.... carries SO MUCH EMOTIONS, like Jungkey says, its truly a voice that transcends time and locations
=
Mamamoo isn’t on the stage to gain views. Instead, they gain respect.
=
They really show off their vocals here. This is the true power of mamamoo
=
Wheen's voice can melt everyone...
=
Mamamoo = Queens of vocals
=
Wheein's voice is so so so soft...
I repeat watch it again and again
=
The moment whee in start singing i'm melting. Her voice killing me 
=
Solar's voice~omg~~~I love it.
Solar:best singer T.T
=
Wheein's voice  cure sadness inside my soul❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
How i wish they will win 1st in this first season.They deserve it. I still remember when people don't recognize they talents before because people more focus with idols with beautiful visual. We must appreciate idols like them. FOR ME they not idols anymore they are legends and on another level thats why i become they fan since 2017 coz talents more important than look. Btw, they are beautiful also and have their own charms.
=
I didnt expect that i will cry. Esp moonbyul's rap part 
=
Honestly I am streaming this because i want my girls to win, help me or lemme do it myself irdk
=
Wheein its a really really AMAZING !!!!
=
omg wheein at 4:48 that run thoughhhh
=
Moonbyul so good, she can touch every people heart with her lyrics ❤
=
AS A MOOMOO, IVE NEVER BEEN SO EMOTIONAL AND SO PROUD OF THEMMMMM  i mean no need to be flashy and sparkly, just being pure and full of talent...they deserve more. They deserve MILLIONS of fans screaming for them
=
WHOAAAAAAH IT'S TOO INCREDIBLE! LOVE U SO MUCH
=
Moomoo, we’ve gone through so much with Mamamoo right? I cried so hard damn...
=
I just love them. Been watching this a ton of of times but i still get gooosebumps MAMAMOOO YOU DESRVE THE WORLD
=
I love the way moonbyul unni raps her technique is just love 
=
MAMAMOO's performance dont need back up dancers, backtracks/auto tunes or anything else. MAMAMOO itself is more than enough to have a great performance. Its too much to handle.
=
Notice how Mamamoo never put weird things on their face to perform, just pure talent and elegance
=
I think Seunghee's expression at 4:33 is all of us right now
=
I love how they reminisce the past, they truly love MOOMOOS
=
All of their performances felt like a concert. I can't stop loving them so much! Thank you for existing Mamamoo 
=
Goddd. I got goosebumps all throughout the performance. Guess what?! that's Mamamoo's charm.
=
thank you mamamoo for being in my life and this I will never forget
=
oh they're on their concert
=
I'm not an emotional person but this got me crying!! I just love mamamoo so much ❤️ they deserve all the love that we moomoos give!
=
I'm a crying mess of furball. this is so great awesome beyond and over....
=
I CANT BELIEVE THEY SANG THIS AGAIN OMG! This is my favorite song
=
Watch over and over 
Love for u guys are never ending
=
I wanna cry watching this 
=
Thank you Mamamoo❤️
=
I am so proud to be a moomoo I am English and don’t know much Korean but this still made me cry 
=
Its not the first time i cried when hearing them perform but i always am shocked whenever i let down a tear  
what rank they get this episode wont matter since they have won all of our heart,but im 100% positive that they wont get the last 3rd place [and down]
=
Kerennn parah ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
still got goosebumps!
=
I’m a 31-year old crying Moomoo 
=
邊看邊聽邊哭
=
I love them... Be strong hwasa bout what just happen.. I just want to see them happy. and if people hate u.. please let it be. U r deserve to be love from people love u..... I'm tearing. Just think about sulli.. I just don't want mamamoo feel alone .. 
=
Am I the only one crying the whole video?
=
every "moomoo" coming out from their mouth makes me so proud that I am one of those "moomoo" 
=
Only love MAMAMOO
=
Their voice is killing me omo..
=
Who is here crying right now?
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
At the end you can hear Moonbyul’s low harmonies really well 
=
When the intro of the song started I got goosebumps already.
=
Reminds me of 200 lbs of beauty quote:
“What’s our concept? 
Singing.”
=
Everyone in emotion shock because of wheein voice is a whole mood
=
Thanks Mamamoo....
=
I'm crying
=
❤
=
❤
=
Who else cried watching this!
=
amazing voice
=
❤️
=
mamamoo is the best !
=
=
4 diva
=
they won our hearts and that’s enough
=
Who is crying? Hands up ✋
=
I'm not a moomoo but I'm crying so hard. They did this performance for their fans and that's amazing.
=
MAMAMOO: What is a backtrack??
=
I don’t know when i start crying:” but its really good and we all know this song is for moomoos it’s really touching 
Love you MAMAMOO<3
=
Moonbyul's rap brings down ma tears. Moomoos are so lucky.
=
I love how mamamoo just do their best on every performance and doesn't really care about ranking.Especially in this 3rd preliminary.Mamamoo figthing!! I love this song glad to see them perform this song again after a long time.
=
I'm crying in the middle of the cafe
=
OMG WHEIN❤️
=
Wheein's voice is my favorite ❤❤❤ always my favorite!!
=
Stan a group that can Stan you back!
=
Wheein your voice is incredible ❤❤❤sooo much love for you and mamamoo
=
Wheein’s voice is just so 
=
I am not really into KPop but these girls are really something ~ vocals on fleek  Mamamoo is worth stanning for  I am now a MooMoo 
=
Omg I'm so moved by they sincerity...We will be always here to support them, the Mamamoo; and they'll always be there for each other too I guess:)
=
they're too good....damn
=
i never would’ve thought we’d still get another performance of this song ever since their performance last 3 years ago,  still beautiful and flawless as always
=
can we appreciate Moon byul's low notes like ghaaaadd 
=
I've watched this video like 10 ten times already and I cry everytime 
You can really feel their love for us moomoos, how lucky are we??
❤Mamamoo❤
=
0:29 a beauty. Such a beauty.
=
Oh fudge! I'm crying! Moomoos y'all are so lucky and blessed stanning these Queens. Their voices are so powerful but gentle and soothing. I love this performance so much! 
=
Vocals on point and byul's rap wrecked me so hard 
=
After I watched this I cried and it touched my heart so damn much. I love the other groups but mamamoo stage present itself has deeply moved me man that when I watch the others mamamoo effects are still attached with me. That shows just how much they have the effect on people as if the song itself had embrace me with so much warmth huhuhuhu 
=
What genre do you want? 
Mamamoo : yes
Mamamoo eat them all
=
Now why i love them 
=
Semua vocalnya bagus bagus
SNSD,REDVELVET,GUGUDAN,MAMAMOO
Kesukaan enyong
=
My ears has been blessed
=
I'm proud i stan them.. love you all.
=
Wheein’s voice is aksjajajaj cannot describe it
=
Not a Moomoo but tbh? I cried so hard?? What is going on 
=

=
Thank you mamamoo for making me cry
=
歌が上手すぎる！！
=
❣️❣️❣️ my heart is just melted , unlimited love to MAMAMOO , LOVE U!! FROM MOOMOO
=
wheein..... i have no words
=
For me, this is their best vocal performance since their debut  FOREVER MOOMOO 
=
❤❤❤❤
=
Legend 
=
I’m not their fan but i fall in Love with Wheein’s voice
=
MOOMOO SORI CHILLOOOOOOO
anyone crying like me?
=
I love how they each have their own unique and different sound but can blend so beautifully well together  as if they were meant to be
=
Gosh can’t wait for them to sing this on their concert tour. I hope I can watch them live. Please have a concert in the Philippines this 2020 ♥️
=
Wheein
=
wheein really brought out the emotions in this one
=
love this song!!!!!!!!!
=
Mamamoo really knows how to play this game. They're really creative for each performance that they had in this show, everything is new so refreshing.
=
Solar wonderfull
=
What voices they have!!!!
=
bat ang sakit? 
=
❤️❤️
=
MAMAMOO BEST VOCALISTS COME THRU
=
MAMAMOO SLAAAAAAAAYS AGAIN
=
i cried :/
=
gooddes✨
=
I'm crying
=
3:51 - 3:53 ???????
=
=
tangina pwede na tong OST ng kdrama
=
they did not even dance yet they slayed the whole stage
=
This video is exactly the reason why I said at the beginning of Queendom that this wasn't a fair competition
Mamamoo are truly in a league of their own ✨
=
Mamamoo is not here for the competition, they're here just to flex them vocals and make moomoo happy
=
I swear that no MOOMOO would not feel touched while watching this. Becoming a  MOOMOO is one of my proudest thing in my life.
=
Thinking that they are their own back up singers is so "making their mama proud"
=
Wheein voice is 
=
This is broke my heart in good way, so much love from Mamamoo for us. 
=
Wheeinie,  why you are so perfect ??
=
Mamamoo's vocal is just so fucking crazy!!!!! Specially Wheein's voice, it really stood out!! And if you think about it, their singing techniques really did improve a lot. It's much smoother now. They never disappoint.
=
THEY GAVE ME GOOSEBUMP, I LOVE THEIR VOICE FROM THE START I KNEW THEM ON PIANOMEN 

=
Las amo mucho. Sinceramente, me han hecho llorar. 
=
WHY ARE THEY SO PERFECT!
=
they are so beautiful
=
i cried omg ❤️
=
Moomoo or not, you can't deny the surge of emotions from this performance. I love you MAMAMOO 
=
Why am I crying? 
=
Hweein voice so wonderful 
=
Ahh I'm crying...they created new version of I Miss You for Moomoo's only...ahhh im so touched....
=
I crieeeeeeeed ❣️
=
We love you MAMAMOO. Love, strength, and happiness is sent your way across the globe ♥️
=
I AM CRYINGGGGG 
=
woooow! divas! their voices is soooo amazing love them
=
In love with everything in this video. Love you Mamamoo.
=
I'm crying guys huhuhuhu im so proud of you guys mamamoo
=
So meaningfull performance. So great MAMAMOO. so much love for this❤
=
This is myfavorite song of mamamoo 
=
Wheiiiiiinnnnnn onniiiii!!!!!
=
low key waiting for Moonbyul to sing Moon Movie on Queendom...
=
3:52 ... ? Beautiful song
=
I remember the first time I actually saw their "I miss you" performance.Their powerful voices surrounded the entire hall,but still sounded pure,genuine and really beautiful.If you're a true fan of them,you should grab a chance to go to see their concert. Anyway thank you very much,Mamamoo,for this amazing performance.
=
I'm really sorry it's so sad i listen to this after i see the news of SULLI  OMG 
=
I MISS YOU TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOÒOOOOOO
WOOOO HOOOOOOOO
=
This song is for me. I am a  MooMoo. Thank you 
=
Omg! Thank you Mamamoo! Moomoos love you so much!
=
They really make this performance a love song for moomoo,I love them so much
=
ヤバすぎるしマジで愛してる(号泣)(語彙力低下)(偏差値3)
=
Moomoos have it so easy. anytime there are fanwars going on about who's the best female vocal group in K-Pop they know they don't need to fight because they stay winning
=
omg i'm crying
=
Ooooooh this and THIS
=
goosebumps
=
Blackjack here but I love mamamoo.. ❤❤❤
=
VOCAL QUEENS
=
Goosebumps
=
邱挖❤️
=
That’s Mamamoo.
=
Just like jungkey said " wheein can hit the high notes with that honey voice"..
=
i love them so much
=
Oh gosh!!!! I am dying!!!!
=
This has no fancy choreography, no thrilling concept, no colorful stage. What it has (apart from amazing voices), is meaning. Maybe it won't appeal to non moomoos, maybe they won't see the greatness in it, but I guess that wasn't the point anyway. The song is for moomoos, for those who will see it as meaningful. In a way, most of Mamamoos performances in Queendom so far have been the same. Good Luck was a reference to the MMM concerts, Moonbyul's dance previewed a song fans knew she'd composed. Like Mamamoo is saying "I see you, I'm doing this for you". This made me realize that Mamamoo isn't there to get new fans. They're primarily there for fan service haha Really glad I'm a moomoo!
=
FETUS MAMAMOO MAKES ME EMO STOP IT IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE
=
I'm in love with their voices harmony
=
Ambyar atiku 
=
Nobody, but nobody in K Pop can put  so much emotion into their songs, and hold an audience entranced like Mamamoo can. Go for it ladies.
=
to the moomoo reading this: pls go drink some water. hydrate yourself. gotta replenish the tears you just shed.
=
wow, these vocals...
from another world, what place did they get for this performance
=
Came back here just to listen to this song again after watching the full episode. ❤️❤️❤️
PS: I love all the girls in this competition. ❤️❤️❤️
=
Mamamoo I love you !
=
No matter what their ranking is in this round, I think they have definitely won all of our hearts.
=
Mamamoo has been the realest,most humble to their fans,greatest vocal as a girl group in this generation no cap. This performance basically highlights everything you need to know about their vocals especially wheein getting all her lines and getting recognised. I’m crying 
=
♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
If you like mamamoo raise your hands
if you don't like mamamoo raise your standards
=
“they won because of popularity,”
how did they get popular? of course with the amount of talent they have, sweethearts, not lip syncing.
=
I can't even tell who's the main vocal, gosh the vocals
=
Them: Mamamoo don't deserve the win--
Moomoos: Being too busy with all the ratatata tatata tatatata tatata tatata uri kyeolguk dashi mannal unmyeongieotji
=
Mamamoo just forgot about the competition, they did everything for their fans, they performed every song like it was their concert. People enjoyed their performances and that's the only thing they wanted. They were like, "Scrue the competition, we love our fans more," and they won. 
They deserved it:)
=
“They won because they’re popular”
But like they got popular because of??? Talent love
=
is no one going to talk about moonbyuls visuals in this.
=
They really deserved the win they give off real singers energy
=
I can’t believe that Hwasa is so strong in this perfomance. Thats why she is a threat.
=
People who didn't think Mamamoo would win Queendom have obviously not seen Immortal Song
=
Lately in the community there has been a rise in the amount of toxic fans who try to throw disrespect on the names of established artists that have numbers in charts and results to back up their popularity. While at first it may not seem like Mamamoo is that big in comparison to other mainstream girl group idols because they have more yt views than we do, views at the end of the day isn't what will win awards and gain respect in the industry. Gogobebe already broke a lot of Mamamoo and other music records and they will continue to rise- Moo Moo's fanbase grows bigger and bigger every year and Mamamoo only gets better. It's also sad because back in the day no matter what, there was always an attitude in the kpop community that whether you stan them or not, you need to have respect to older established artists. That attitude unfortunately has seemed to stop for artists who came out around the time of Mamamoo, because there are always fans of groups who have existed for a minute who go around disrespecting their legacy like they haven't worked forever for what they have. I believe girl groups like BP, Gidle, etc will make their own amazing marks on music. They have been killing the scene as newer groups up until now. However, they are still new and are growing. A portion of their fans need to stop letting views and online popularity go to their heads and be respectful towards older established artists instead of dragging them like they haven't worked for years to build the legacy they have now.
=
Tonight I dreamed they had a MV for Destiny.  Hip is a masterpiece but I can't understand that they haven't promoted with Destiny since Queendom :(
=
trying to discredit their win by saying they are popular is pointless, how do you think they got popular? certainly not for their lipsyncing skills
=
Hopefully they can perform Destiny again in the rest award ceremonies of this year.
=
So they won the show with just a B-side track of their upcoming album? PERFORMANCE QUEENS
=
y'all complaining because mamamoo won is because of they're popular. where did they got their popularity? *from their talent dear*
=
Is no one gonna talk about how their new hairstyles suit them so much especially wheein and moonbyul
=
Mamamoo: *Autotune who? Never heard of her.*
=
ok for real their stage presence is UNMATCHED. they just exude confidence and power.... and DAMN THOSE VOCALS
=
no one:
absolutely no one:
moonbyul: kill us with that new hair and intense gaze
=
the only thing i hate about mamamoo's music is that it ends
=
I lost interest in Kpop 8 years ago. First group in 8 years to catch my attention
=
When people talk about MAMAMOO winning cause they are popular. You could say that, but in case you didn't know MAMAMOO started from the bottom. They once performed with only a few people and most of them were close friends and family of Mamamoo. So, yes maybe u could say that, but that POPULARITY your talking about is fairly gained by MAMAMOO themselves it didn't happened just in one clicked. They worked hard as hell and show people what they are capable even if they weren't the "idol image" people are used to. Furthermore, their fans, us moomoos especially kmoomoos. WOrk hard ass fuck. We promote hard, we vote hard and we show how much we love MAMAMOO even if we still aren't as big of a fandom as once, blinks or armys, we still manage to help promote our girls, like I even created a Instagram Mamamoo fan acc to support them. So rather than spreading hate, I am kindly asking you to SHOW AND SUPPORT YOUR FAV AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. CAUSE YOU SPREADING HATE DOESN'T HELP THEM WIN. Your wasting your time just hating and hating, when you could have been voting, streaming and supporting your idols hard af.
.
Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR The LIKES and Noticing this comment. Lets spread LOVE. "BLESS LIFE AND CARRY KNOWLEDGE"
=
I really respect how they sing live. Their vocal is not a joke. Four of them create a perfect harmonies when they sing.
=
"Set you freeee" Wheein- 2019
=
this is not a song, this is an anthem
=
We deserved a MV, please I want this song popular as this is a masterpiece
=
Use to play Imagine Dragon’s song to boost myself in the morning... now destiny helps me 
=
This isn't even an official comeback song yet it slayed more than that.
=
Such a wonderful performance! I was still wondering why this vid haven’t hit 10m views yet...
=
The song is a killer, these girls have a strong voice and they were probably a little too much for that stage.
=
I thought they where speaking a bit of German at the start. When they said “it’s been” I thought that said “Ich bin”. lmao I’m stupid but I can’t unhear it now....
=
I legit cried in Solar's part like I just love them so much. Take care of our girls
=
This is how many times you fell in love with MAMAMOO 
↓
↓
↓
=
MAMAMOO is a pure talent, stage presence and that charisma all in one. No one should dare to ask why again or to diss them why they won. TALENT!
=
i loved gidles song and perf but MMM deserved this win, they are unrivaled in talentry when it comes to girl groups. idgaf about sales, popularity, views all that bs, they won through pure talent and deserves every bit of this
=
choreographer: how many people do you wanna use as chairs?
mamamoo: yes
=
Their voices are their biggest weapons to conquer everything.
=
International moo moos waiting for world tour be like : i can wait forever 
=
Did I just witness a masterpiece?!?! Good Lord, this performance is flawless!
=
I just realized that in all Mamamoo live performances, they never had a grand stage as other groups had. I can only think of a piano, a pole, a chair and backup dancers?80% relies on their vocals and stage presence alone. And yet, they still managed to have one of (if not the) most energetic and impactful performances of any live shows.
TRUE QUEENS....
=
DONT LOOK AT WHEEIN’S EYES. IT’S A GRAVE MISTAKE. I’M UNDER HER SPELL NOW
=
Wheein's wholeass look left me speechless. Her best one yet.
=
people who comment that mamamoo don't deserve the win are probably tone deaf. srsly, if the standards for this contest is all about stage presence and elaborate stages, then i'd rather watch the victoria secret fashion show. please, mamamoo won this because of pure talent  that's why they are called "singers".
=
2:41 is my favvvv : DESTINY MAKES ME CRY, DESTINY MAKES ME SMILE
=
Why is Moonbyul such a girl crush
i cant
=
Any  moomoo whos happy Mamamoo won  ‍♀️
=
their stage presence just amazing making ma forehead cant chill
=
Finally, the most talented ones win
=
1st perf: Introduction song
2nd perf: Solo stages
3rd perf: Song for Moomoos
4th perf: Ending song
Lol Queendom is not a competition for Mamamoo. They just joined to have a looooong concert. 
=
i mean they even connected with the audiences too
=
Only mamamoo will engage with the audience in a competition XDD queens will always be queens
=
Who’s addicted to Wheein’s “set you free” ‍♀️
=
Mamamoo always makes sure that the audience is having fun,
=
At first i don't know why my daughter is so addicted to this group they're just a group of singers now i see why she like this group so much they have great vocal
=
They can sing. That's why mamamoo os different than all competitors
=
Mamamoo only need microphones as their props... and hyejin’s hat
=
they win because they have a talent
=
I hope they perform this at least t one award shows.
=
this is officially the coolest shit this 2019
=
I’m sure this would be such a memorable ending performance that everyone can enjoy. Put the competition aside, let’s just have fun and enjoy a wonderful performance!
=
DESTINY is just a b-side song from their 2nd full album and look what they have achieved with it. Cant wait for their title song HIP next week!
=
2:10
Mamamoo : Uri gyeolgok dashi manna unmyeongiosshi
Me : *uridkgjsnffjxsjfkfkdjffdjfkfyosshi*
=
Their love to us moo moo make them win.. They always mention our moo moo instead of our fan.. And never forget to mention moo moo in their speech..
My fav word:
"Uri moo moo deul"
=
3:55 this what a performance is 
THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE GREAT AND MEMORABLE PERFORMANCE.
They always involve the audience in their performances that why everyone remembers and loves them.
Audiences Hype them up and they do the same.
=
Now I know why they won. This was the last video I watched. Their artistry, power, and charisma is off the roof. They are not just idols, they're performers. It doesn't need any extravagant background, their voices makes the stage. They are so powerful internally, you can see it in their eyes. They are here to win. They deserved it. :)
=
I really admires singers who can dance while holding mics cause I know it’s hard holding something in the hand while dancing is just not natural
=
I swear to god they’re the best at engaging with the audience this is one of the reason why i love them soo much
=
They don't eat Cd. 
They eat the entire studios. 
Even their Live perf sounds better than studio version.
REAL QUEEN PERIOD.
=
oh no Solar 3:01 got scared for a second there
=
Some people will say Mamamoo won because they have a big fandom. Some will say they won because Mnet messed up with the votes. But anyone who gives this performance an unbiased look can see it's absolutely awesome. The final round had many great (really great) performances, it's not like Mamamoo was way above all the others, but they had a full package (sass, choreo, vocals and the featuring of the audience), so if they won, it's because they definitely deserved it.
EDIT. Wow. Didn't realize this comment was going to bring all this. To all the moomoos, just stop paying attention to the haters. They don't deserve it, and it's not like you're going to change anyone's mind. It's like talking to a wall, and it brings a whole bunch of negativity. Let's just focus on the positive, that is, Mamamoo's win, and the talent and hard work we KNOW they put forward. To those who say Mamamoo robbed 1st place and didn't deserve it, I'm sorry your faves have such immature, disrespectul fans, but it's not my mission in life to fix people. Go your own way.
=
Quuen Hwasa everyone✨
=
3:12
I see nobody talking about solar's deep voice, holy crap, that hidden talent is so underrated
=
I always get watery eyes while watching their live performances, they're just so powerful :D
=
Haters or unreasonable people: MMM can't dance
Yes they can and they're really good at it. They know what kind of dance suit their song best so they can bring out LIVE singing without getting out of breath while dancing. I love their freedom on stage, how they interact with fans while singing.
EDIT: THEY'RE NOT USING HAND MIC FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THEIR COMEBACK "HIP" AND STILL HAVE STABLE VOCALS, TAKE THAT HATERS!!
=
at 4:08 you can see's hwasa's gorgeous smile; you can tell that she's actually enjoying the stage so much
=
I was battling with my brain for so long and didn't watch the final performance until now of Mamamoo and G-Idle when I found out that why didn't G-idle win? Like why? But after watching this performance, if I were part of the judging too, I love G-idle I do, they're my bias but, Mamamoo, YOU ARE THE QUEEN. I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE ANYMORE.

Ps. Don't use the "they are famous" line for their win, well, gotta ask yourself why they're famous in the first place, and try to rewatch EVERY final performances of all contestants, you need light and Mamamoo wore white for ya'll to see.
=
Always give me goosebumps everytime I watch
=
i have goosebumps EVERY time i listen to this
real vocal queens 
=
OMG YOU GUYS SO COOL, I'M CRYING RN, SORRY FOR LATE EONNIES CUZ I HAVE EXAM 1 WEEK AGO NO MATTER WHAT I ALWAYS LOVE YOU ARE AND CONGRATULATIONS FOR WINNING THE COMPETITION!!! LUVLUV✨
=
THE VOCALS DAMN!!  STAN TALENT STAN MAMAMOO!!!
=
Bruh Mamamoo made it their own concert
=
I think the one thing that I truly love and appreciate about Mamamoo is their attitude. You can see the dedication they have for their artistry and music as well as their fans who are there for the same thing. Their vocals are always on point, they're great dancers and their stage presence is always top notch. Not a single one of them is lacking. On top of that instead of doing the weak one song come back Mamamoo comes back with an album. It is truly satisfying as a fan to be able to listen to more than one or two songs. It is always disappointing having to wait so long for another comeback/song with other groups. It is very easy to lose interest in a group that way. Mamamoo should be an example to others of what will work long term. With the way that they are doing things I can see them remaining and striving in the industry for a very long time.
=
They are singers. Performer. Dancing is just for them to round the whole thing up. 
I hope they perform this on MAMA. This song is made to be performed on a big stage with a crowd singing along.
EDIT: hello ladies and gents. thanks for the likes. i'm taking this as 1900+ people agree with me. cool.
i just watched everyone else's performance and i would like to add something:
I'm staying by what i said. i guess the only one from the other groups who could have compete with mamamoo was g-idle. they had a great set design and theme and the main point of the song was very fitting for the show. they also had some good vocals moment here and there.
however, even now after watching the others, i'm not surprised mamamoo won. 
if you compare the other groups and these two, the others were (noticeable) weaker. and i'm not talking specifically about vocals or dance or whatever, i'm talking about their performance as a whole.
g-idle did a great show. the dancers, the thrones. 
mamamoo just had their dancers and incorporated the audience. no extra props. a little bit of background changes on the screen behind them. and well the camera but i don't it did a lot for the performance. 
they did less show off and just performed as they usually do. 
queens comeback is nov 14th.
=
Mamamoo deserves a world tour.
=
Mamamoo is a proof that idols don't need a super duper very fantastic stage with a lot of lighting and stories and acting to have a good stage. They are the proof that talent doesn't choose good or bad stages. They were so far the only group that made it the simplest but the most special.
=
So no one's gonna talk about Yeba almost tripping at 3:02 then bumping into Byulie ?
We stan talented queens, but they're dorks to the very end...
=
I listen to this at least five times a day 
=
Destiny makes me cry.
Destiny makes me smile.
-Mamamoo, Oct 2019.
=
No one:
MoonByul: DEZ TINI MAKE‘S ME CRY
=
THEIR VOICES THEIR HARMONIES I AM ACTUALLY SHAKING
=
I LOOOOOVE THIS SONG 
=
The last “ratata” tempo reminds me of Infinite’s Dilemma...
=
mOONBYUL, STOP FLIRTING WITH THE CAMERAS
=
Every Mamamoo's performance is like a world tour concert! The energy is overwhelming!
=
Whatever anyone says, Mamamoo makes me sooooo proud. I’ve never felt this much connection to a group and I’ve been a fan of Kpop since like 2008. MOOMOO FA LIFE 
=
I'll be honest here. I've watched every single performance and they're ALL unbeatable. They're all so unique and incredible, I really cannot pick a single one as the best. I keep coming back to all of these vids and the most important thing I've realised is that WE are the winners. We got to see the full potential of all these QUEENS. They're all the best.
That being said, I hope there are no fanwars for the results. MNet is a snake so don't let them set you off. Show love.
=
Mamamoo won? Omg yes! Now I don't have to choose either Park Bom or Mamamoo.
=
I fall in love with moonbyul
=
QUEENS MAMAMOO 
=
Did anyone noticed 3:04 solar tripped over herself?
Anyways,mamamoo is the best
=
That ending pose is the  most beautiful i've ever seen for a while
=
You know how great of a group they are when this MASTERPIECE song is just their B Side track! WOAH. 
Their comeback's gonna be fire! 
=
I hope their perform this song at MAMA along with HIP
=
A lot of people are still doubtful about MMMs win in queendom. Saying they won due to popularity and seniority. It's just disappointing that MMMs hardwork was trashed by antis who are never satisfied.
I know everyone who participated in queendom deserved to win. They're all winners. But please don't comment in this video and in other queendom performance videos that MMM did not deserve to win. It's just disrescting their hard work in perfecting their craft.
Anyways, i watched queendom because of MMM then ended up being a fan of the 5 other participants.
#GoQueendom #GGlove
=
Who's waiting for this performance for damn whole week!!!!.. who's with me!!! vote
=
I just came back online after being grounded... Kill me I was literally begging my parents to let me watch this. Let this be a lesson, this is what you get for failing your classes.
=
I hope Mamamoo sing this song at MAMA 
=
@3:42 Other girl Groups fell in love
=
I've been hearing ratatata tatata in my head for about 2 weeks now and I'm actually not mad about it
=
My friend is a huge mamamoo fan, and I can understand why.  They don’t follow  music trends as much as other artist..it does help that they can write..and because of that, their songs stand out.
=
Fuckingggg QUEENS LIKE THEIR EVERY EFFING STAGE IS LIKE THEIR OWN DAMN CONCERT I LOVE THESE LADIES SO MUCH THEY SLAY NO QUESTION ASKED
=
1:47 chii~ Omg, just close your eyes and listen to this heavenly beautiful voice
=
Can we all take time to apperactie how damn good Moonbyul looked and sounded? She snapped with visuals
=
I like mamamoo soo much they're really talented everytime they performed. They're having fun.... I'm don't why they're not that popular.... They're really talented groups
=
mamamoo deserved to win PERIOD. this performance just solidified it, it was a whole other level and the interactions with the audience made it so different
=
No lip syncing for my skilled queens.
=
i am crying so hard, I cant love them this much, my heart will explote;;
=
MMM vocals are EVERYTHING! Literally out here slaying everybody. I love hearing raw vocals like theirs...can't wait for their CB.
=
Mamamoo tore the stage even without heavy breakdance. Their vocals and their stage presence is enough to set Queendom on fire. I like how Mamamoo never treat Queendom stage as a battle against another girl group instead when it's their turn to perform, they treat it as if its their concert stage and interacting with audience, hyping them up. They are not idols anymore but a true artists.
=
1:35 Why does Moonbyul's voice give me goosebumps...
=
came back here again because they didn't perform it on MAMA
=
While everyone in the comment is so serious let me give you this to brighten up your day 3:01 look at how cute solar is
=
Mamamoo didn't do anything fancy. No over the top costume or props, just a simple stage and only interacted with the audience but still managed to SLAY the stage. Such queens! Other contestants were AMAZING but I always come back to this performance. We really are the real winners. Started watching Queendom for Mamamoo but stayed for all groups. Congratulations to all the contestants!
=
4:09 Hyejin's smile tho
=
3:01 sola highlight
=
Why is this song so good!!
=
Ahhh reminds me of how good music can be. 
Many people like KPOP for their cute idols, but for Mamamoo, people love them for their stable, elegant, and soothing voices.    Honestly, a top tier KPOP girlgroup IMO
=
Mamamoo is the only group who interacts amd hypes the crowd like this  i love how they include the crowds energy in order to make the performance more powerful
=
I just noticed that Solar trips around 3:00-3:05 and tries not to laugh about it. And I've seen this a bunch of times
=
3:03 be careful,solar
=
Mamamoo giving me a goosebumps everytime they sings. Their vocals is really powerful! STAN TALENTS!
=
3:01 Solar being cutie clumsy again ❣ still nailed it.  MAMAMOO for the Win ❤
=
Omg they’re dressed like cowgirls, I volunteer to be their horse
=
LAS MEJORESSSSS <3
=
Now that HIP and the concept has been cleared to me i see how this Destiny n story puts together .
No matter which ever reality they were in they always met we witnessed some in the mv . but like forreal  
Side track n main track are kinddddaa connected if u think about it from diff angle..
=
Bro I feel so proud being a moomoo ❤️
=
Mnet: How many props do you want on stage?

Mamamoo: How about people?
=
I'm in love with this song!
=
This song deserved MV and must be perform in big stage!
=
love the message of the song, the ending pose :') all they need is each other, nothing else
=
This performance shook my whole existence. Mamamoo doesn't need to prove anything to anyone. They. Deserve. Their. Win. CONGRATS QUEENS!
=
MAMAMOO got nothing when they started their career. NOTHING AT ALL. Their company even borrowed money just for them to debut. All the things that they have now are the result of their hardwork. Your idols are very lucky to be in a large company but do you think they would survive and would have successful debuts if they weren't? I don't think so. Things will not be the same. (Don't get this statement wrong)
Actually, MAMAMOO deserves more than this but still they are very grateful because they were given oppurtunities like this where in fact, they don't even need to prove themselves.
If you're thirsty for your idols to win, then WORK HARD instead of dragging others down. It's not our fault if we do our best as a fandom because we will do whatever it takes for MAMAMOO to get what they really deserve.
Yes, they might not be able to invest as much as others on their final stage but their vocal ability, stage presence, uniqueness, and connection to the audience is already enough. They don't need thrones, props and everything, they only need their voices, charisma, talent and their audience to make a remarkable performance.
Look at 3:55, they are performing WITH the audience.
They don't try to impress, they express their gratitude to the audience. 
That's how idols, or should I say ARTISTS should be. They are free to express themselves and don't follow anyone's standard.
Edit: This comment is not made to start a fanwar. Yes, it is a little provocative but please understand that I just want to defend my girls. All groups are deserving and for me, all of them won because they were able to show their true colors. Lets just respect each other's opinion and understand that we have our own preferences. 
MooMoos, lets keep the peace in our radish field! Lovelots 
=
I mean I like Lion but this performance is much more about music. The vocals are perfect. The win was deserved
=
They won because they deserve it. Deal with it.
=
Ewwww

They only won because of their
 amazing talent, angelic voices and crazy overall perfromance
=
iM LOSING MY MIND OHMYGLOB
EVERY. DANG. TIME. MAMAMOO. PERFORMS. ON. THIS. SHOW. TALK A BOUT A BIAS GROUP
=
I don't know why ... i love mamamoo  ohh her voice 
=
This is what we called a masterpiece. Stan talent, stan Mamamoo <3
=
they make every performance like a fkin concert and i wnt to go one huhuhuhu
=
Wish my name was Destiny, just to hear them say it ... <3
=
They always like to get the crowd into it
=
I can't stop listening to the song!! These vocals are addictive!! I stan the right group!!
=
Imagine having an mv for this song 
=
Hwasa's stank face (4:30) and Moonbyul's top lip lift (3:31) gets me every time (their signature habits). This song is a bop and the performance was great.
=
1:48 Solar's voice sounds like Taeyeon's omg
=
3:30 moonbyulll my heart 
=
seems like no one noticed that solar slipped at 3:00
she handle it professionally !! we stan !!!
=
Other people can’t see how talented Mamamoo is. There voices is not joke. I hope you will be able to identify what is talent. 
=
"Destiny makes me cry, 
Destiny makes me smile"
— MAMAMOO 2k19
=
Mamamoo showed us that a GOOD performance doesn’t need many tricks, dancers, fancy motions or effects. You just need to touch people’s hearts with your raw vocals and unique charisma! Mamamoo easily has the besttt teamwork in owning the stage TOGETHER and individually still shining without overpowering the other members. THAT my friends, is GOD TIER. 
Other fans might be sad cos their groups didn’t win but I think that’s not the point. To Mamamoo, it was never about the competition but to always show a better side of themselves and to deliver the best and most authentic performances for fans. With that mindset, to me, Mamamoo has already won from the start.
=
Moonbyul <3
=
as expected from mamamoo. Mamamoo will be remembered as queendom.
=
It's been 84 years and some people still mad that MAMAMOO WON QUEENDOM.
=
I hope they will perform this at MAMA 2019. It's gonna be LIT 
=
when moon star ain't with them on stage, I feel empty.
=
04:30 - 04:32 Hwasabi feeling herself , yasss gurl , you're fire !!!
=
This has been my jam since I heard it!! God Mamamoo can bring it! And Moon Byul is stealing stealing my heart!
=
3:02 solar almost trip 
=
Wheein 
=
I AM HERE AND I WILL COME BACK WHEN MAMAMOO DOMINATES THIS WORLD. YES!
=
Queens of K-pop
=
I will literally never shut up about this
=
No wonder they are winning queendom. Its on another level. And for sure they did not win just because they are popular. They prove their worthy. Maybe i'll become a moomoo.
=
Oooo, Moonbuyl, you stole my heart
=
I think this is my favourite song from reality in black but honestly, I LOVE ALL OF THEM!! <3
=
Is it only me feel like ' i can wait forever' line is meant to be for hye jin voice 
=
This is going to be the best MMM era yet. Perfect song (seriously), perfect choreo, perfect styling, perfect hair. I cannot describe how much I want my hair to look like that.
=
2:22 Hwasa's face XD
=
I always love moonbyuls raps. They're actually so good
=
Each been a......
Their accent is so cute but still love them ♥
=
I love the build up of power from hwasa at 4:32
=
Wheein voice everything
=
moonbyul looks so intense and cool!!!
=
I love how everyone shines. Love this performance
This song fits Queendom xD
=
OMG lyric and dance 2:12 so cool
=
All i see is Mamamoo concert  YESS they deserve to win 
=
Whoever picked that lipstick for Hwasa needs a raise
=
KPop song of the year. Holy shizbiscuits. This is powerful talent right there.

<3, a faithful ARMY who also stans some mighty Queens.
=
the way wheein pronounces "thin" is doing things to me .
=
It's like a James Bond theme
=
I also thought "LION" won but WOW!!! Mamamoo really did a great performance tho, victory is well served. 
=
es que, mamamoo está a otro nivel.
=
''set you free~'' 
OMG goosebump everywhere
=
when hwasa was like  
=
I am not a mamamoo’s fan but I like the performance they did so much. I saw ppl saying that they win bc they have strong fans base or what but to be honest I would vote for mamamoo too if I could vote. I mean they are so unique and talented, their performances are really nice  okie if they win bc of they have strong fans base thn so what? Who would like them and vote for them if they are not good
=
I'm so proud of myself for being a mamamoo enthusiast
=
3:03 solar
=
im here everyday since 31st of Oct, i love their live performance  doesnt seem like one of them is more or less the spotlight than the others.
Yet im still confused da da da da da da ra da ra da. 
=
3:02 oh solar 
=
So they created this song just for Queendom?! WOW
=
They make me feel like I am a part of this performance.
I sing along with them, dance along with them.
And their voices, for me, are enough to win.
=
Someone saw Solar almost falling 3:01 ??? Omg, second time Solar. If I was you nevermore I would use high heels kkkkkkkkk
=
I'M SO PROUD OF THEM 
=
im addicted to this song, love love love the way they performed it. small details like hwasa's actions to some western film sound effects in the intro. in love with the attitude they carried for this stage performance, the kind of chest-held-high and resolutely self-assured attitude. i was captivated by wheein's and solar's expressions and delivery, i find solar exceptionally in-character, her sweeping gesture at 4:40 is PERFECT, i can keep replaying it!!! also kudos to the dancers who executed their last "being flung away" move in sync and enhancing the visual effect of the choreo. ugghhhh, i love this performance.
=
MAMAMOO knows how to connect to their audience and hype the people up that's why all of their performances are dope! 
=
They're ARTISTS dear, so what could you expect from these queens? They delivered top class performances And LIVE. Stan mamamoo, they're coming back tomorrow!
=
I can’t take my eyes off them
=
this song is SO GOOD! i really want ONEUS to cover it haha.
it'd be epic.
=
Mamamoo just deserve the first placeee
=
Who’s here again for the 100thousand time after they announced their comeback
=
I love mamamoo, all of them are very talented!!!
=
Please stream their new song "HIP"❤️❤️
=
Keeps streaming everyday on my way home from work, when I wash my dishes, even when taking a shower  so perrrrrfectttttt!
=
What I love about Mamamoo? SIMPLICITY. 
Authentic, raw and real. That should be the norm of Kpop and not always trying so hard to come up with crazy, impressive stuff to impress audiences.
=
Question: Who's doing it like them?
Answer: Absolutely no one.
QUEENS.
=
Such a beautiful song ❤️
=
I literally have a goosebumps
=
3:00 there is always a time when solar just fell on this show  but they are just amazing anyway ! 
=
4 queens just  mesmerizing ❤❤❤❤❤
=
"Destiny makes me cry, destiny makes me smile" - for me, the entire 5 years with Mamamoo were Mamamoo's era! The ultimate queens. Legendary GG of K-pop! 
=
i know from the beginning that they r going to win
=
A masterpiece ❤️
=
mamamoo out there saving the whole kpop girl groups industry once again
=
I stan other groups along with mamamoo so I was very honest in all the perfromance and watching this people should realize they deserve the win, non of the group had such strong vocals like mamamoo, this was lowkey like a concert and they were able to hype up the audience . they music the chorus went really well. Other groups did great too but honestly dont bash them for winning.
=
Wheein is a bless. Hair color is on point, clothes is on point, the dimple is on point.... yes, you read it right....the dimple. ☺️
=
They were so amazing it took me like 20 watches to even realize Solar tripped 
=
AMO DEMAIS, DEUSAS MARAVILHOSAS
=
I come back every day to listen to my vocal queens and cleanse my ears 
=
I am in love with this song and in mamamoo in general.
=
I love their outfit!
=
I would have loved to see Dreamcather in quuendom 
=
3:01 
name one Queendom performance where Solar didn't trip xD
=
This reminds me of when Coldplay played for superbowl halftime, and Beyoncé and Bruno stole the show. They are real talented
=
WORLD TOUR 
WORLD TOUR
WORLD TOUR
FOR
QUEEN OF QUEENS
=
still gives me goosebumps! excited for MAMAMOO's comeback
=
mamamoo is one of the few groups now a days that race the standards of how a performance should be. Before it was BigBang, 2ne1 and those 2nd gen artists during the golden era of kpop. Now in this 3rd generation I can see the hope in mamamoo, Yesssss they knew how eat the stage 
=
Excuse me, they slayed so hard?! I'm ratatating all the way!
=
I’ll never get tired of saying that they are the best and the most charismatic female vocal group.
=
The stage so lit XD
=
3:01 Solar at the back. Sorry
=
"Destiny make me cry , Destiny make me smile" . 
Fall in love with this part 
R.i.p reply button .
=
Here I am again. I love this performance 
=
When they sing... damn... its literally surreal.
=
No one:
Mamamoo: In the first episode they were sitting like they know they will win and they did. 
What can I say to Queens
=
Im so proud :") 
Been w them since Um Oh Ah Yeah 
‍♀️
=
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW SOLAR TRIP AND ALMOST FALL ON 3:03
I LOVE MAMAMOO THEY ARE ONE OF THE BEST GROUP. THEY DESERVE MORE POPULARITY
=
When they thought its over by solars final blow but then aesthetic formation has been formed by the queens
=
OMG THEIR VOICE ITS SO UNIQUE AND ITS SOOOOOOOO AMAZING WHEN THEY COMBINE IT TOGETHER♥
=
stan talent
=
One of my favourite Moonbyuls rap parts, and the song also highlights the difference in their singing voices nicely.
=
3:01 solar being clumsy❤️
=
Watched 
Mamamoo Destiny - seriously,this is it best song, move on
OhMyGirl Guerilla - ok ok wait what this is definitely best song, click
AOA - Western vibe ok hang on, this is dope best song ever, move to
Lovelyz - another Western vibe, god please help me this is best song, next!
Gidle - ok definitely this is the best song
Bom - ok you know what this is it
I CAN'T JUST PICK ONE.. I'm so freaking tired, always come back to watch every each of the performance..never missed one
=
Im crying, they are everything that I was searching for :')
=
Solar tripped at one point during this performance, I’m just so glad she wasn’t fazed by it ❤️
=
I’m watching it for the millionth time and scrolling through comments and liking everything
=
This hits me so bad.
It feels like I'm in Mamamoo concert
=
Mamamoo remind me of 2ne1 where..  Strong vocal.  No need auto tune and can communicate with audience not to mention free style
=
MAMAMOO won so: get with the winning team ho 
=
3:01 look at solar
=
2:24 wowww ❤ i love this part
=
3:02 ops solar..
=
The song is really smooth ❤️
=
They really out here being a whole WOMAN group ❤️
=
moonbyul look gorgeus
=
It was HELLA epic, and also, I cried kinda while watching the performance
=
Solar really isnt having luck with shoes lmao
=
OMG! I love the song❤️
=
Actually queens of kpop
=
They made themselves LEGENDS!!
=
Love Mamamoo at first epsoide! Their vocals.. oah great! A talent!
=
I muss Hwasa’s long hair it suited her so fricking well!
=
I LOVE THIS SONG AND I LOVE MAMAMOO! ❤️
=
Hwasa’s whole look ended me
=
Seeing all of them (Mamamoo) cry from this award, first time again in a long period of time, I felt all the emotions they have to go through just to pave their way in this show. The fact that they didn't have much time to prepare for this stage, due to their VERY tight schedule, attending and performing at award shows here and there, concerts in between, performing in events left and right LITERALLY EVERYDAY, prepping for their comeback this November, Wheein dealing with her anxiety, seriously, they need rest. REALLY. Seeing how much this rewards them, even though they have received even bigger awards from before, truly breaks and flutter my heart at the same time. They have been working they're asses off and still get hate, get bashed,
 One of the most talented groups in SK yet underrated still, gets lesser recognition than more popular girl groups, which I know in my heart they can top off. Let's not lie to ourselves, they are still underrated. But seeing them like this, appreciating everything given to them, and all their fan's works makes my moomoo heart genuinely happy. I'm truly blessed to be a fan of Mamamoo.
=
Overall, I'm so happy all the Queendom contestants bonded and developed friendships so well. That was made me happiest!
=
Hwasa in dark lipstick always hurts my soul 
=
this makes me cry
=
What can't they do...like they are amazing!
=
Queens claiming their Queendom.
Period!
=
I wish mamamoo was as known as BTS or BP. They're so amazing and funny
=
So i came again coz this is too damn good
=
I mean why MAMAMOO don’t deserve the win? I don’t really mean that other group is bad, it’s just that I feel like this song is the only song that attracted my attention. I listened to all the song in one go while trying to do other thing, but “Destiny” is the only song that made me stop from doing other thing and sang along. The variety of the concepts totally flowed through, which is quite rare. That’s why usually songs are only stick to one concept. At the start of this song, I thought it’s going to be a quite slow paced and Low pitched song, but every part it broke my expectations and took me to another kind of concept. Even though, MAMAMOO as always, don’t have hard choreography, but their vocals always stood out. Even though I’m not a fan of MAMAMOO, but I do really agree that they should won.
=
The moment moonbyul opened her mouth, I got goosebumps. Damn girl. All you slayed!!!!! I’m crying
=
I always love mamamoo performance, they know how to control EVERYTHING 
including props, backup dancers, music & rhythm 
howevers, true talents of them is their voice and singing rapping skills
=
literally im crying
=
so I'm in LOVE love
=
I leave my heart here...
=
t’s been a shining star
It’s been a blue sky
Gonna tell you something about my story
It’s been a long time
We’ve together through
Thick and thin and we won’t desert each other now

It’s been a long time
We’ve together through
Thick and thin and we won’t desert each other now
It’s been a shining star
It’s been a blue sky
Gonna tell you something about my story
It’s been a long time
We’ve together through
Thick and thin and we won’t desert each other now
=
3:02 Solar nearly fall in the back
=
3:03 solar what happened??
=
Masterpiece right here
=
My second fave group. Ofcourse 2ne1 is my number one fave. I get the same vibe when they perform. my QUEENS 
=
Las amooooo!!!!! Son súper talentosas!!!! Me.encanta la canción 
=
Destiny make me cry
Destiny make me smile
=
Queen mamamoo deserve way more recognition
=
The other performances were amazing, really this show was awesome. This one made me cry tho. Totally epic <3
=
The music tho ..
The music producer 
=
Personally I preferred Lion of this, but this is amazing too (Solar and Wheein's hair though ♥)
=
For me, g-idle’s final performance was the best, but there’s something mamamoo have and I can’t excatly explain it. The song is so good, vocals are on top and they have really good stage domination. I’m glad that mamamoo won the show. By the way, moonbyul is cool! Like I said, g-idle and bom were my favorities but I’m glad that such a talented group won.
=
❗❗❗COME TO MEXICO ❤️❗❗❗
=
3:01 Solar mistake
=
Omg my dear solar trips again xD 3:01- 3:03
=
I can’t say anything just trust Mamamoo and listen to them
=
I CAN WATCH FOREVAH!!!
=
This is amazing! It needs more views.
=
めっちゃかっこいい鳥肌たった。mamamoo好きすぎる…
=
Omg... I love this!! No cringy hip sways over an over ! They are actually fun to watch! They actually offer a different scene than your average gg!! Thank you!
=
Newly born Moomoo here. Second time to stan a girl group. 2ne1's my first.
=
I still prefered AOA's 'Sorry' and (G)I-DLE's 'Lion', but this was impressive. Never got into Mamamoo, but they are good.
=
whee’s voice... there’s no words
=
damn the VOCALS!!!
=
*4:40** solar wowed me in this part*
=
Wonderful❤
=
The best
=
Lmao haters be all mmm won because they were popular but the one with the most views is not mmm's videos either
 
They won because ppl voted for them judging on their talent, not popularity.
=
Ending pose ❤️❤️❤️
=
gosh they are epic!
=
The only group with fanchant, the only group that interacts with the audience, the only group without lip sync throughout the whole show!
=
I came here everyday just like freshie to check out their live performances
=
I really wanted gidle to win queendom, but damn, this is so amazing
=
Nearly forgot to watch this today
=
3:00 ‍♀️‍♀️‍♀️ but u slay girl
=
It's 5 minutes long but it's still too short.
=
, my feelings now are up and down at the same time...mamamoo i love you girls, i want to see the video of this song
=
Moonbyul : can you handle it? 
Solar : ofcourse i can
Moonbyul : okey, just do it baby 
3:02 
=
AOA surprised the audience for giving a bombastic opening performance. The crowd loved their concept and attitude onstage. First performance = major blast. That was one of the best opening performances in KPOP. 
Lovelyz went out their comfort zones in a whole new dimension of performance. You can't deny that they have an outstanding teamwork. They are equally talented and they left their mark onstage: the shimmer and glamour. That was splendid.
Park Bom is an amazing woman. A woman of power. How can she deliver that soulful performance without crying? Because the crowd was left gasping and wanting for something to go back. The song is gold. It makes you feel broken and complete at the same time. And Park Bom? She has her way to make you feel all of those. Indeed, she's a legend then and now. 
Oh My Girl showed an impactful performance. The audience loved the strength they projected onstage. The looks in their eyes: it was fire. People was inspired by their dedication to their craft. They owned the stage at the very moment of their performance. That was such a strong final act and believably OMG's. 
(G)-IDLE looked majestic. Visually, they had the thickest stage setup with the props and all. They looked extravagant sending off a fiery charisma. Their performance justified their preparation. The energy was outstanding. You can see their hunger to perform and eat the audience live like a lion. They are promising and certainly they can achieve more heights.
Mamamoo was hot and cold. One has given an ample time to show off their own strengths (that as expected, made the audience felt weak). They can give off antonyms for an unknown reason. They can smile then bite. The can summon fire then ice. You expect them to do their best but you are still surprised. Mamamoo just did a Mamamoo. Simple, elegant but oozing with stage presence. Last blow for the stage: and that was a major wreckage. The connection to the audience just came naturally. They broke barriers once again. Again, they are beyond KPOP. 
Now, let us all be reminded that Queendom (how much we doubted and hated it at first) maybe has its message: empower women. 
So why bring other women down when in fact the 6 groups uplift each other? 
Toxicity kills the truest message. This show is more than a competition- it's more on celebrating women's strength and passion. 
So why spread hate? Join the force because every woman in Queendom deserves the crown as what Moonbyul said. 
Bashful comments for Mamamoo? Just LOL because the fandom chose to remain cool.
=
did anyone else noticed solar almost falling down omg i was so worried but at least she acted like nothing happened  woah queeeeennnn 
THEY DESERVE ITTTTTTTTTTT
=
Their vocals sent me to heaven 
=
3:02 ANYONE REALIZE SOLAR ALMOST FELL OMG BABY ARE U OKK???
=
Honestly, can you even argue their win?
=
every time, the rapper shows up is right on point! and this song is a huge song, it has everything within a song...
=
03:03 I see you Solar
=
Mamamoos stage presence is so powerful, they don't need any extra choreo or props 
=
OMG!! I can't stop listening thi song!
=
Solaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!! u r my destiny!
=
I can't wait to listen the new albumomg
=
Wow! They are so talented!!
=
This song is MEGA. lyrics squizz me i cant, Best break up song ever
=
3:00 I hope solar is okay after she tripped omg
=
1:57 minha morte
=
I can imagine if they are on stage with Big Bang. Their spirit, their energy can equal with that king grup. I can feel the on fire wild vibe of 2ne1 flag in this Mamamoo 
=
Thoughts on lip sync community?
MMM: We don't respect it, it ain't us and we akh-tu on them.
( reference to Hwasa's spitting scene in HIP mv)
=
Hwasa is so hot omg
=
the definition of *power vocals*
=
I’m so proud of them!! ♥️ they really worked hard and this final stage is AMAZING. So excited for their comeback 
=
love them, but I wish they would incorporate more estetics and concepts from Korea instead of from the USA.
=
I’m shook the chorus caught me off guard but as expected we all knew mamamoos songs will come out amazing 
=
MAMAMOO really know how to engage an audience like no other. 
Their vocals are what makes a legend.
Four outstanding and strong women.
=
My favorite girl group ever❤️.... The vocal is soo powerfull I'm fangirling again
=
Moonbyul ❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
My wives delivered per usual- but them backup dancers were doing moves that were beyond average human core strength ✌
=
We stan queen 
=
[ 3:00 ] a cute scene in Solar
=
3:01 LMAO
=
When is their solo comeback as prize for queendom?
=
no one: ....
queendom: ....


Solar: *slipped by her loose bottom at **3:02* ~Oopps I did it again~ 
And continues to walk like nothing happened like a queen.
=
Set you free~
 oh my wheein  im died ❤️
=
We need a dance practice for this omg they are so damm good :> nah we shouldn’t stress them but if they can video one, that would be great cos I love mamamoo dances especially this knife-kill part (idk lol)
=
The true queens!
=
I love Hwasa's expressions in this
=
Solar slips at 3:02! Omg why is she always slipping kept going, professional yeba 
=
My mom loved Hwasa
=
i dont know people always say "they win bcs they're popular" . yeah swetty its truee. so what id function of voting?
=
3:02 Solar! Be careful. I am scared for your ankles!
Is it just me or are those the same shoes she wore for good luck. Those shoes must be out to get her.
=
3.03 Solar's foot slipping
=
Hwasa's hair is give it to wheein 
=
All moomoos sleep well tonight knowing they Stan talented queens


Just kidding y'all let's have a party tonight
=
3:02 Wheein almost tripped there, cuteee
=
I was a bit worried after seeing all the fabulous looking stages from the other groups but honestly this stage just showed that Mamamoo don’t need any cool props nor lighting, all they need is a microphone and themselves. 
=
Oh my god! I loved!!!!
=
The fangirl screams when Moonbyul raps is a mood
=
i love Hwasa so much when she start to smile with that thick lipstick 4:09
=
Queens: MAMAMOO 
=
I can't stop smiling. They are so amazing!
=
This really almost made me cry bc they made this performance very beautiful and they deserve a lot more appreciation than they already doYou can definitely tell that they've  come a long way and have put in the hard work to get where they are now.  
Some people are going to hate on them , but at end of the day MAMAMOO stands at the top. PERIODT. And at 3:02 I hope Solar's okay bc she almost tripped.
=
THE STAGE PRESENCE IS NO JOKE
=
Mamamoo is iconic!
=
Mamamoo never fails to make any stage into a concert. Just this is WOW.
=
That's amazing. It's crazy how good and comfortable they are on stage. And Hwasa opening the song at the beginning should be a thing my goodness
=
The only performance where audience sing along.
=
Soooo Queendom = Mamamoo are AMAZING concert queens + Park Bom is lonely & misses 2ne1 
=
Oh wow!!! You know? I love mamamoo so much!
=
spoiler ahead;
When they won, I cried with them— I’m so proud of them and I’m too overwhelmed. I guess I can’t sleep tonight. Thank you MAMAMOO, thank you Moomoos. Thank you because we all worked hard!!! MAMAMOO COMEBACK SHOW LEGGOOOOOO!
=
OMG QUEENS I CAN'T BREATHE

=
Guitars rly suit their concept 
=

=
I saw you solar  such a pro...
=
Da BEST!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
=
I really prefer MAMAMOO's live ver than their studio ver. It's just so satisfying to listen.
=
I hated this song at begining but now im in love with it❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
If they won by popularity, then why G-idle didnt win????
=

=

edit: why solar always slip xD
=
Moonbyul : destiny makes me cry, destiny makes me smile
Moomoo : destiny makes us win

=
How the beat switched up when Moonbyul came out
=
They got fan vote for them, yes, because their beauty? Remember Netizen used to diss their beauty? Huh anti fan? Don’t tell me that your reason to claim that they don’t deserve to win
=
Mamamoo never lets us down! You are legendary!!!
=
There voices sooo goood!!!❤️
=
The way they interact and hype up the crowd like that, no wonder they won first place.
=
They just radiate Queen Energy! SO HAPPY THEY WON! They deserve it ♥️
=
HOW MANY TALENTS DO YOU WANT FOR THIS STAGE, MAMAAMOO ?

ME: YE-

*MAMAMOO : RATATATATATATATATAAAAA*

=
The final winer is MAMAMOO.
IT CANNOT BE DENIED AND DIFIED.
=
Imagining collaboration between moonbyul and han from stray kids, i think it will be the great performance.
=
Wow powerful voices 
=
Cant wait for their cb
=
Perfectas y hermosas como siempre 
=
it's not about extravagant outfits.
it's not about the stage presentation & props.
it's not about the huge fandom.
it's about talent and these four showed everyone how they deserve to get the title “Queendom”
=
I know there isn't such thing as perfection,  but.... this was just pure perfection 
=
3:26 hwasa is a bit late on the dance lol still slayed
=
Omg that fall at the end
=
Solar is so hot, damn.
=
ok they deserve to b part of BB50 RETWEET AND COMMENT !!
=
3:24 it looks like she was about to cry.
=
remember they joined Queendom JUST FOR FUN and they won 
=
Did anyone notice Solar almost fell at 3:02 and Moonbyul was looking to see of she was alright?  my moonsun hearteu
=
Hwasa's skin tho. So beautiful
=
tipico diferenciar los gritos de move-nim de fondo XD
=
Why moonbyul always looks like minhyuk btob but female ver
=
Mamamooooooooo... Oh my god! This is too good to be truuuee!
=

=
im inlove with the girl who wore white

=
Oh man this song... IS SO FRICKEN GOOD WTHHHH
=
Suka bngt part nya monbyul

Wheein @1:26 
=
only mamamoo has fanchant in final performance..
=
Wooooooow!!! They really deserved to win, no one can deny it.. look at that talent, voices, choeography, energy, cool..! I love Mamamoo
=
LIVE VOCAL QUEENS
=
Hwasa’s expressions are to die for.... I love them
=
How.POWERFUL!!!
=
Mamamoo starting Queendom as the first performer on the first eps with a SPARK. And today they ended Queendom as the last performer on the last eps with a BLAST 
=
Moonbyul rap's always shock me. And thats legit girl
=
This is really GOOOooD
=
Stan mamamoo stan talent and ilysb moonbyul
=
omg did noone notice solar tripping on 3:01?
=
Did anyone else see solar trip at 3:03? 
=
SPEECHLESS
=
This is tanlent, thank you queens
=
Who keep rewatch this performance although it has been long since Queendom end?
=
holy shit this is concert level performance
=
See,,, they’re worth the ending stage
=
haters : MamAmOo cAn'T dAnCE
mamamoo :
=
still not over this. 
im still not over this and i never will
=
I fall in love with the song since it released 
=
Mamamoo deserved to win even though I m a neverland here sorry they totally deserved the win I mean I swear this performance gave goosebumps
=
Moonbyul, why i like your costume always yours
=
Waiting for mv
=
Amo está canción (*+*)
=
Solar 3:01 LMAO
=
This show was the best, they all win 1st place
=
I can see why they won if this song had anything to do with it. I thought nothing would top G-Idle, but Mamamoo always dashing my expectations. Like they have the stage presence, the power, and they have fun on stage while interacting with the fans. They are truly amazing. I felt this song and stage in my soul, I can't even explain it. (Another thing I noticed about Mamamoo is that every one of their members always fits their concept no matter what they do, but yet they still all have their own indiviudal style and charisma and they all shine in their own way, like thats something that other groups just don't/can't do)
=
what an experience
=
this song fuckin slaps iTS SO GOOD
=
In my opinion mamamoo are the best girls group in performing makes you so happy to watch and they always surprise me with their performance
=
So cool, i love mamamoo
=
Always Mamamoo is the queen of K Pop
=
im not surprised they won tbh lol. they hyped up the crowd and put a twist into the song instead of serving it plain. job well done, mamamoo. congrats on winning
=
this song deserved a mv
=
Mamamoo
=
Show: QUEENDOM
Song: DESTINY
Artist: MAMAMOO
Genre: MAMAMOO
=
am i the only one being emotional when watching this? especially the "ratatata" part with kmoos' chant?
im just so happy for our queens 
=
the camerawork is just... *chef kisses*
=
雞皮嘎搭阿~~太棒了!!!!!
=
The Queens of Korea 
=
Solar really isn't having any luck with her shoes in this series is she lol She always manages to stay looking professional though <3
=
This perform is everything
=
Las mejores ❤❤.Adoro su fuerza y vocal,son impresionantes 
=
Solar being clumsy again at 1, 2, 3:00
=
haters : mamamoo can't dance while singing.
mamamoo : okay, hold my cowboy hat
moomoo : say sike right now
=
Solar fell in the background at 3:02 HELLO OBSERVANCE
=
It was good and the deserved to be the winner. But I am a little sad that oh my girl didnt won :(
=
Ok but this song and whole stage is the definition of crying in the club. One moment we're bopping so hard and by the end of Wheein's last note and that hug, you bet my ass was tearing up. Mamamoo really did that.
=
this song is so good, will definitely check mamamoo out
=
to those saying mamamoo won because we got a "big" fandom. did u think only moomoos streamed their song? the general public streamed their song, thats why they charted! we don't actually have 100 accts each to stream every minute so we promote them so hard and it actually pays off plus the song is amazing thats why. so what if your faves performance was trending, did their fans stream the songs tho? did the people who watched their perf streamed their song also? stop saying its ALL about the fandom numbers, we worked our asses off in promoting them too. its the numbers + amazing performance + hardwork of mamamoo and moomoos that got us that no. 1
=
unbelievable voice！
=
Back here~
=
AME TODO ME ENCANTO 
=
i just finished the final episode and just watching their performance again is like my soul is stolen
=
This is additive
=
I hope they perform this once again on Music Show
=
I'm not interest in kpop but this gp girl make me love their vocal song how can I search their song ..are they new.just stream their song starry night its cool
=
Wheein's visuals are killing me, I swear
=
THE QUEENS HAVE WENT AND DONE IT AGAIN! I STG IF THEY DON'T WIN 1ST THERE'S GONNA BE A WAR!!!
=
damn this b the same level (maybe a lil higher) as kill this love
=
anyone notice solar tripping in the back at 3:01 or is it just me ?
=
Congratulations Mamamoo on winning Queendom, it was a win well deserved and as a fan I'm over the moon. I was a little hesitant in wanting to watch as I didn't like the concept of the show pitting female artist's against each other but I was so curious to see what you would bring to the table. I'm so glad my curiosity got the best of me because not only did you deliver each week with your vocals, stage presence and charisma but you also exposed groups to me that I never knew I needed nor knew existed. I started watching this show as a fan of Mamamoo and Park Bom but now the show has ended I'm a fan of all the contestants involved and I can't wait to see what everyone does in the future. Congrats again Mamamoo for winning the show and congrats to G Idle, AOA, Lovelyz and OMG for winning over a new fan.
#MultiStan
=
queendom is the perfect hashtag!! hwasa's face is just the best when she's feeling it :D also this song sounds a little like starry night and I love it!!

Hoping yt's not gonna sue me for pressing replay buttons a million times since this song was posted here. Mamamoo answered your issues with ratata tatata!(machine guns sounds)
=
I've been listening to Mamamoo eversince their debut. I was amazed by their vocals, I have their songs in my playlist but never really dived deep. As a kpop fan, I'm more of a lurker. I just like groups but I'm really picky and the only fandom I had was A+ (MBLAQ). They're the only group I loved deeply also almost Cassie but Idk the spark stopped but it doesn't mean I don't like TVXQ. I still love them but not that much affection as I had with MBLAQ. SO TO CUT THIS SHORT. I WANT TO STAN MAMAMOO. CAN YOU GUIDE ME HOW TO ENTER THIS FANDOM CAUSE OH MY GOD I'M SO IN LOVE WITH HOW TRUE THEY ARE ON AND OFF STAGE, HOW TALENTED YET HUMBLE THEY ARE, HOW THEY ENJOY PERFORMING SO MUCH. OMG LIKE I'M SOOOO IN LOVE WITH MAMAMOO RIGHT NOW THAT I'M ABOUT TO FUCKING CRY. HAHAHAHA UGH ILY MAMAMOO
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
This song is so good. It deserved to be their comeback song. They are so incredibly talented.
=
Omfg this is MAMA performance material
=
The song is so good and they have so much presence on stage that it gives me chills. This is what I call artists
=
MOONBYUL'S RAP IN THIS SONG OH MY GOOD GOD
=
Imagine them collabing with LM and performing together. The world ain't ready
=
*Vocals on point*
*Visuals on point*
*Rap on point*
*Choreography on point*
*Charisma on point*
*Stage presence on point*

*Queens on point*
=
Mv of this please
=
Perfectttt
=
1:18
=
Actually they dont need to dance to get attention, they have charisma and vocals. Individually different and have their uniqueness. Why not to stan MAMAMOO?
=
1:13
=
This is epic
=
=
I don't really know why but i get really attracted to moonbyul
=
❤️
=
Congratulations on being top 10 in billboard digital songs for kpop
=
I stan a very popular gg (not participating in this competition), a group that is very famous outside Korea (I think you know who I refer to) but Mamammo is on another level. Their stage presence and confidence on stage is something very unique of Mamammo. You can't even call them cute, because their persona says otherwise. They exude sexy and sultry personality which give them a very mature image which is uncommon to Korean pop groups where everyone desires to portray a very cute and innocent representation of themselves. Mamammo don't care about that. They do what they want to do (props up to their recording company for allowing them to have every Independence in their musicality as much as they want)  and Mamammo do it the best way they can, always. When ALL Korean girl groups are  the Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift in Western music; Mamamoo is the ultimate performer, queen Beyonce.
=
MAMAMOO IS MAMAMOO!
=
We can all hate Mnet for being a snake (let's hope neither Izone nor X1 will be ruined) but no matter how unfair the show, I feel like both Produce and Queendom helped many idols and let them shine, solo or in groups
=
Moomoo's: I miss hwasa short hair and big hat
Hwasa:
=
1:14
=
True talent.
=
Mamamoo win Yeah 
Told u mnet MAMAMOO_Queens..

Well, Comeback show coming~~~~
=

=
超愛Destiny的。

=
STAN MAMAMOO

=
1:27
=
❤QUEENS❤
=
Love You Mamamoo!!!! 
=
solar at 3:02 though hahahahhah
=
.... guys... if an artist uses an actual microphone, that means that MOST LIKELY what you’re hearing is what they’re SINGING LIVE. 

I may be biased, but live music is so much more important than an extravagant dance performance.
=
1:27 
2:41
=
Their live vocals alone is enough to win this...what if you include dance line, charisma,stage performace, style's Yea they are deserved to Win.thats why they are the winner.Congrats Queens!
=
3:02 SOLAR!
=
This just gives chill and shivering down my spine every time I watch this
Mamamoo is ABSOLUTELY the best Performers of 3rd Kpop Generation
This stage has everything, the opening, the story, the Climax, the bridge, the fuc king hype beat, the mesmerising end
The experienced and expert skills, the confidence, the self-confidence, the self-acknowledgment they have is EVERYTHING ✨
=
holy crap i rarely see mamamoo dancing so hard they slAYED this man
=
ngl this is the best mamamoo song
=
GENTE FORA A MÚSICA PERFEITA,  PARA MIM SÓ DEU A SOLAR QUASE CAINDO.. AKAKKS TADINHA
=
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
Me encantan!!
=
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
Does anyone see solar get slipped?? (3.02)
=
歌うまっ、、！？
=
QUEENS INDEED
=
妈木超棒
=
FOR THOSE ANTIS OUT THERE SAID Mamamo DON'T DESERVE THE WIN
have your favs singing live without or little backtrack, playback, pre-record, autotune, lipsync first
then we continue our debate
=
Im a blink,moomoo, blackjack, Neverland, forever, and a merry and they make their own marks and cherish any marks that they make because those are special
=
=
I hate when some of the fan claim that mamaoo dont deserve 1st place, n think their fav group that are more fresh, young talented are deserve more.. Hey, if u dont know MMM, dont try to condemned them.. They are under rated goup, take a few years to become famous group. Because of what?? Because their voice are so pure and angelic. And they dont care about anything, either they win or not. They performed just for their fan, and they deserved the votes. Please dont question either they got 1st place or not..
=
=
lol Solar at the back @ 3:02
=
3:29 3:29
=
2:41
=
Wow
I love this so much❤
=
2:41 2:41 2:41 2:41 2:41 2:41
2:41 2:41 2;41
=
I just wish a MV for this and sorry from aoa too is too much?
=
This is the thousand dollar question..... I’m so surprised why they were not given the proper recognition they deserve...... it’s out of question about their talent, and they have their unique style and personality..... not like other common girl groups..... I admire MAMAMOO so much.
=
Good job for all of the dancers support, they all did a great job
=
I want everyone to win tho...
=
3M
=
Ohh wait haters said they lipsyn? Heard that 2:12 mic hit then..u should try to search mmm lipsyn bcs its 404:error lol
=
Bisa ngasih like berkali-kali, pasti ku like berkali2. Suka banget sama mereka... 
=
OMG the starry night vibe
agree?
=
this song is a whole another level I just can't stop singing with them  
but to be fair, stage-wise Lion by (G)i-dle was more advanced as a final stage. 
but ofc I'm not mad at this at all both of the group are so big
=
They were born to be on stage.
=
الاصوات خورافية عبالك پلي باك
=
Moonbyul. Stop being too handsome!!!!
=
♡
=
เสียงแน่นมาก...ชอบอะ
=
Whew
=
what i noticed is mamamoo can make any song fun. ily mamamoo
=
Aye when will they stop (don't) are they trying to make me question my sexuality
=
my fav 1:12
=
MAMAMOO is no joke are idols that most k-pop idols should take example of
=
3:30
=
Worth to stan this group. Despite of all bad comments, treatment by their appearances they're still stayed humble  I'm a new fan, but never failed to amazed me and felt that I'm in the luckiest fandom ever!! Congratulations MAMAMOO! YOU ROCK EVERY SINGLE PERFORMANCES IN QUEENDOM!!!  Deservedly much uwu  from  
=
These vocal queens are truly a total performers but lacking international fame :(
=
♥️♥️♥️
=
Rainhas do meu coração 
=
Please comeback with this beautiful amazing song:)
=
i cried
=
Solar 3:01
=
how many people agree with me that their stage presence is 
=
I got goose bumps when hearing every single second of this song
=
gurls literally slayin' this performance without any props or anything. just their mics and extraordinary talent
=
They seriously need a comeback with such a song
=
OH MY GOD THIS IS INCREDIBLE MAMAMOO DESERVED IT SO MUCH
=
Everytime Mamamoo is on stage, It feels like it's a Concert
=
No one can beat Mamamoo when its a singing competition like ♥️
=
I CAN'T LIE, THIS IS TOO LITT!!!!
=
Damn just look at this amazing performance  I should thank this show beacuse they made me to be a big fan of mamamoo
=
cant wait for mamamoo will sing this song in MAMA 2019, it will be lit performance ever
=
3:00 yongsun i saw that 
=
Love the Vocals!
=
3:01 Solar almost fell there haha
=
I've listened to MAMAMOO since 2014 and every single performance they've done has given me the best goosebumps. Not many kpop groups can move me like MMM. They are humble and constantly improve their skills too. So happy and proud for MAMAMOO!
=
Omg this is so totally my war song! This is like my BGM whenever I run into my exes. I can already imagine 
=
Their vocals are amazing!
=
Good job Mamamoo! You gals deserve it! Can do live dance and sing at the same time! :D
=
Wheein's voice? Another level.
=
I love how once they drop the final chorus(after interact with the public), the latatas are entirely by the public. Did anyone notice that?
Start and finish the show with Mamamoo was the best decision for Queendom.
=
Mamamoo ❤❤❤
=
I love these talented girls more than anything else and our beautiful fandom too
=
they say the talent of a group can truly be determined by the amount of same-gender fans they have. this is where mamamoo and big bang differ from their peers
=
I can't help but keep coming back to this performance. Mamamoo ily.
=
Whoa i know what the reason Mamamoo won, I got goosebumps when I watchinh this Video.
=
3:01 solar almost slipped/fell lol but queen is unbothered.
=
I'm from Taiwan , and I wanna say......
夭壽讚~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!!
=
3:04-3:06 poor yeba freakin trips  HANDLED IT LIKE A CHAMP THO I LOVE THEM
=
I love how they like to hype the audience
=
ok queens, dominated the stage
=
Congratulations mamamoo for winning
=
Se me han puesto los pelos de punta❤️
=
MAMAMOO IS QUEEN!!!
=
can't wait for their solo show comeback y'all 
to all filipino moomoo, may gc ba sa fb or twitter HAHAHAHA i need someone i can talk to about how much i love these girls pota
=
Mamamoo ♥️
=
Si lo espera ellas son las reynas ❤
=
THEIR STAGE PRESENCE
=
1:44 Is Solar talking about what happened to her and Eric Nam in We Got Married
=
I STAN TALENT  MAMAMOO 
=
Omg this song is so good not only did this make me stan mamamoo but now im starting to stan lovelyz
=
3:01 solar hahahahhahah best wom
=
I am big fan of mamamoo from India ❤❤ 
I really love you
=
Moonbyuuul ❤
=
So proud of these queens. They deserve to win.. End of discussion! Somebody call the firetrucks, that stag is on 
=
3:02 Ok ka lang Solar?
=
So happy that they won. I was screaming mamamoo the whole time while the host wanted to take 30 minutes just to announce the winner..
=
Hwasa i'm devasted
=
BRUTAL! 
=
I'm watching again again again
=
They always make s stage like they own conser
=
Creo que ya puedo morir en paz ❣️
=
Oh em geeeee!! Solar almost tripped at 3:02.
=
Everyone else: Does a comeback stage
Mamamoo: Let's do a concert/award stage✌
All stages were Lit but this was so different. No one does like our Queen
=
if Starry Night and Wind Flower had a baby: DESTINY!
=
Wheein is UNDER-RATED for sure
=
I...i...m speechless..no wonder Mamamoo is my ult bias group (queens)hwasa n solar at the end..my heartuuu..Congo 
=
Ignore those who said mamamoo dont deserve to win. If they really sane, even for a non fans you can see mamamoo talents is another level and various in terms of 'artist'
Mamamoo literally stand up alone  since before by their own talents from a nugu company, getting mistreat even fr a music show, media, and msnake especially. Its not all about popularity ( yes its one of it) but *SAY TO ME TALENT WISE WHO IS THE SAME PAR LIKE MAMAMOO*
LET US ARGUE face to face ~
If there is none, so stu
=
A rare Hwasa and solar moment too, love them so much, they r so cute
=
3:22
=
Our queens!!!!
=
"Destiny makes me smile" 
"Destiny makes me cry"
#Moonbyulie 
#Moonbyulie
#Moonbyulie
=
At first I watch queendom because of g-idle but now I’m a fan of mamamoo especially wheein
=
Queen of Interaction 
da~ dadada! dadada! dadadada~ dadadadadada!!!
EVERYBODY DA DADADA 
=
The number one thing that made this stand out for me among the others was the fact that they engaged the audience in their performance. It's like they didn't perform just FOR the audience, they performed WITH them. And it must have been so exhilarating to see them live like that, with their vocal prowess and stage presence. Not that I'm saying the others were lacking at all, they were all so so soo amazing! But just because of this one thing that has always been unique with Mamamoo as a kpop group, who didn't always focus on giving a by-the-book performance, they stood out for me among the rest.
=
At 4.10 hwasa ‘no.. im not crying!’
=
Mamamoo: shakes the stage with their live vocals
Backtrack: am I a joke to you?
Moomoos:yes
=
Please!!!!!! Perform !!!!! This !!!!!! At !!!!!! MAMA !!!!!!!!!!!!
=
2:44
=
I thought lion deserve the win before watching this but this one is crazy too the vocal is just wow! Mamamoo never disappoint!
=
This is, you all can tell them as "Respected Idol" by people, other fandom and other idols
=
Who are you kidding this isn't even a performance.. its a story telling...talents overflowing
=
Good lord, I was wondering how g-idle didn't win this but now that I'm actually watching this performance... they blew my mind. I don't know them well (yet) but I definitely have to after this!  That main rapper is straight fire and all their voices are so angelic!
=
I’m so in love with the song 

Destiny makes me cry
Destiny makes me smile
I can wait forever 
It’s been a shining star
It’s been a blue sky
Gonna tell you something about my story
It’s been a long time
We’ve together through
Thick and thin and we won’t desert each other now

Such a meaningful lyrics ♥️
=
They might have simplest stage but the power each of them hold is incredible. Even theres 1000 dancers on stage 4 of them still stand out most.
In the end Mamamoo own the whole stage and the crowd.
=
OMG. I love their ending scene soooooo muchhhhhhh <3 They deserve to be the winner. yay!!!!!! <3
=
This perfo made me cry, i lov this girls so much
=
Im so proud of my babies ❤
=
THEY SURE AS HELL KNOW HOW TO PERFORM
=
I LOVE YOU MAMAMOO ❤❤
Philippines
=
Moonbyul: *smiles
me: *dies
=
I love when they performed all of them shined  together without covering other members
=
egotistic:iya..iya...iya!!
gogobebe:ela.ela.ela.ela??
destiny:ratatata..ratata!!
ME:mamamoo..mamamoo..mamam.o.o.o???
=
They are so beatiful with that new hair 
=
Lets just make it simple. Mamamoo is not just your typical idol. They are your SAVAGE ARTIST! Slaying a performance is their trademark! I became a fan 3 years ago with every performance they showcase.
=
I mean this is ART THEY ARE MY QUEENS 
=
Mamamoo OH MY GOD!!! If only i could hire them for my wedding. HOW I WISH
=
Well deserved win ❤️
=
What an amazing performance!
=
3:02 poor Solar.. i love Mamamoo
=
Mamamoo is my second fave gg , next to 2ne1. Glad they win, Bom also slayed. This show is full of talent and not just a soso kpop artists.
=
I love when momoos call their name ..
=
O B S E S S E D oh my gawd♥
=
Watch solar at 3:00 
It's alright, still a queen
=
4:10 Everytime also want to 送你基佬 
=
Goosebumps! !!
=
3:00 solar slipped
=
my goddesses!
=
Wheein you did it. From bias wrecker to my official  bias now....♥️
=
Oh hwasa cut her long hair. 
=
I need the full full audio to this (mostly meaning the “I can’t wait forever part.”)
=
They dont even need an extravagant props to make a cool stage performance. Their voice and stage presence are already enough to make the crowd go ratatatat!
=
My Queen 
=
when byul put her foot on the dancers... i felt that.
=
wow its different seeing hwasa and solar with that short hair
=
Their song the best among the rest
=
wow, the vocals
=
Keren banget ini mah, walaupun bukam fans tp klo ada lagu2 mammamo pasti tertarik denger atau nonton
=
Mamamoo never disappointed!! Mamamoo nunca decepciona, orgullosa de ser una imomo vamos por ese nuevo regreso y álbum!!!
=
Wow just wow
=
This melody like starry night.. I like both song.. Good mamamooo
=
I’m loving their stage presence .
And can we talk about the short hair girl’s STANK facial expressions? So powerful !!!!
I’m a blackjack but damnnnn this was littttt
=
THAT AUDIENCE INTERACTION PART WILL ALWAYS SEND ME ITS INCREDIBLE U GUYS
=
As you can see, only Mamamoo can always do this people participation in every performance. It's like a concert when you see them perform.
=
Honestly, I was skeptical when they announced they'll join this competition because Queens don't need to prove themselves anymore but I realized them conquering this show is a blessing so people who are not familiar to them will know who are the real queens of Kpop. I'm not hating on other groups but we all know Mamamoo deserves more recognition being a vocal powerhouse and legit performers since day one. Spread your Queendom Mamamoo!
=
Everything about this performance is on point: vocals, rap, choreo, expressions, visuals, and as always, they let the audience be involved on the performance. I love everyone that competed in Queendom, but let's not be blinded by our fandom and talk negatively about the winners. We all know Mamamoo delivered a winning performance. And everyone gave such great performances!
=
Just saw someone say mamamoo won because they're popular... does anyone know how popularity works??? Especially in an industry?? Its no surprise that they'd win considering they have all the assets required to stand out on stage. Vocals, stage presence, charisma, a good understanding of what engages an audience. Great music, that first and foremost, MOVES the listener. It's ironic people would pull the "popularity over talent card" considering they didnt even accumulate the most views on queendom! Just face it. They deserve the win. They proved themselves. Anyone who says otherwise and tries to discredit their accomplishments, is, for lack of a better word, salty.
=
The ending. The way they really ended the show in the most fun way by involving the audience and then... THAT FINAL POSE. 
Mamamoo truly legendary
=
who else are going back here again, and waiting patiently for the mv of this song?
=
Not a fan but this is definitely stage of the deserving winner 
=
my fav part is 1:42
=
I know everyone is saying this in the comments but I can't stop myself from commenting this...



NO ONE CAN DO IT LIKE MAMAMOO.THEY ARE ICONIC QUEENS.THEY ARE ARTISTS AND NOT JUST IDOLS.END OF DISCUSSION.
=
It is shocking how similar aoa and mamamoo concepts and song are but both groups portray the concept differently in their own unique way
=
No one:
Definitely no one:
Not even a single soul:

Absolutely no one: can do it like MAMAMOO QUEENS
=
The song is BEAUTIFUL
=
=
they WON even when mnet tried to be a snake and closed voting 3 minutes after their performance - if anything, this only shows the power of moomoos!!!
=
did anyone notice solar trippin? @ 3:01 lol queen
=
.,ahhh!for 100x that ived watch this,.gotcha solarsido,.from 3:02-3:05,.yungson unnie forever,.nevertheless  amazing performance!!
=
My queen really slayyyyyyyyyyyy so bad in this song 
=
The ending pose should be kept in the museum. EPIC.
=
Mamamoo deserved the win.
Reason being, the other songs are really good, but this song is more of an emotion. Or maybe, Mamamoo makes this song an emotion.
=
*"MAMAMOO never gave out bad performance"*
It's not a compliment

*IT'S A FACT*
=
I used to love Blackpink a LOT, but now Mamamoo have been my favourite GG. Congratulations queens.
=
Mamamoo came from a small company. On their debut day only family & friends came to cheer for them coz they have no fans that times. Their path was not easy, struggling to be recognised, being compared of standard beauty with other GG idol & being an artist with a different music approach was not an easy, but they never give up! They climb up slowly step by step with blood, sweat & tears.
 Now, the world recognise them as a Queen . Thank you so much to Kmoomoos coz always support them, cheer loudly for them till they have an international MooMoos.
Please don't hate them because they won Queendom, they really deserve it! Your Idol & Mamamoo are friends now. They like & love each other. Don't waste your time with meaningless fan war. Peace ✌️ 
=
Can’t believe Mamamoo invented *c h a r i s m a* 
=
As a massive moomoo, I'll be honest, some of their recent songs haven't captured my attention as much as the old stuff, although their songs certainly haven't gotten bad by any means. But this song... Has really captured my attention. This is exactly the kind of song I've been waiting to hear from them. It's classy, it's fun, it's clever, and it's most certainly exciting. The song feels like one massive buildup, as even the chorus doesn't relieve the tension. If anything, the chorus accelerates the song and drives it forward at an even greater speed. But when the bridge came... Wow. I mean that has to be the most well-earned and satisfying explosion of sound I've heard from K-pop in a while. 
So many K-Pop girl groups these days have badass, powerful concepts with loud but tasteless drops in the chorus. Mamamoo, as per usual, stick out from the crowd and takes the road less traveled. This has to be their most powerful deviation yet. Truly, I'm stunned, and I can't wait to see what other kinds of energy they're going to bring to their new album coming mid-November. Great job girls!
=
They deserved 100% to win, I'm so proud they've improved themselves a lot. Now support Mamamoo because they're having a big comeback soon.
=
everybody knows that mamamoo is the best k-girl group that ever existed, their outstanding vocals, all of them kills others 
=
Did anyone else notice that Solar tripped in 3:02
=
Hwasa's short hair still kills me ugh They're not just idols, they are artists.
=
DAMN STAGE PRESENCE & CHARISMA MAMAMOO HOLDS. EACH MEMBER GOT DIFFERENT COLOR TO SHOW BUT TOGETHER THEY CREATE SUCH BEAUTIFUL HUE. THEY CAN DEVOUR THE STAGE SO PERFECTLY.
=
I was having a hard time deciding who I wanted to win between OMG (I'm a miracle) or AOA's comeback which I loved but, this song is amazing and the performance was so good.
OH MY GIRL will be forever my Queens and that's never going to change. But MAMAMOO is definitely royalty.
=
MAMAMOO comeback with their 2nd full album 'reality in BLACK' 14th November 2019 6PM KST, look forward to it :)
=
They even make me forget about other presentations. I mean they just closed with gold brooch.
=
THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY LEGENDARY!!!! WHAT MAMAMOO DID IN THIS FINAL IS WHAT THEY CALL ICONIC
=
Them: Who is your bias?
Me: Mamamoo 
(Deym I LOVE THEIR EXPRESSION, MOVEMEBTS, VOCALS, STAGE PRESENCE. I JUST EFFIN LOVE THEIR EXISTENCE. Deym Mamamoo, you never fail to amazed us)
=
Congrats on the win Queens
=
MAMAMOO is making a comeback very soon with their 2nd full album 'reality in BLACK' on 14th November 2019.
=
I cant believe this is perfect song...
I start cry
=
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS ALTHROUGHOUT THEIR PERF OHMYGOD
=
mamamoo officially the queen of kpop and is running the show
=
What a performance ❣️
=
At the end of the day even if your choreography is the bomb, a song is meant to be sung. And oh gurl, can MAMAMOO SING! Their vocals are drop dead gorgeous and the power and energy they exude is beyond anything. Love them so much! 

Also: this song is everything!
=
WHEEIN I LOVE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU <3
=
WAIT WTF NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS
=
I became mamamoo’s fan when i watch egotistic.. and at queendom i’m so proud with that☺️☺️☺️❤️❤️❤️
=
Their stylist does a really good job of making each of their outfits unique to their personality without making one member stand out from the other. They look like a team rather than having one member stand out, having all in completely different outfits, or having them all in extremely similar outfits.
=
OMG Hwasa's short hair!!!!
=
Every performance looks like a concert
=
Absolute GODDESSES 
=
Just noticed yeba tripped again lol are you okay solar 
=
Short hair suits Hwasa the best ❤️
=
Maravilhosas!
=
Best performance and song <333
=
when solar almost trips and fall at 3:00 but she walks it off and shows everyone who’s queen  and that she’s here to win 
=
Will we have a MV for this perfect song ?
=
YAAASS COWBOY CONCEPT
=
didn't even see solar trip at 3:01, wheein's voice was too mesmerizing
=
Now that's a wrap... What a legendary performance.. 
=
Well deserved win, honestly the effort put behind this song shows. I got goosbumpssss
=
AMAZING!!!
=
 Long life to the QUEENS 
=
WHAT!!!!  
Chills
AMAZING!!!!!
=
Queens❤
=
Was watching this when my friend came up to me and ask.. so which of these girls is your favorite? 
Me: (when Hwasa touches her hat) her! 
Me: (when Solar walks out) her! 
Me: (when Wheein sang the first word) her!
Me: (when Moonbyul starts rapping) her!
Friend: there can be only one favourite..... 
Me: *ignores*
=
Who has joined the Mamamoo cult?
=
this was one of the most amazing performances i've ever seen holy shit
=
moonbyul ❤
=
Reinas 
=
Queens yes or yes??
=
Want high quality performance? Mamamoo got you covered.
=
Please, mv
=
Algo que decir... Mis reinas  si ellas son mis reinas MAMAMOO 
=
SHORT HAIR HWASA IS BACK!
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Okay but Hwasa in dark lips wearing all white is my aesthetic
=
WOOOOOOW
=
why aren't mamamoo and g-idle more popular, they are the next generation groups with actual charisma and concept
=
I smile coz I know loco is
=
I smile coz I know loco is
=
This looks like a freaking stage that could be in Coachella ❤️❤️❤️
=
waaah gila...
"Destiny makes me cry, 
Destiny makes me smile"
like this part
=
2:22
=
I hope they perform this song at MAMA2019
=
they criticize mamamoo just bc their favorites didnt win .. negativity at its finest ..

To those who are saying that MAMAMOO did not deserve their victory, and that their idols were robbed, READ THIS
ALL GROUPS ARE DESERVING TO WIN. THE MOMENT THEY WERE INVITED TO COMPETE IN THE SHOW MEANS THAT THEY ARE WORTHY. SO STOP BEING IMMATURE DRAGGING OTHER IDOLS DOWN JUST TO UPLIFT YOUR STANS CAUSE IT WON'T DO ANYTHING GOOD.
To defend my ladies (MAMAMOO), they are deserving like any other group. First of all, they worked hard. They were be able to get a strong fanbase and to capture the hearts of many because they chose to be different, artistic, and they really love music. They are destined to be a performer. THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN SONGS. THEY WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS. For some that are not satisfied by them, who thinks they don't do complex choreos and do not sound like other trendy k-pop songs, well, that's MAMAMOO. They don't follow anyone's standard so get over it.
If you do not like their musicality or maybe because it's simply too much to handle, I understand BUT dragging them down and saying that they're not talented and undeserving is UNACCEPTABLE.
Yes, they got the least to gain from this show but THE SHOW IS NOT ABOUT WHO "NEEDS" TO WIN.
All groups are very lucky to be able to show their true colors and to highlight themselves, and all of us should appreciate this wonderful chance to be able to witness these.
Our idols are very grateful for this kind of oppurtunity. I am sure that for them, winning is only a bonus achievement, what they truly got from this show is FRIENDSHIP and IMPROVEMENT.
SO STOP THE FANWARS PLEASE

wtf did she cut her hair already?
=
Lol the dance move is simple looking but rythmic and den when u actually tried u will pant like crazy and den also look like shit
=
I love how the crowd goes wild for them, Queens indeed.
=
They are the real Queens
=
They slapped me with the visuals then stomped me with the vocals. 

I just wanted to eat my bagel.
=
Whoa
=
=
*Imagine this performance at MAMA 2019! I'm already getting goosebumps!!*
=
No wonder they won. They’re another lvl
=
 their interaction w the audience, their vocals are so stable
=
What that you need for a good performance it's not just a good property but it's about a good song, good vocal, and you must good in delivery that song.. And that's what Mamamoo need.. They are just need MIC for fight in this competition.. Well done girls..
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
waaahhhhhhh
=
If Hwasa's short hair won't kill me, Wheein's charisma will surely be the final blow.
=
Destiny and My Star need to be performed at awards show
=
I showed all the performances to my mom without her knowing my bias group (she did know I have a soft spot for bom though) and she said after watching all the performances Mamamoo was what impressed her the most. (G)-Idle was a close second for her but she said that while they had a wonderful performance she felt Mamamoo's killing parts, stage presence, engagement with the crowd and full focus on the song is what made them win. All the teams did amazing but Mamamoo's win was well earned ❤️
=
Ohhhhh, this is a competition...
I thought it was their concert...
THEY SLAP HARD
=
They were constant throughout the whole show while every other group were on and off and they tried their best and still there stages was amazing. Remember when they had a concert the day before they performed? Wheein was not in the best condition but she still rocked it. Korea voted for them. They had the best digital sales. They won her over it
=
I think this was their best stage in Queendom, and they deserve #1.
=
The other groups’ performances were also really good, but the deciding factor for me is the fact that mamamoo interacted with the audience!
=
I'm so proud seeing these queens slaying stages and doing what they were destined to do! 
=
HELP—
my brain: Destiny makes me cry
HELP M—
my brain: RATATATATATATATATTAATATATATATARATATATAT
=
Msnake, now tell me who is your MAMA? 
BISH
=
Absolutely love this blend of different concepts! Anything MAMAMOO does, they smash it! TRUE ARTISTS WITH VOCALS, STYLE, PRESENCE, MUSICALITY, AND LOVE FOR FANS 
=
they just know how to include the audience perfectly
=
The cowboy motifs are everywhere and I'm living for it
=
THEYRE THE BEST IN LIVE
=
4:26 love this music part
=
3:03 solar almost slip. I'm so scared
=
3:02 Solar so professional
=
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
=
This group reminds me more of 2ne1 than blackpink
Not a hater
=
Really I love u ♥ Loves from Turkey  ❤️
=
@ 2:41

Move-nim: WOAAAAAAAAAAAA
=
Omg!!! 
Que belleza, su música hace que me emocione mucho, estuve gritando durante la presentación 
Sus looks son asombrosos, todas se ven más preciosas que nunca ❤️
¡Felicidades Mamamoo por haber ganado, han trabajado tan duro! 
=
I knew from the start that Mamamoo will be the winner. vocal, performance, stage presence, just damn
=
*The signature MAMAMOO hypnotic sound*
=
Put aside Mamamoo's huge fan base, this performance alone really killed & shot my heart, my wig & everything. Bom's performance was also great because of it's raw emotions
=
This gives me starry night vibes and gOd I am loving it
=
3:00 focus on solar, she almost tripped again
=
My QUEENS
=
THEY FREAKIN WON 
=
Am I the only one who can't stop looking at wheein ??
=
Atlast! I've been waiting for this!!!!
=
4:09 maybe I melted a lil bit
=
Omg i love them... oh my wheein i love her she looks gorgeus
=
Ok come to realize I prefer Hwasa and Solar with long hair and Moonbyul and Wheein with short hair but both pairs are opposite of each other 
=
I live for the final pose!
=
This is giving me a new version of starry night
=
Wow!!!! Love this! Love them! 
=
From a completely external perspective (regardless of the competition or favored groups), this song was awesome and caught my attention.
=
soliotoiiii <3
=
Meu deus do ceu, que performance perfeita ❤️ rainhas
=
You know how in every performance, audience impact is a very important component right? Mamamoo is doing it right by making people part of the performance by hyping them up. Not only are they serving talentry and slayage, but they also made people feel the connection with them as well.
Good music + Good performance + stage presence + connection to the audience = victory.
Congratulations to Mamamoo for winning Queendom! Well deserved victory!
For the other groups as well, congratulations for doing so well.
At this point I’m just happy that everyone is getting the recognition that they deserve with this show. Everyone was scared, but here we are with our ggs being close because of this.
=
I NEED M/V ASAP !
=
petition for this to be the song mamamoo performs at mamas
=
Queens of perform, no doubt. Congratulation queens.
=

=
now that is how you do a PERFORMANCE

"I don't need to perform 4th in order to win" - mamamoo 2k19 
(Context: 
1. G-Idle performed 4th for Latata and was ranked 1st for the mission
2. Oh My Girl, as a group, performed 4th for both Destiny and Twilight and was ranked 1st for 2 consecutive missions, dethroning G-Idle
3. Oh My Girl placed Mamamoo as the last performing act for the final mission when deciding the order of performers
4. Mamamoo was able to change when they were going to perform (could've performed 1st since they performed 1st for Decalcomanie and Good Luck or could've performed 4th due to the 'good luck charm' for performing 4th - they won the mini challenge for shaking off sticky notes
5. Mamamoo sticks with Oh My Girl's original order and will be performing last; thus, not using the reward) 
mamamoo is the only group that's able to destroy the good luck charm.
=
Mamamoo making this show as their concert  this is not fair lmao
=
Am I the only one who noticed that solar almost fall in her face? she's so cute!
=
May Hwasa’s long hair rest in peace :,(((
=
I'm an international fan, I first encountered Mamamoo because of Park Bom's song which featured Wheein, that is then when I got curious about her and found out about Mamamoo. 
In that very simple statement, what you actually don't see, is that Mamamoo, is not actually (much) "KNOWN" internationally. This is for those telling me that Mamamoo is not underrated. Yes, they might not be underrated in SK, but tbh in my country, whose people are engaging massively in Kpop industry, most of them don't even know Mamamoo. 
Sad truth, millions of views count, it does count, it's a huge part of what sells nowadays, its considered a great portion of what it is to be deemed "KNOWN". You cannot reason out that people don't have time to stream because that's not how it works. Today, it is what the industry is about, attracting people, consumers, ones who'll buy the albums, stream on chart sites, etc..thus it is vital for all artists and idols. These shows are good for PR, but is it enough? Yes, being looked up by the other contestants is good, but is that enough to say that a group is not underrated? Will that change their international branding? NO. 
And I know Mamamoo themselves told us moomoos to be calm, and be happy for all their achievements, but I will never stop saying they are "UNDERRATED" like it's a sin to actually realize what's really happening right now, until they get vastly recognized. I will not swallow my pride and settle for this, I will not be ignorant, for I know in my heart, MAMAMOO DESERVES MORE. They deserve ALL the great things, they deserve to be more recognized in South Korea, and moreover internationally, with their huge amount of talent they even deserve it more than other/some well known groups, who relies mostly on popularity. 
I know it is because RBW isn't capable of promoting them properly, but these girls have been working so hard for years, they started from scratch, paved their way, it's all taking time but I hope it will all immensely pay off someday. 
If only I have a huge amount of riches, I will promote them so hard it will b*tch slap all those haters and bashers. Haha. Kidding aside.  I will promote them so much that the world will get a chance to see how wonderful and marvelous they truly are. But for now, I will never stop supporting and defending them every way in their journey.
=
Good performance, every person has their own talent.
=
Vote this VOCAL QUEENS in MAMA 2019 THEY DESERVE IT they deserved being first place in queendom
=
Props? Nahh, MMM got this covered.
They served us vocals, and talent, and charisma, and audience involvement. Ugh, MMM signature.
=
I’m a giant oh my girl fan but I knew mamamoo was going to win. Tbh I thought mamamoo deserved it just as much if not more. I’m really proud!
=
I love Hwasa's short hair!!
=
3:03 moonsun moment heheheheh I love moonsun and solar was like skipping and walking as fast as she can to moonbyul so cuteeeeeeeeeeeee ok other then that they are queens of talent and everything

=

=

=
I'am crying. This make me so happy. Finally getting the recognition they were destined to ❤️
=
They always make me cry with their performance. Waaaaaa  This is soo good
=
1:13 Goosebumps when Wheein's part came up 
=

=
I know why mamamoo deserve they win! This performance is really neomu wanjon daebak GREAT! And they sing it live beautifully! I just see the other performance too, they do their great performance too, BUT MAMAMOO IS DIFERENT! THEY REALLY DESERVE WIN!
=

=
Moonbyul oppa!!! Hahahaha

=
As a Neverland, I totaly agree that Mamamoo are the Queens ❤
=

=
professionalism is once again defined by solar at 2:59
=
Look at my CHARMING PRINCE!!!!!
=
I love this fandom
=
Solar got trip at 3:02
=
3:01
=
Goosebump
=
Congratulations to Mamamoo!! putting competition aside, QUEENDOM is a celebration of K-pop girl groups!! I couldn't pick a winner. I'm glad that these hardworking and talented girls are getting more recognition through this show.  Let's be kind and be more supportive towards girlgroups. They are the ones who faced criticism and get bashed the most. I think they deserved the attention and love as much as K-pop boys!!!
=
Stylist: How much tassels do you want?
Mamamoo: YES
OMG QUEENS SNAPPED 
=
Other fandom really be hating on MMM for winning when they themselves were lazy to stream the song  like dude, mamamoo literally topped the chart
=
HAVE YOU GUYS NOTICED SOLAR LOW NOTE & HWASA HIGH NOTE TOGETHER?????
=
They did all the stages with their best, they destined to go more popular and hot!!!!
=
The art of this song, up, down, slow, fast, emotion, energetic, roller coaster, all in one.
=
WTFF????!!!! THEY ARE DANCING! AND THOSE VOCAL WAS ON POINT!! STAGE PRESENCE IS UNDOUBTEDLY LIT!! A QUEEN!
=
Wheein “set you free” gave chills
=
When did the moomoo memorize the fanchant?
=
this performance proves that, simplicity is better than, too much.
and no matter what happens. queens are queens.
=
Mamamoo SLAY
=
With this performance, you know they deserve to be #1. All 6 songs are so special in their own ways, I can't tell which I prefer, but the performance of Mamamoo outdid the others 1 step. The way they cooperated with the audience decided their victory. It reminds me of Bohemian Rhapsody, the scene in which the band communicates with the fans as one.
=
omg,mamamoo espero verte en los MAMA Y MELON ,ESTE AÑO
=
Wowwwwww
=
They are always look at the fans with such a loving heart, always makes them a crowd like in concert, reel them into the song, makes them want to sing together with them! I even watch all of the MAMAMOO's stage in Queendom for more than 6 times already, I-...something in them resonate with me, making me want to watch again and again?? I... CONGRATULATIONS FOR WINNING GIRL 
=
Dear International kpop fans, this is mamamoo video. don't mention other group. RESPECT MAMAMOO!!
=
raise your hand if you stan mamamo, if not then raise your standards
=
Mamamoo is the only group who has no weak member! Each one of the girls is very strong and talented alone or in a group ❤️ hear that vocals, it's heaven on earth and that rap ❤️ gosh I can't breathe 
=
moonbyul marry me please
=
omayghad did solar got trip?
=
Oooooool.
CARAJOOOOSSS ❤❤❤..DIOSAS
=
On repeaT
=
Mamamoo is like a improvising jazz quartet, and they can read each other.
=
im a neverland and honestly I was rooting for gidle but when I saw this performance... lmao sorry but mamamoo totally deserved the win
=
I would like to say I' m Gidle fan but I respect that Mamamoo won they are good and I love their vocals! One of the best gg ever in k-pop ;) ,❤️
=
They're look like fallen angels but their vocals are like rockers❤
Angel Rockers!! Fighting!
=
Rather than a girlgroup, they suit word "diva" most.
=
They wrote: we dont desert each other now 
=
3:02 Solar almost fell 
But they killed it and won, they are the best. ❤
=
Lendas maravilhosaaaas ♥️
=
Honestly for the final. My favourite songs were from MAMAMOO and AOA.
=
I can no longer count how many times I've watched this performance since they've won! and..I have already listened to this song before the finals and its really addicting..
ratata-tatata-tatata-tatata
=
This competition starts with MAMAMOO ✨
=
what can be said about MAMAMOO that hasn't already been said? like, damn!
=
OKAY I AM SHOOKETH MY NAME IS DESTINY AND HEARING MAMAMOO SAYING MY NAME IS MAKING ME CRY❤❤❤❤❤❤ I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!!!
=
Make me feel so freaking good
=
thats the power of mamamoo.. they can control the crowd! power!
=
From now on,I'm fan of mamamoo
=
when solar was being carried in i was deceased
=
This song is just amazing, I really like it
=
this song is amazing and the performance outstanding...!! love it so much, they deserve the win
=
I'm in love with this song!!!!!!!
=
Is Mamamoo the only one who has a fanchant? I don't remember the other groups having
=
Hwasa’s outfit omg
=
Hwasa's short hair dear lord 
=
finale spot + 4 ultimate queens + chant-like chorus + signature crowd interaction = game over, no competition
=
Ineed mv for this song like g-idle
=
Mamamoo ❤❤❤❤
=
Vocal wise, they are the best.  congrats Mamamoo. from Neverland 
=
I'M SPEECHLESS 
=
All the groups performed so well.....I listened to all the songs and watched all their performances   ....
Mamamoo never disappoints ♥️
I was scared as they always perform so well  ,I was afraid how they were gonna top all their performances..but afterall mamamoo did it once again ...
So proud of them ....their song and performance was so different and amazing...I loved every second of it ...the beats to
Ultimate queens ♥️
=
3:01 solar almost fall (again)
=
I got chills as soon as they started singing. My girls did the damn thing in boss mode. They won because they deserved too. Hell they could have sung the abc's and won!  
=
Amazing mamamoo
=
5 minutes of overflowing *TALENT* and *BEAUTY*
=
I need offial mv of this song.
Love it
=
that prechorus with the guitar is SO GOOD
=
I was crying the whole time when the announcement went out and they were the winners. More so when Hyejin choked. My babies, I'm so proud of you. ❤️❤️❤️
=
I already knew that this Queens has the possibility to bring home the crown
=
One word to Describe MAMAMOO 

*_QUEENS_* 
=
Omg mamamoo is so good
=
"mama Muh"
=
Im obsessed with this concept. QUEENS
=
Anyone noticed at 3:01 Solar almost tripped?
=
damn kpop not worth having them, i demand world tour!
=
1:50 !!! THE BACKUP DANCERS
=
THIS IS SO GOOD WTH 
ALL OF THEIRS PERFORMANCES ARE SO GOOD IM NOT EVEN SHOOK AT THIS POINT
=
Queens of engaging the crowd
=
I love you Mamamoooooo!!!!!
=
I hope they can make an mv for this song since they have done 2 mv before for their previous comeback such as starry night era.
=
I was rewatching this and i just saw solar almost fell around 3:02 she recovered so fast that it wasn’t really noticeable how P.R.O
=
I love Hwasa's hairstyle omg, she's so God
=
♥♥♥♥
=
They are legendary
=
♡♡♡♡♡
=
2:27
=
absolutely well-deserved. they sang live, delivered stellar performances and consistently brought something new and unexpected to the table at every round, to the point where it would have been a crime if they didn't win. so in conclusion, stan legends stan mamamoo.
=
So... this is gonna be long. 
Honestly I’m not a big fan of winning over popularity because, like many things in life, not because you win/lose something does it mean you truly deserved it. However, in this case, the popularity win was incredibly deserved, you cannot deny that. Why? Simple: our queens worked their asses off for years to achieve where they’re now. (MooMoos also worked incredibly hard but our main motivation was them) Of course a group from a small company is gonna have it harder than big company’s, again, that doesn’t mean that the ones for the big company don’t go through the same effort. 
Everyone did amazing in the competition. Stop fighting and bringing each other down. Yes, everyone deserved the title and I wouldn’t be mad if someone else had won. 
But I don’t know, the reason why stared liking Mamamoo the way I do is because they are different (not in the cliché way) you can just feel the connection through their music/performances. And that’s what an artist is truly like. It HAS to move you. 
They can make you feel fire inside with without even doing much. I feel like sometimes people want a performance with a lot going on(where it can come off as messy) but I think there are times when is quality over quantity and just because something is simple doesn’t mean that there’s not beauty in that. 
Their voices are outstanding, they are gorgeous, their presence is just undeniable. Everyone knows that. 
That being said, I really want to say so many things, but as a supporter of them I’m so happy and proud. I think our girls need to be proud of themselves the most. They are so amazing. 
Mamamoo, you truly deserve this and so much more. The best is yet to come.
=
=
WOAWWWWW
MAMAMOO
=
Solar slipped again at 3:03 and tried not to laugh hahaha. She's so cute. That little smile she gave to Moonbyul was so precious. But seriously what is wrong with the stage of Mnet. It's like she always slipped when they perform. Mnet you better fix your stage so that no one would slip again.
=
What makes MAMAMOO unique is that they include the audience to their performances. You won't just stand there and be amazed by their greatness but MAMAMOO will encourage you to participate, so people feel that they are part of the performance. That's why fans enjoy their stages because they connect to them in a personal level. 03:55 is proof and so as their performances in Immortal Songs.
=
Solar almost trippin' at 3:02  but slayed as the true pro that she is!!! Queen!! 
=
I need a fancam of wheein. She be slaying the dances, my underrated dance queen
edit: OMG thank you all for the likes. First time I got this much likes 
=
i watched/listened to this multiple times, but like am i the only one who always break out of their resting face when hwasa makes that scrunched up face when she dancing hard at the chorus?
=
Simple but berclasses
=
Oh. My. Gohd
=
Congartulation...
=
mamamoo is a real artist , their performance just like an art . i mean every single performance is just like a show , they are  enjoying the moment when they're on the stage . mamamoo deserves this win ,yea
=
Still watching
=
Single terbarunya girband mamamoo'sangat bagus'dan keren apa lagu lagu hip
=
Quá đỉnh luôn
=
solar 
=
“(Kpop) Idol” does NOT apply to MAMAMOO.
MAMAMOO are ARTISTS. PERIODT. ✨
=
Only  thing  ı love  about  the  song   moonbyul  s part  
=
Does anyone know wether or not Mamamoo is going to make music video for this? Because this song deserves an MV
=
After watching this I get why Mamamoo won.   They didn’t just put on a show, they WERE the show, meaning each one of them was captivating.   They made you FEEL something.  It starts with the vocals.   It’s not just about hitting notes, it’s about EXPRESSION and EMOTING.   They felt like WOMEN and the other groups felt like GIRLS.  (Same goes for Bom).
=
So basically there are a lot of ppl claiming that MMM won bcoz of their popularity or big fandom base COME ON
Lemme tell u that MMM start with zero fans 
Came from a small company
They have to do busking on streets where no one recognize them
They had the OLD image when they first debuted 
They went on Immortal Songs and put up good performances but no one knew them
MMM fandom wasn’t built in a blink of an eye we MooMoo chose to be their fans bcoz we knew how much effort they put in to become good artists 
The other grps on Queendom might have experienced the same as MMM and YES I liked all of the stages in Queendom final but pls don’t waste time spread hate when u can love someone more with all yr might 
=
The difference between mamamoo and the other groups is that mamamoo doesn’t need to go way over the top to be amazing, this performance was in many ways way simpler than the what the other gg’s did. But yet they were the best performance of the night because of their strong vocals and charisma. I’m so proud of them❤️
=
I'm in love with moonbyul's part 
=
Every performance, it feels like watching a concert. They're just sooooooo amazing
=
Mamamoo harmonizing together needs to be a more common thing in their songs!! So beautiful
=
The only girl group I love  Their vocals and stage presence are INSANE
=
OMG I REALLY LOVE WHEN THEY SAY NOW SCREAM 
=
3:02 Solar, be careful. Moonbyul is concerned.
=
Wow el final es especialmente mi parte favorita, ver a todos los moomoos coreando "tatataRatatata"
Y la fuerza que ellas pusieron en este performance...increíble
=
Hope they release special episode, last gathering or clips of idols beeing together 
=
This is the real art 
=
Proud moomoo here! ❣️
=
MAMAMOO is the real definition of QUEENDOM!!!  Congratulations!
=
I love mamamoo!!! AMAZING SHOW!
=
They truly deserve that win! So proud of them 
=
I repeat it again and again WAHHHH CONGRATULATIONS!!!
=
Oh my God so amazing 
=
Anyone saw Yong trip again???
=
3:30  Make sure y'all got that screenshot xD
=
All I can say is.... I love them so much 
=
Oh ......my heart 
=
Congratulations Mamamooo...
=
Congrats My Queens !!!! <3 <3
=
While watching all the performances yesterday, I realized how every group deserve the win, but when I watched Mamamoo's I said to myself that there's no way they will place lower than one. People in the comment section said that some haters are trying to discredit them because they're popular in SK, but if you think about it a group will get to that point of popularity if they got the talent of being an idol/artist.
=
Whoaaaooo daebak...finally our Mamamoo win, congratulation, U deserve it
=
Mamamoo are a national treasure.
=
Byul! You made me want to be your girlfriend 
=
hwasa looks are so powerful, i fell more for mamamoo so happy to know that they won, atlast they prove to everyone that they are the real queens 
you know guys ive been a fan for a year and I know that they are not famous or has a fandom like those famous kpop groups such as bp twice red v g idle etc. You can also watch random kpop dances and it's rare to have many people dance to mamamoo's songs because they are not recognized towhat they deserve unlike other groups that aren't even so talented and confident like mamamoo. Mamamoo deserves to win they catches soul unlike other groups who just know how to be sexy and such btw i dont hate other groups i love them but i still see the difference
=
My queens. 
=
that’s like one of the most beautiful and amazing songs i’ve ever heard
=
I stan legends..
=
Why is no one mentioning Hwasa's short hair!!!! 
+ Queens are on fire  
No wonder they won ♡
=
MAMA needs this performance!!
=
Congratulation mamamoo
=
Mamamoo congrats!!!!
=
Hwasa n Solar ☺️☺️
=
I hope they have another song like this wind flower and Starry night
=
so some fans out there are saying mamamoo in bcoz of popularity, hey you, do they knw that mamamoo works their asses off to give us wonderful performances, their song charted high than other ggs participating in queendom. K netizens love their songs, whether they are promoting it or not. K netizens didnt even question their credibilty, lets be honest its actually the intl fans who complains abt mamamoo winning. Its not all abt performances, its abt the song dude, and also popularity? they are popular bcoz their songs are so good to listen and they work hard for that.
=
Elas estão deslumbrante, não consigo mais parar de olhar, são muito maravilhosas ❤️
=
MAMAMOOO WILL FOREVER BE NUMBER 1 IN MY HEART 
=
Hwasa short hair is back
=
Mamamoo never disappointed
=
No wonder they won....
=
So who thinks this song will be on the new full album?
=
PLEASE LET THEM HAVE A WORLD TOUR CONCERT
=
Dance practice pleaseee
=
Writing this comment because it hurts me when certain fans are bringing other groups down...

I don't understand why people would complain that MAMAMOO won just by popularity...
Undeniable, every group stands out, I love all the groups, they all did amazing!

But this performance really gives me all the goosebumps...

If you really wanna talk about popularity, (G)I-dle definitely has more views and likes compared to MAMAMOO (I watch (G_I-dle  too, because I love their performance too, such talented girls).
Please stop saying MAMAMOO won JUST by popularity... just acknowledge their hardwork and talent... There's no need to bring down other groups just because your bias didn't win...

Like what Moonbyul says, everyone is a winner.
Let's just appreciate how all six groups bring joy to the audience.

I love MAMAMOO and was interested in (G)I-dle since LATATA, they brought me to watch this show, and I'm delighted to see Park Bom (2ne1 is the group that makes me fall in love with kpop), surprised with AOA's charm (such cute personalities and cool performance), amazed by OH MY GIRL's wholesome performance (plus they have extremely friendly vibe), motivated by Lovelyz's positivity (they are so daring to challenge themselves through different genre).
P/s: Agreeing to what Marylin Urquieta(from the comment section) says: "our queens worked to achieve where they are now".
P/s 2: Please stop complaining that MAMAMOO didn't dance as much compared to other groups... First, they dance and looks incredible with their moves... Second, dances are cool, but they are called singer, singing comes first, if they feel more comfortable with these types of choreography to sing, let them be! (I definitely can't dance like them, its tough)
=
Shitttttt 
=
Whenever they look at the camera, its like you can feel the connection, its them singing the song to you.
=
i repeat 4:40 on and on
=
0:32 Can we talk how the dancers walk solar in the stage
=
看完全部舞台。真的…真的!mamamoo最棒，不愧是第一名。简简单单就超有感觉的。根本不需要多余的东西，他们4个就可以撑起了
=
I saw Solar tripped
Like if you guys see it
Or comment...
Or whatever
=
The performance itself was simple but left a feel of why it end so fast? A feeling of wanting more remains. Mamamoo was simple and at the same time powerful.
=
     
=
I thought the song was gonna end 3 times but it didn’t lol
=
Mamamoo... Deserve to win.. Why... Bcoz.. Their so talented.. Their music difference from other group kpop song..... Mostly they interact with audiences....Mamamoo is real artist... That why they deserve to be call Queen...congratulations Mamamoo and moomoo...
=
English: Destiny
Korean: uri burururururururururururururrururhsshnakajdjwkwnwdh
=
I got chills, there’re multiplying
=
My maaaaaaaaamaaaaaaaaamooooooooooo
=
Your'e all the best queen
=
Wait  I thought it was byul harmonizing with Hwasa but it was Solar ??!!!
=
I. NEED. AN. MV. FOR. THIS. SONG!
=
The stage is so simple, lackluster even, if i dare say, Yet the friggin chills are still there!! I'm not devoted enough to call myself a fan, but damn, can't get bored watching them perform
=
Mamamoo won the show?
=
I just watched the rest of the contestants' performances. Tho they're impressive, they all look like idols performing for comeback. While mamamoo right here really owning the stage. Their vocals, charismas, swags and moves are on a whole another level compare to the others.

Also the other contestants' performances are too messy with too many dancers or their dancers' clothes simply match them. I can't even tell the difference between the idols or the dancers anymore. Glad mamamoo wore white while the dancers wore black.

Edit: my comment here is a general one but you only care about g-idles and keep fighting about 'em. Not even once y'all mention the other contestants' that i supposedly "lowkey shading". Just say you hate mamamoo and want g-idles to win and go. Sheeshh.
=
i lovee mamamooooooo so muchhhhh
=
Wig snatched I thought gidle had a hot performance this right here was life
=
what’s crazy is how busy Mamamoo was outside of Queendom, they were going to many events so they had to make time for queendom, not only that but they must be exhausted, i hope they get their deserved rest now that queendom is over 
=
I want Gleam and Destiny to be performed on MAMA2019
=
The girls killed this performance in every way possible with their vocals dance and stage presence


Also special shoutout to WHEEIN ..... she needs more love
(Plus her voice was so angelic)
=
what else can't they do. I've been listening to this song like---since this morning. So excited for their comeback!
=
the best show~~~
=
Moonbyul's rap parts is my fav parts !
=
Omg.. Hwasa short hair.. Im dying
=
They are Mamamoo! 
=
Can I just get a hug like that from Hwasa too 
=
Hwasa looks so beautiful here I love her hair
=
OMG Wheein looks sooooo beautiful  Mamamoo really did it.
=
OH MY GOD I WAS ATTACKED
=
Congrats QUEENS!!
=
かっこよすぎだよおおおおおおおおおおお

=

=
All their competitors did great! But this is in a whole new level! This is so strong, fierce, refreshing and the best thing is how they love performing!! I'm so proud of MMM
=
Yg berkali2 nge repeat like .. 
=

Hwasa's smile at 4:08 was so warm and sweet and honest.
=
Mnet: how much talent do you hold?
Mamamoo: yes
=

=

=

=

=

=

=
When the whole playlist for all the 6 songs I agree they were all good but mamamoo really took the spotlight during the live performance 
They truly r mamamoo 
N mamamoo doesn't disappoint when it comes to performances or even anything in general
=
Omg QUEENSSS & bby Wheein looking cute at & Solar always looking great with blonde hair 
=
Love this. Mamamoo are literally queens 
(But I dislike the camera movements and angles)
=
=
Damn no wonder they won. mamamoo hits differently man, congrats to them
=
I’m living for wheeins new blue hair and buyls purple and basically everything
=
妈妈木实至名归啊!我爱四姐
=
i truly feel like they are preparing us for their next concept involving rock or alt rock, WHICH I AM 100% READY!!!
=
2:42 if moonbyul rap dosnt make you gay or blush then i dont know what will


Btw Mamamoo you guys killed it like literally
=
LEGENDS ONLY
=
Hi MAMAMOO. Hope you will read my comment. I just want to say thank you so much for making me happy and inspired. Please stay healthy and safe so you can continue to inspire us with your great talents. Do not mind your haters. Your fans, US, are more important than them. Please if you are sad or feeling lonely. Do not hesitate to message me. I am here always for you guys. Stay humble. I LOVE YOU MAMAMOO! ❤️
=
Oh my wheein looked like she lost a whole lot of weight
=
ok but like solar tripped @ 3:02
=
Did anyone else catch solar tripping again at 3:02 No just me?
=
Mamamoo deserve win.. they are the real winner... they are my pride of kpop 
=
Ah they are best not only in vocals, I am glad that they won!
=
One thing i notice evertime mamamoo performs, they always connect with the audience as if audience are part of the group..everytime they perform you will feel that they really love their fans..by the way count me in as a new moomoo. Cant wait for their comback..Congrats Queens you rrally deserve the title..
=
I have read some comments saying Mamamoo is popular in Korea, but for me they are still underrated, considering the vocal and the stage presence they deserves more than this.  Well done MMM, bring it on. I know they will win MAMA's vocal award.
=
solar slipped and looked hurt
=
Is it a new song ?!
=
So what if the choreo is kinda easy? They still rock the stage and hype the audience. Their stage presence,facial expression and attitude on stage is lit. And that's what you call a performance.
=
Please look at Solar closely at 3:02. This is the second time after she almost fall down during second round "Good Luck" performance.
=
Slayyyy!
=
hwasa is literally the korean beyonce
=
Okay not gonna lie I'm a hUGE moomoo but honestly guys a member of G-Idle literally wrote and created Lion, which literally blew me away. Mamamoo has the best voices hANDS DOWN but let's not shit on them because the talent in that group is also UNREAL. My love for Mamamoo has never been so threatened by another group before and it's leaving me so shook
=
Killed it. Nailed it.
=
Mamamoo is really an awesome group, they're just true to themselves and their music, I'm not even a stan but their i miss you performance made me cry fr, they're true artists, and the way they always find ways to connect with the audience during the performances is awesome too, also hwasa is awesomeee she's always so into it
=
Let's applaud for those Moomoos who supported our girls during the performance.
They were so supportive and passionate, cheered for our share as well.
=
Their performance is  it feels like a concert
=
Sooo prouuuddd of theemm on winning this!! We've come a long way but still they're proving why I lovee them soo much and deserve so much!
=
4:08 Hwasa smile-satisfaction when crowds become one with them
=
The vocals and stage presence  also moonbyul BODIED that choreo
=
I'm super excited about this performance and love them so much. Every group was so good too. Every performance was awesome.
=
I’m sorry. But Hwasa with short hair just slayed me.
=
That ratata part got me like 
=
Best fandom goes to MooMoo! Though I am Miracle (OMG’s fans), but I was really amazed by MooMoo’s fanchant and cheering from the beginning till the end, awesome! Mamamoo really deserves the winning <3
=
deserved the win absolute QUEENS
=
I keep watching this till today and 4:40 always give me goosebumps
=
MV for this please~ <3
=
I need Hwasa's lipstick. 
=
Didn't want this performance to end.. SO GOOD
=
So proud my angels!!
=
Mamamoo stan, talented stan. 
Ağlayacağım, çok güzeller.
=
Congratulation to 1st Mamamoo
=
WOW SO COOL 
I  LOVE IT
=
Mis niñas de Mamamoo que hermoso cantan <3 se lucieron totalmente. 
Congrats  Mamamoo  :D you did a great job! I can't wait for your new album :D
=
Damn mamamoo!
=
Perfecto 
=
3:04   Solar ))
=
Las mejores del universo  Reinas de la vida! ❤❤❤
=
So proud of my girls....
=
I love Solars new hair so much UghHgh ;(
=
Omg how can i show my feeling how much i love them ?
They are so talented.
Sent some love from cambodia.
I hope you 1st place.
=
Looks like other contestants forget to make a fanchant for the final song  to much focus on performance they forget to engage with their own fandom 
=
RBW please  I hope you showed MV Destiny
=
Honestly if MAMAMOO won by having a great fandom, I don't care ... what matters to me is that I win
=
Just yesterday i saw the lyric video for this..and now i can see them perform live...MAMAMOO have my respect..always great on stage..they killed itlove them more n more
=
Congrats Mamamoo!!! , but at 3:02 Solar tripped and almost fell
=
to those who say that mmm's performance is effortless comparing to other groups , well gays this is a SINGING show , music is for listening not watching...
=
This song, their voices are just AWESOME!!!!!!!!
#really hope that one day Moonbyul can be vocal too, her voice is nice too
=
Suara nya bukan kaleng2 
=
I just watched queendom because of MAMAMOO 
They deserved to winnn ❤️❤️❤️
=
GENTE SO EU QUE TÔ PIRANDO COM ESSAS ÚLTIMAS APRESENTAÇÕES MARAVILHOSAS DIVAS AAAAAA❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
This song vs Wanna Go Back ...?-able
=
I saw da hee’s post and I’ve been finding this vid! FINALLY
=
Solar nearly fell. 3:02
=
Wow reyna talaga!!
=
oh, hello bublé. your lyrics are good, look.
=
Omfg I feel so lesbian-
=
the POWER
=
I’ve just watched all the other performances and I completely understand why mamamoo won. The other performers were really focusing on making it as big as possible, like in your face u know? With this performance mamamoo proves that to be a queen you need to be able to shine on your own and they did just that
=
They are such professionals Solar almost fell but she caught herself and really quickly fixed herself. Amazing 
=
ARTIST: MAMAMOO
SONG: DESTINY
GENRE: MAMAMOO
=
Oh my girl: at the top
(G)-idle: as they are the top
Bom: 'cause she was the top
Aoa: knowing they're the top
Lovelyz: for the top
Mamamoo: for their fan
=
Lol but this definitely look like their own concert
=
Queens 
=
I’m soooo excited to see them perform this on MAMA. I’m sure it’s going to be 10000x lit 
=
Hands down no question to why they won. Just looking at this already proves whatever questions you have to why
=
when solar tripped and almost fell, i’m glad no one noticed and they still won lol
=
Kill this love but Mamamoo
=
After watching all the performances I realised why MAMAMOO stood out. No doubt every other performance was excellent, given the choreo, music, costumes and especially the props and background dancers, but MAMAMOO was the only group which performed not as a team, but as friends. Their skill in impromptu stage antics, 'blink-and-you-miss' moments, ability to engage the audience and real talent in harmonising on stage (and not with the original track) made them so different.
=
Auténticas Artistas , min. 2:41 esa parte me encantó
=
EU DIGO ROM E VC DIZEM POM POM
ROM!!!!!
=
Omg solar almost tripped again 3:02 hope she's ok
=
四姐都霸氣又炸掉舞台。
=
Too much for me!
Speechless!
