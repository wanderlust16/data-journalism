she's not competing. she just giving us a free concert of her... this is pure art . very classic
=
can i just say this? Bom doesn't even need to win this show to prove her self. she's a QUEEN, before and now. the views, scores don't matter.
=
I can only cry because bom is alone and i know she wish her members where there
=
I think Bom is trying hard not to cry that's explained the parts that are not so stable. I mean it's even hard to talk while crying, how about singing
=
She doesn't need to win, she's already a winner in our heart and she's forever a winner, a Queen. We love her forever ❤ #foreverblackjack ❤
=
Only her that she’s 2nd generation in this competition 
=
The fact that she was sick and still sounded so good- now that's talent!
=
Almost 10 years later and this remains as one of the best kpop songs ever.
I can’t describe the nostalgia I feel every time I listen to it.
Park Bom, thank you. BlackJack forever.
=
She doesn't need to compete, she doesn't need to win, she's already a queen and she's just there to show the rest of the teams how it's done!
=
She's in the different level, she's just standing in the stage and doing nothing but her presence say it all
=
I don't hate MNET why she didn't win and why she ranked 5th placed, but i am very thankful to them that they invite bom to participate on the survival show. Proven mnet really was trying to help bom gained her fans again and ace her to the top. The only solo artist to be in the show was really amazing and breathtaking because she is already a queen thankyou for the MC who always put bommi on the fullest and scares contender in Queendom. agodblessBoM i hope knetz will love her and support her no matter what she was definitely trying to do her 101% Best! #ThankyouMNET #ParkBom
#2NE1Forever #Bomshells #TheOneAndOnlyVocalUnique
#QueenInKpopHistory #Legend
=
When the back doors open i thought dara, cl, minzy will appear. 
=
A queen doesn’t have to compete for no crown.
=
nobody can sound like park bom she’s on another level
=
Am I the only one who cried at the end of the song?! Like hell! She's a legend.
=
this made me cry :((( i feel the sadness in her when she said that her performance would be great if they do that in a group (2ne1)
=
I feel like park bom is trying so hard to not cry ...
=
Almost 10 years in entertaiment Park Bom was stand solo artist and bring the name 2ne1 in the stage. I will proud she. I hope all member 2ne1 see this and i want their making comeback in queendom for suprise park bom
=
Bom don't need any special dance to capture everyone's heart. No offense to others who will dance. Just saying. Love you Bom always
=
The girl who said "are we in heaven?". yES GURL WE ARE.
=
The new generation doesn't know what the meaning of talent, all they care & know is about visual, this is the real meaning talent, i love park bom unnie, you can do it alone, pls bring back 2ne1, gambateh!!!
=
i love her so much, like everything about her is beautiful even when she speaks <3
=
been wronged, judged & unloved but proved she never deserved those. so proud of this beautiful woman. 
*everyone, Park Bom*
=
I really love how they admire Bom and at the same time worried because Bom will perform alone.
Solar and other girls reaction when they notice that Bom having a mic problem.
=
SHE DESERVE NUMBER 1 BUT SADELY THIS WORLD IS UNFEAR
=
why am i crying while watching this T.T
i'm not even her fan or BJ :/
i just....miss this song T.T
=
Having goosbumps all over my body and im actually, literally crying right now. So nostalgic, i miss 2ne1 ..
=
Is it just me who is kinda hopeful that the rest of 2ne1 will come up and sing with park bom?  I miss them!
=
even though she was alone without CL, Dara, & Minzy, but her charisma as a legend will never be defeated by anyone.. Who agree with me!!!! ✌✌
=
I love that quiet at first moment  like they see their mom is other person 
=
today, many seems to have forgotten about park bom, i really love her
one time she was very loved, the scandal ruined everything.
i hate yg entertainment, it's like they never cared about her.
her voice is so special, i'm now watching her on queendom, so sad that she's always ranking low, her you and i performance  was a rollercoster of emotions and memories and hann was lit , i really believed she was going to rank in the top 3 (and also, stop mnet making bom looks like she's bad).
she  seems different because of the plastic surgery but her personality, talent are the same.
stop sleeping on the main vocalist of 2ne1;
support her solo career, she really deserve recognition.
she still have that powerful aura around her, that charisma and magnificent stage presence
=
2ne1 Should Reunite And Debut On A Good Agency I Feel Happy For Park Bom Coming Back But I Feel Sad At The Sime Time
Cause She Only Performs Alone
=
"In every song if you get Park Bom voice, it gets better"-GD 
ParkBom the legendary vocalist
=
Seriously i cried for tis really miss the old era of kpop especially the 2 generations. Thank you Bom for singing tis again
=
She ran out of breath but damn This was soooo goooood why was she placed 5th???
=
When Lee Dae Hee said : *"From LEGENDARY GIRL GROUP, 2NE1 MAIN VOCAL'S PARK BOM-ssi"* 
I'm crying 2NE1 still a legend for Korean Industry.... Do you agree?
=
No matter what happens, even when the sky is falling down, I promise you that I'll never let you go. <3
=
That give me goosebumps too. She is Diva and no one kills her. 
Support her 4ever.❤️
=
This is so amazing huhuhuhu I remember all the memories of 2ne1 huhuhuhu i miss them very very very very much!!
=
She's still the Best a songstress who sings with her heart and soul bommi
=
You can see everyone was crying and surprised. Everyone got goosebumps and chills. Even if she didnt win, she did in our hearts.  Love you Queen<3
=
When a legend appears and everyone gets teared eye. I myself am loving this. Much love to Park Bom. ❤
=
Why am I crying!!!!

=
This song brought me back 10years❤️
=
OMG I LOVE THIS PART
3:40
She's voice is so strong!!!!!
=
who else had goosebumps all through this video ❤️
=
Teddy Park once said, "even if you shake the whole Asia, you won't find a voice like Park bom'
=
Okay, all of her performance is a whole another level.
=
Dara, Cl, Minzy, look at our Bom, she is gorgeous and stunning ❤️ I wish you gals can sing with her on stage.
=
Park Bom Is so cute XD I mean every movement and just her overall is so adorable ><
=
C"mon we need 5 millions ❤️
=
Bom 
PARK BOM QUEEN 
=
Our Queen brought us a legit religious experience at the end there!  I had to pause, grab the good headphones, and replay it over and over.  Moved to tears every time.   T_^  #BlackjackForever
=
I've moved to tear already...
=
I love her so much.... 
Is it just me who's curious why the former trainies of produce x 101 here? Why are they here? Can anyone answer me?
=
BOM is trending on Melon and Naver 
#1 and #2 after this performance
=
this is making me emotional
=
Ahhh why I'm crying brings back so many memories , feeling nostalgic ❤️ I miss you 2ne1 soooo....much and the chorus at 3:13 like in heaven 
=
Listening to Bom sings this makes one feel uplifted and blessed. She's trully a Diva!
=
When you still hoping for the Comeback of the 2ne1 
=
i think she’s a bit nervous, but still you go Queen Bom!
=
U made me cry! Singing with so much emotions. U have so unique talents all 2ne1
=
This song brings back a lot of memories ♥
=
I never heard this song before, but i cried listening to this... This song has some feeling that touched me
=
She cried ❤❤❤
=
Always support you Bom big hug for you
Ahhh im in tear 
=
i miss her old voice :(
=
I remember my childhood days :> this serves as my remembrance
=
*I miss her and 2ne1 damn* 
=
The fact that every group is captured and mesmerized by Park Bom shows how much of a legend she is.
=
Why am I teary eyed watching this??? 
=
her voice totally eargasm. our queen parkbom.
=
I played this on repeat for weeks when I was in high school. Nostalgiaaaa! 
=
the way i love her voice sm:(
=
Just imagine park bom making it to the finals and 2ne1 regroup  ❤️
=
That was so amazing, I had to really try not to cry!!!!!! THE CHOIR WAS INCREDIBLE!!!!! almost took me over the edge
=
Demn! this performance makes my tears falls.
I miss the old daysssss
=
OMYG MY HEART ❤
=
The last time i heard this was over 8 years ago and im   crying for hearing this again
=
Finally i can hear this song again after a thousand years 
=
I get full body shivers whenever Bom sings, I'm so happy to see her doing so well. I get all teary eyed every time she preforms
=
So happy to see her on stage like this again after all she's been through. Happy tears.
=
The ffeels  Park Bom is such a queen 
=
Crying my effing eyes out... This entire journey and the nostalgia combined just brought out all the feels 
=
This made me cry :( way to go Bom! #BlackJackForever!
=
This was sooooooooo fking sick  I gonna faint from how Fire this is 
=
Im crying…My Queen is comeback!!
=
Who else sang the whole song with Bom?? 
=
For someone who has been there since 2009, I can’t help but to get teary-eyed. For Bom being able to do this considering the backlash she received in the past, it takes a lot of courage. This might not be her best performance but this is one of the many stages she will showcase her talent from now on. We’ll continue to support Bom and the rest of our 2NE1 Queens. 
=
queen in queendom - bom :*
=
I think she was having mic probs theres a part she signalled and pointed at her mic
=
Fans watching must be feeling like they're in a concert because of this performanceee.
=
this song makes be cry - i remember the MV
=
thye didn't put it here but, miyeon said she was about to cry at the end
=
The perfect moment to cut onions ...
=
3:34  ...."Are we in Heaven" ...lol
=
The mems 
=
Park Bom enter this competition as solo, but brought a whole cast of choir group hahahaha, that's my queen. 
Anyway, this song never failed to make me cry, esp with Bommie's angelic vocal!! T_T
This song is damn hard to sing......the original key is way too high hahaha~~~
at 3:10 timestamp there's 3 lights focusing on Bom, signifying blessing from dara, CL, minzy T_T
=
I'm crying rn 
=
If 2ne1 decide to comeback as 4 member group... Even without label they will still rock the stage...
=
Wow! That’s Queen , LEGEND Level !
=
I may have just cried my eyes out
=
Just by the thought that PARK BOM (thru 2NE1) touched each of these girls' lives and somehow affected their eagerness and choice to become the great idols that they are today is just something amazing. Experience wise, Bom is already the queen of this show. Just remember how many times she was rejected by YG before finally entering the company as trainee and finally becoming a member of 2NE1. With all of the controversies she and her group had been through, she's already a queen indeed, a chunk of coal that did really well under pressure and here she is now, a diamond of KPOP. 
=
let's get this one to *5M* FIGHTING!
=
I was sobbed and cried when I heard her singing in this song. I'm really glad to see Park Bom is comeback. i miss you and 2NE1 so much!! ❤️
=
Other groups are reminiscing aweee
=
Hope one member of 2ne1 will join her in her upcoming performances...
=
this brings back everything! i can feel that she's about to cry but she slayed! it made me cry when the crowd started singing with her, she's not alone! ilysm queen bommieee!
=
That was so emotional 
=
I cried. I'm so happy to see you singing again, Bom! 
=
We missed you Park bom
=
Even shes alone on the stage she knows that all her 2NE1 members and ofcoz blackjack always be with her. Unnie hwaiting!!!
=
This song always made me cry, 9 years ago till this day
=
Goosebumps.  My Queen. 
=
Yaaas bommie unnie! I missed this song 
=
I LOVE PARK BOM SO MUUUUUCH! BUT ANWAYS WHO'S THAT GUY IN 3:56 COZ DAMN HE'S SO CUUUUTE!
=
most of the girls is my age. this song i frst heard when i was in highschool.  so this song probably everyone childhood song.
=
2:38 look reaction solar what do you think about this?
=
I'm so happy she deserve more my bias ❤❤❤
=
Dust inside my eyes....
=
TTvTT feeling relieve and happy when I heard this song again  always support 2NE1
=

=
THE POWER OF PARK BOM SHE GOT EVERYONE EMOTIONAL ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I am a SONE, and all I want to say is that I hope the blackjacks give BOM all the support she deserves. A legend from a legendary group!
=
Park Bom, never stop following your damn dreams. I don’t know what would’ve been of me if I never came upon your mesmerizing voice. Even though this performance was below your standard you still managed to bring so many memories. It’s amazing how many miles differentiate us but you’ve done so much for me. Thank you my forever bias
=
I’m gonna cry when hearing about this,I miss 2ne1 everyone
=
I love this Mariah Carey moment going on
=
It’s almost 10 years , but for me this song is still my favorite song .
=
I want to go back to the paaaaast! 
=
I wish Bom perform "GOODBYE" Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
=
Why do I feel like MAMAMOO is rooting for Park Bom! ❤️
=
i miss 2ne1❤
=
Forever a queen ❤ made me feel so nostalgic and emotional. I wanna go back to the early 2000 kpop times so bad  (2ne1, Bigbang, 2pm, 2am, Suju, snsd, shinee, beast, mblaq, infinite, kara, afterschool, wonder girls, etc.) LEGENDS and the gateways to kpop.
=
wtf is this real her voice sounds so freaking good even on live
=
She started to sing I cried hahahaha omg
=
She was about to cry oh my lord this is so pure and beautiful
=
I love this so much because it's just her raw voice and the choir..  Thank you gravely Bom-unnie for coming back to us.. BJs forever~
=
Remembering Early Childhood

2:12 was it Baekjin? the one with red hair? From Producex101, ITS BAEKJIN TIMEEEE!! I MISS WATCHING Produce Series uwu
=
I love this song so much .... 
=
This song is legendary. It brings back so many memories!  It'll always be Bom's best song,  probably
=
Bom fighting, I'm very emo now
=
I’m rlly having that 0.01% of hope in me that 2NE1 will be able to use this reality show to comeback together... seeing this made me cry so bad because all the past 2NE1 memories came back and thinking about how it’s been so Long since she debuted solo with You and I, it just hurts to see her alone. Yet I’m so proud of her being so brave as the only soloist in this Reality show.
anyone that thinks the same, press that  button. 
Edit: Thank you guys!! once again rlly rlly hope that 2NE1 can use Queendom as a stage for their comeback performance!!! I rlly think that it’s the perfect reality show, perfect stage. Nothing Beats Queendom being their perfect stage.
=
I just need 2ne1 to reunite again 
=
I Love this song so much!! And the treatment they gave it! Chills
=
I’m crying
=
I am crying ❤
=
We love you PARK BOM ❤️❤️❤️❤️

=
I'm crying now, sister, I miss u so muchhhh. Listening this song takes me back to the time i was school. She's my youth
=
there's so much emotion in this performance... **cries in the corner**
=
I can only imagine how happy and proud Teddy, and the rest of 2ne1 with this Bom’s performance. Maybe they were also crying especially Dara. 
=
*A queen and a legend.*
=
I MISS MY QUEENS :(((((
=
I got goosebumps listening to her voice ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
That 3 spotlight in the mid break is like the 3 members of 2ne1 shining down on Bom!
=
one of the first kpop song that I can sing along with from beginning to end...  I used to write the lyrics in my school notebook back then
=
I miss 2ne1 
=
Queen Bom! 
=
1:04 isnt that sihun from pdx 101? (kinda looks like him)
=
She stands out really! Even without moving!
=
I cry until the end... I missed thm sm
=
This is the song that introduces me into Park Bom & 2NE1
It was gayo daejun when she sang it with Taeyang
It was my first gayo after all and I cried seeing her on mainstream stage again
My precious campus life filled with 2nd gen kpop 
How time flies 
=
Come on mnet invite minzy cl Dara, and see what's going to happen, let's all recommend it, let's do it
=
Man I thought this was a CD recording, but then I remembered this is Park Bom & she is just that amazing. Song brings back memories

How many Park Bom fans Here in the philippines? I start to 1 !
=
They were all reminded that they were in the presence of a real queen. I love most of the current generation group but it’s just a different vibe with the 2nd gen, they’re legendary. I’m suddenly missing 2NE1 all over again.
=
 I missed 2ne1
=
Her performance makes me cry. This is how professional she is even though the mic is not working properly still she sang her song..
Missing 2ne1 here 
=
I believe this is how they welcome you in Heaven.
=
Thank you MNET for those 3 lights behind Miss Bom.
=
3:57 is he is an idol?
=
I felt like there's something wrong with her mic. I noticed her tapping it. And her voice was in and out. Good thing she pulled it through. 
=
I love you Bom❤
=
Park Bom is so professional, at 2:27 she states that there’s problems, but I barely noticed
=
I cried when the first "oh" came out Legendary girl group 2NE1 and legendary main vocal Park Bom. Love you forever.
=
SHE DESERVE SONG OF THE YEAR!!! KEEP VOTING OUR BOMMIE DEAREST BOMBSHELL AND BLACKJACK!!! MAKE OUR CANDY PROUD!!!
=

=
Beautiful!
=
*here we go again!*
=
There are a lot of China fans miss them also... 'Park bom you and 1' was on the hot search in weibo for whole day...
=
A legend indeed
=
I dont know why but just listening to this im crying in tears. I used to really love 2ne1 songs. And to see her singing this on the verge of crying she must be really miss being 2ne1 and singing with their fans again on stage.
2ne1 disband is a big lost in music industry. I really hope Knetz can appreciate and love park bom again.
=
All the haters will try to bring her down everytime but what they don't know is Park Bom is a powerful and strong woman with a big passion.She have fall once but she rise again with the power of her fans and her willingness to proceed what she passionate about.She always get support and love from all over the world!!! SHE IS SO LEGENDARY AND POWERFUL!!!!
=
好厲害
=
Legend 
=
Love bom 
=
I cried for 2 hrs rewatching this. My childhood, my goddess.
=
So, she’s once again proving that she’s in the wrong country. With that voice, she deserves to be known worldwide.
=
Why am I crying? 
=
i love you bom.Blackjacks will support you always..your already a Queen for us .
=
4am literally im sobbing , Park Bom own the stage again this is not for competing but own the stage like her own concert im really crting Park Bom ...happy to see you again onstage Queen
=
OMG...i'm crying....:((((
=
No one can beat park bom, and thier group 2ne1, thier legend, ❣
=
This made me ter me up sm
=
I miss you so much my bommie love from philippines☺
=
Bom never failed to slay. Even she's now a solo singer. She claims her own throne. And protects her crown in her own way.
=
Gosh it brings back a lot of memories
=
scream blackjack!!
=
I wonder if all of Big Bang members and 2ne1 watched and cried w/us  Park Bom, we all love you 
=
3:29
She looks so confident
I miss it
=
I MISS U 2NE1
=
I just realized how much I missed 2ne1. FUUCK YOU YG
=
I think they opened the doors because they showed 4 columns of lights, like the number of members that were in 2NE1 and they keep them on until the end. Now she is a soloist but she always remembers her group, this presentation made me cry, I'm not blackjack but I have always loved Park Bom's voice and the love she has for all members in 2NE1 is really beautiful.
=
I was like "Oh wow!" for the whole performance. The stage was made for Park Bom and its so mesmerizing to see such a legend sing an emotional and powerful song. Applause to everybody who made this wonderful stage for Bom. ❤
=
Her voice is so unique. We know that it’s her voice although we close our eyes. Always love and support her. Let’s make her know she is not alone.
=
Legendary
=
I need G-dragon to come and said this again " when you put park bom in a song then it became a good song" .. sadly she is bit weaker in her voice,always seem like she hardly to control her voice and  breathing.
=
for a second i thought 2ne1 was coming out when the doors opened i almost had  a full on heart attack
=
So. Much. Feels. :’( #parkbom #2ne1forever
=
2:28 she was tapping her mic I think somethings wrong with her mic and she was giving signal about it.
=
Ok. I'm gonna cry myself to sleep tonight
=
Gosh amazing performance
=
I was really trying not to cry because I'm not in the right mind to be dropping tears, but bom seriously made my eyes water. The song is so wholesome and you can't help but think about the old days and 2ne1. She did a fantastic job. I would have started to cry if I was her cause i would miss my girls. Good job Bom, we love you and always will love 2ne1 ❤❤❤ come back home 2ne1
=
Park bom and 2ne1 i love them all
=
Oh my God.!
=
Park Bom forever a queen❤️
#BlackJack still strong 
#Bomshell strong 
2nd generation = gold 
=
A whole vocal queen
=
This show should be call “queenbom “ .
=
Anyone heard the fanchant? MAYYYGOOOOOODODDDD THANK U KOREAN FANS!
=
Yeah bom go go go!!!
=
I think bom's lymph nodes are acting up again, she's been holding her throat before she went up onstage. Some parts were sang with difficulty but the overall emotion and impact of the perfomance is good
=
When she said the intro took her back to middle school, I felt that 
=
She’s already a queen period
=
Park bom! Waeyo? 
=
ฟังไม่ออกนะพูดจริง แต่ดันร้องไห้เฉยอะ 
=
Hwasa looks like she's about to cry 
I wonder how it feels to be in a show with your idol!! #2ne1forever ❤️
=
I came here from bom's hann performance and she did the 2ne1 hand sign now I'm crying harder watching this :(((
=
She's already a queeen
=
1:04....DiD I FwEakIn sAwbNmbOys?
=
I love you park bom ❤️
=
;_; ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Stages/production like these can only be pulled off my 2ne1.. i miss them so muccchhh!!!
=
the other groups reaction really are the worry for Bom because Bom feels like she cried because of the missing tone and lyrics (I thinks so) But I clearly know that Bom really miss 2ne1
=
Her legs oml
=
Park bom’s “oooohhhh” woke the sleeping heart of blackjacks all over the world.. it even woke the blackjack with in these girls...
Edit: i created a video for the blackjacks called “awakening of the blackjacks” because of this hahaha
=
I want to see 2ne1 again
=
I don’t understand a single word but this performance make me so emotional
=
Why im crying :< because of 2ne1 i became a kpop fan for 10yrs now :< Boooommiieeee 
=
there are some pdx contestants in the audience omg-
=
was it just me or could other people kinda hear her trying not to cry during it?
=
She's a LEGEND of KPOP, point blank period
=
I miss 2ne1 
=
when they disbanded i was so devastated thinking i wont have the chance to see her sing again. and now we're here. i am just so proud of you Bom!♠️
=
Wooow  love it ♥️
=
<3 <3 <3 <3
=
She's absolute man
=
2ne1
=
Me encantó! ☺️
=
3:58 
=
Damn, Park Bom is so untouchable, I mean... she sings like she is breathing. I'm so proud of her in so many levels.
=
3:57 ??
=
Am I the only blackjack here who cries watching this??. 
 
*cries han river*   #2NE1 #blackjack #BOM
=
Oh i realllllyyyy loves her voice like a angel
=
We love you Park Bom, we are all here to support, whatever it takes. We are all proud of you,  i miss u all "2ne1"
=
Come here to (G)idle cover
=
No one can ever copy park bom's voice. She has a very unique voice and i love it!
=
I always have to cry when i hear boms voice - especially when it has this sad color to it
=
If she do the same like a "You and I (Live 8.11.2009)" mybe she can be top 3..coz when she dance so cute..like's other group..
=
2ne1 comeback pleaseeeee
=
Question: " your thought about joining queendom as a group?"
Park Bom: i respected that. But i as good as the whole group performing 

*MY QUEENBOM* 
=
:((((((((((((( my queens, reunite pls pls pls
=
Keep streaming
=
Goosebumpppppps!!!!!! Oh Bom!
=
❤️
=
Love​ you​ 
Park​ Bom​
=
The only 2nd generation artist to be represented there. To be able to perform again (alone without her group anymore) after so many years of unnecessary hate by haters, Park Bom deserves everything!! Always stand by Park Bom!! #RealBlackjack
=
I FELT SO DAMN TORTURED! MY HEART IS FALLING APART! BOMMIE I LOVE YOU!!!! GEEZ I'M BALLING MY EYES OUT HERE 
=
I hope she could got a chance to sing "We Belong Together" and  "Forever with you" with GD and TOP. plus I want to hear her rap again .. Oh my!
=

#2NE1
=

=
ohhhhh god i cried HARDT
=
THIS PERFORMANCE REMEBBER ME OF MJ
=
Why I'm cry see it...i feel i really miss you
=
What a loss of this gg gen couldn't enjoy the moment of 2NE1...
=
❤
=
=
Pure goosebumps factory.. I love you park bom
=
if mnet ever bring cl, minzy, dara.. im so gonna cry like there is no tommorw.. really miss them! i love u parkbom!
=
Earlier today, I was singing and humming "You and I" while driving. It's one of those smooth cruising and a lovely song in my head. Bom, you never fail me. Love you! 
=
Love this song..
=
she’s was sooo cute at 2:25 when she points the mic to fix it.
=
I AM CRYING GUYS I AM CRYING
=
Im crying okay but im happy
=
We, Blackjacks are so proud of you.
=
Mnet always had the highest ratings with 2NE1. They better bring 2NE1 this show. She is good as solo but we need 2NE1. They didnt deserve disbanding because of rat YG.
=
Tôi nhớ các cô gái của tôi  2ne1 ❤❤
=
Park Bom y su gran voz.
=
เสียงเพราะเหมือนเดิมเลยย 
=
❤️
=
I don't really know why she's in the place, gurl she's singing it lived
=
She showed a lot of vulnerability.
=
cant 2ne1 reform back under P Nation? please!!!!!!!!!!!
=
I'm so glad Park Bom went on this show. Shes too talented and I'm glad she got to showcase her talents here even if she didnt win. Shes amazing and I hope the best for her!! Seeing her in this performance honestly made me cry. This song is one of my favourite song and I'm so happy she got to perform it again!
=
I wanna cry
Please 2NE1
=
Kalo park boom nyanyi tuh slalu aku tuh merinding
=
YG WAS SO DUMB FOR WASTING HER talent WHEN SHES THIS AMAZING
=
I haven't heard this song for a loooooong time. I miss you Bom! 
=
2:26 she is sending signal "mic has a problem"....
=
I think the reason she sounded choppy towards the middle to end was because of the mic. At 2:23 you see her tap the microphone as if she hears herself weird in her earpiece
=
Queen of vocals!!
=
She is so Wonderful!!
=
Try not to cry challenge miserably FAILED! 
=
I feel like its little bit unfair competing against new gen group with active fan based. Most of the old kpop fan are not active to industry anymore because of major changes.
=
We Park Bom’s international fans appreciate the English sub so much!!! Thank you  
=
=
Park Bom eonni ❤❤❤
=
Is this Park Bom solo tour?  
Cause it is
=
I dont understand whybthis came to be the fifth place. I watched all the performances but this does not deserve the 5th spot. SHE IS A LEGEND  and honestly she should not be joing Queendom, she should be judging. GO BOM WE LOVE YOU ❤
=

FEELS

Its only 1 member and im crying already what more if its 4 of them.. I miss 2ne1.. No matter what 2ne1 remains superior!! Fighting Bom!!
=
She sounds like she wants to cry. I really miss 2ne1
=
I came back here every day especially today after Bom&Jjung's performance. Bom is really an amazing singer. I hope that even after she cried people will finally vote her. She deserves more than those 5th places she has been getting.
=
Am crying don't stop meee
=
Park Bom with her unique voice..
I cry listening to this again. 
I miss her..I miss 2ne1 
=
Y seguimos reproduciendo ✨✨✨✨❤️
=
=
This legend doesn't deserve this type of treatment. Kpop you are dead for me.
=
=
♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
Amazing!!!
=
2:26
=
I'm a sone, and seeing park bom on this stage remind me of the day where 2nd generation standing onstage together  we got ur back parkbom and blackjack

=
Omg!
=
I'm crying
=
I feel like crying
=
Please MNET give her a microphone that won't affect/disturb her singing or just let her use her 2NE1 mic 
=
I'm crying Bom Eonnie
I really don't want to watch Queendom but here i am.... 
BECAUSE I KNOW IT BRING ME BACK TO MEMORY LANE.. THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ERA OF KPOP GENERATIONS..
=
Am I the only who's crying from the start till the end, I MISS 2NE1 SO MUCH 
=
I think she said that she will invite the other members of 2ne1 in queendom ..  can't wait 
=
If you cant marry the kpop idol then just marry theyre fanboy/fangirls(andaming pogi my ghad nakita ko )
=
Forever be our queen!! Blackjack!
=
Why is Bom even here? She's bigger than all this! Wow she's so humble and professional ❤️ Bom's  vocal is incomparable. No matter what she already won. 
=
I hope in her next performance here, she will be with any 2en1 members
=
i love you bom
=
:'3 :'3 :'3 :'3
=
THE LAST HIGH NOTE OMG SO POWERFULL

=
Love Forever 2NE1

=
I cried so hard while I was watching. Let’s go Bommie, we’re still here supporting our queen! 
Blackjacks its about time to vote for her. Show them how strong we are!

You and I is a really hard song to sing, hell even to lip syncing to it, but Bommie got soo much better after her great comeback❤️
=
Kangen 2ne1 
=

=
Watching this made me remember of how a blackjack i was (and i am), teary eyes and goosebumps
=
I was crying while typing this and listening to BOM. I MISS 2NE1.
=
my favorite song!
=
She is a true supertalented artist/performer
=
When I watch Queendom, I wish I see 2NE1 only one. That's a dream.
=
Damn I couldn't control my tears. I was riding a bus and watched this. 
This brings back all the memories. From the live performances, concerts, 2NE1 TV, and to all the times they've been together. I can't help but cry.
You did so well uri Bom. I love you since 2009. ♥️
=
She's everyone's Sunbae after all. 
=
im about to cry Y^Y
=
I am so proud of my baby BOM

=
NEED 2NE1 REUNION ASAP!!!!!! IT DOESNT MATTER IF FEATURING ONLY WITH CL/MINZY/DARA!!!!!!!!!! BUT FULL MEMBER MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
I'm so happy that Park Bom's getting all the encouragement. She deserves to be well known. She deserves to be back on stage. And she deserves all the love. Fighting!
=
imagine, Park Bom is in MAMA 2019 line up and this song was her performing (also spring). thats gonna be lit man!
=
oww i know you
=
after I've watched it ..I imagined what if it was the  2ne1 ..  i miss them so much 
=
#respect
=
Omfg, I remember belting this song out in my room when I was 11 years old, I’m 20 now, time really flies
=
Bommie has one of the most unique voices in all of Kpop. I'm so glad she's finally back.
=
It's just me or Park Bom look kinda tearing up a bit during the performance? It make me want to cry.....
=
I hope she knows how special she is and how much love THE WORLD has for her I swear it's still 2012 she looks amazingly beautiful and as happy as she is on stage how much happier are we as her fans to hear her voice again !!!!! 2ne1 forever in our hearts and minds
=
omg never thought i would see this song's live again after all this year and here i am, crying fr
=
I think Mnet should apologize to Bom and the Mnet audience for the microphone signal disturbances (blurring and cutting). Also, they should officially describe about this event. I found out at least 10 times of significant errors. I guess that Bom herself must have felt a lot more. Just imagine how it bothered her. Bom did tap-tap the microphone and took a rest for a phrase without singing (I think it was a signal for mic error, mic change, or music stop). It seemed that Mnet decided to proceed the music without any changes. Mnet is really thinking that they would cover their critical mistake without any apology or official announcement? In Korea, many people are shooting criticism about Bom's poor vocal cause they did not catch mic error and they just think that the poor sound was  Bom's fault (shortness of breath and being easily out of tune). How pity.
=
=
=
Road to 2 Million! We can do it Blackjacks and Bomshells! ♣️♠️♥️♦️
=
2ne1 comeback stage please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
Love u forever love 2ne1
=
park bom cannot be compared to other groups. she's way up high. the girls looked up to her. She's park bom of 2NE1
=
=
wah kacau gua merinding
=
Competition should be fair
=
why can’t we just go back in time when we had 2ne1 missA fx girls generation girls day secret 4minute AoA 
=
2ne1 and SNSD including Jessica need to do the last performance as a gift for the fans who support them throughout the years.  I think the fans deserve it.
=
iloveyou bom
=
3.57 I LOVE
=
หน้าน่ากลัวมาก
=
Why the heck can’t mnet provide a working mic!? Goodness sake... so glad park Bom is an absolute vocal queen! Eff the cruddy mic!
=
I miss 2ne1 
=
im not crying, you are.
=
oh my queen.... watching u stand alone make me hurt. really miss 2ne1. real queen of kpop
=
=
why does she sound like she struggling to hit the notes
=
Great as always, but I think imthat it would've bdsn better if the mic was not messed up 
Anyway, Damn feels! So much goosebumps 
=
My Queen
=
I miss 2ne1......
=
2NE1 forever
=
I cried so hard omg I love you bom 
=

=
Imagine ? One of park bom performances they are complete 2ne1 who will perform in that stage .. kyahh .. can't wait hehez .. ( The mystery secret of park bom is to perform along with other members of 2ne1 in that stage ) that's her key .. Legendary performance  
=
=
Hồi bé nghe bài này dù không hiểu gì vẫn thấy hay vc
=
i am literally crying rn !(((( and this is like my 917392728938th time watching this
=
I think Bom is trying hard not to cry ! ... 
we love you,Bomie
=
A queen does not compete...she dominates. Yyaaaassss!!!!
=
Imagine the audiences are the real kpop stan since early 2000s... Bom would prolly be winning on this and will surely stay on 1st place. But Bom will stay Queen and Legendary. She be winning since her debut anyway.
=
=
Hearing this song again made me cry at the very end because Park Bom has come a long way and she deserve all the recognition that  she’s receiving now. I’ve seen her at her best, I’ve seen her at her very low but best of all I’ve seen her rise once more. Black Jack Reunite!
=
i just missed 2ne1 so much, i cried uugghh
=
I MEAN LITERALLY... EVERYONE SANG TO THE SONG IN THE STUDIO!! THIS IS THE POWER OF A TRUE QUEEN
=
When everyone is singing edm but park bom is just pure angel vocals
=
Still hoping Park Bom unites 2ne1 on-stage in the last episode. It's gonna be game over.
=
Even though I know that there are a few mistakes here and there, I can't stop coming back to watching this video! I feel chills every single time and I really feel her feelings from the song!
=
Wowww. We're 4M now. Good job to all Bomshells and Blackjacks.
=
She has to win she deserve that. 2ne1 made a lot of merit that today’s kpop’s fame
=
b!tch i’m crying  who with me?
=
I really got goosebumps listening to her voice... Really miss 2ne1 
=
This made me so emotional 
=
Her voice is so unique and beautiful.
=
Yaaaassssssssss brings so much mementoes 
=
OMG IM CRYINGGGGGGG
=
Watching this makes me cry I know she is hurt and feeling lonely she's trying not to cry but as a fan of her and 2ne1 I cried a lot miss u bomie
=
3:56 Masterclass from Gen.2 leaves Gen.3 speechless.
=

=
That was so beautiful I cried at the end... Woah.. ✨
=
I remember seeing this live and just being brought to tears. Completely unexpected on my part, because Minzy is my bias, but boomie had me shook <3
=
when i heard her voice in the beggining it gave me goosebumps since it's been so long since i heard the song.
=
So many memories with this song..bom, you singing feels like you close to my heart. You sing from your heart you own the stage bom you compete with yourself. when the world against you. That's how you do it bom

I think Mamamoo wanted to be in the front row audience singing with Bom.
=
I am crying at this performance omg all the memories came up and brought me into tears you deserve the world, park bom
=
Keep streaming
=
This literally makes me cry  It really triggered me more to miss 2ne1.  You really did well, Park Bom. ❤️

=
Road to another million views!!!!
=
Why am I crying  I MISS 2ne1
=
I'm so happy she gets to perform in this kind of shows that it's making me cry T___T Bom's passion for singing and performing shows. You can see how 2ne1 loves to sing and perform you feel it even if you are not there watching live.
=
I literally goes like this .
QueenBom your performance was so touching & nostalgic. You were there alone in that stage,but then there show your back up singers. It was like YOU and all the Blackjacks  behind you singing along. Fighting!
=
i hope mnet will also create a show/project reuniting disbanded legendary groups and make them perform again.. it will be a history
=
I literally crieed.  Her new company is so nice to her
=
just imagine when the door opens, one by one, CL, Minzy and Dara appears while singing as a background singer and then suddenly along with Bom they would sing the song with her as 2NE1 
=
Whenever 2ne1 or one of them’s performing it will always feel like a concert.
=
Seeing the views went up really quick means the rest of the blackjacks all over the world are waking up?
=
=
Why i'm cry
=
im not cryin over this omg
=
I burst out into tears when her voice came out.....Park Bom and 2Ne1 are just literally one of the best idols that exist in the kpop industry.....those memories with the girls really hit me hard with the feels
=
I really thought other 2ne1 was gonna show up :((.
=
My childhood song 
Her voice still and really amazing
=
Malaysian Bomshells and Blackjacks where you at?? ❤️
=
Hi Mnet! This video surpassed 1M views. That’s 1 out of 4 of 2ne1. What more if 2ne1 is complete? Please make them reunite in your show. This could be a hit!  You made it once in 2015. Please do magic, sorcery, witchcraft or whatever you call it to make this dream happen.  I’m begging you. 
=
I genuinely loved this performance. Although it wasn’t perfect because of the mic issues and her occasional straining while singing. She gave it her all and commanded the attention of everyone in the audience. I believe that what makes a singer great. You can have outstanding vocals and no presence on stage. But, if you don’t have stage presence your performance on stage becomes one dimensional. Being a singer is more than just vocals it’s a visual art as well. My former choir director said something similar regarding stage presence to me before but, I never understood what she meant by that until now. Park Bom made me realize that through this performance.
=
She‘s so slim but why her clothes doing her like that? But once a queen always a queen
=
21
=
=
Only her alone for all of the other member....blackjacks we can help her....
=
Bài này thật sự là huyền thoại!!!
=
Just crying for Park Boom while listening to this song! Think abt her career n myself!! Since i was a girl, i was super love her voice!!! Now, i cant believe my queen comes back!! Tears keep dropping
=
Why am i crying??? This song gave me a lot of memoriesTT
=
this is what missing in this gen. the vibe of best vocalist and their stage presence. wish 2ne1 reunion soon!
=
Omg But everyone was cheering so hard I’m so proud of our Bom she deserves so much love ❤️
=
This is an emotional performance  
When you're about to perform after bom but you cried because of her performance so you have to retouch 
=
I literally tearing up without any hesitates.  I miss 2NE1 so hardddd
=
I’m crying so much when the people in the background came out. I want 2ne1 to come back, please YG!! They deserve so much recognition. It breaks my heart to watch only Park Bom standing alone, I want to see them together. 
=
when I see bom, I just want 2NE1 members do like this activity lmao xv
=
This gone underrated  
Other groups has more views
=
I feel sad to look at her singing alone on the big stage 
=
This made me emotional  thank you Bom for coming back ❤️ #2ne1FOUREVER
=
I ain't gonna lie I started tearing up when she started singing  I miss 2NE1

Honestly. She's so different from A LOT of new artists and IM IN LOVE WITH THAT. It's so special to her. Her voice and everything. It sounds so youthful and yet filled with....ugh i dont know how to explain it. I haven't really seen much of her singing but it's precious.

I always play 2nd gen song in my shop/store. I love this song so much, I repeat it too often. Youngsters walking by always like what Kpop is that? Like hello its Queen Bom

Newer kpop fans don’t know how we feel about our queens
=
No one can replace her
Also 2ne1
=
=
If Park Bom becomes invited in MAMA this year, I bet she'll bring other 2ne1 sisters.
=
she's so brave to stand alone in this stage singing that song which has so many memories attached to it. i hope we can witnessed another comeback this year. in 2019 she appeared more than in yg years
=
=
Let’s face it we all cried through this!! She’s coming out on top (regardless if she wins or not). 2019 is BOM’s year!!

Tolong ini merindingnya sampe ke otak

=
Wtf MNET give her a proper mic I can hear the mic is not working well and ruining her performance ‍♀️
=
=
KKKKKKK
=
I feel like bom is fighting more than anyone in this competition. SHE is all alone but standing tall. Every time she performs here I just feel so proud of her.
=
I miss them
=
Even the other contestants recognized her song and been a fan of her.
=
Bom we will always love you
=
Cant help but think she worries about her mic. There was a moment when she tapped it. Good thing nothing major happened. Suguhaesss~
=
O my god...i'm crying with her voicefeels like it's been so long missing 2ne1
=
I was long time ago when i heard that everyday and cry a lot with the music video
=
Just so you all know, she was having a problem hearing herself that's why she kept reaching around her back. She was trying to adjust her in-ear monitor. She even pointed at her mic at around 2:24 to signal the audio crew. :)
=
Park Bom be like: Hey 3rd Generation Groups, this is how a 2nd Generation Main Vocalist sounds like. 
Gaaaaahd!!! Her vocals never changed at all!! And i've missed her singing so much!!
=
All I can say is "Goosebumps". Woaahh the Chills! Keep fighting Park Bom! ❤️
=
Simple yet jaw dropping. Huehue
=
My Bommie never fails to give chills on everyone.  Her voice is a blessing from the heaven.  Keep fighting, Bommie!  We are here to support you!  We love you!
=
This is a historic stage in Kpop history, already.
=
2:27 her mic was having some issues, she's so professional handling problems on stage
=
Only kind hearted people and cool will stay for her.. Others with unpure soul can leave and will be cancelled. TQ
=
Whenever I hear Bom sings, I feel like Dara, CL and Minzy are with her.
=
ITS OVER FOR YOU BITCHES WHEN 2NE1 COMES BACK
=
Weren’t mamamoo and Bom on a team together? Or was she joking? 
=
See you in the Philippines this September QUEEN. Hoping you sing this song or perform Spring with Dara. 
=
I really want to have english subs for this. I wanna know how the other groups appreciate Queen Bom
=
go boomie
=
Im hoping for a surprise that all of 2ne1 can gather again together and perform on this stage
=
Among the 6 participants of Queendom,  Park Bom has the biggest international fandom (Blackjacks and Bomshells). We are outside Korea, so we can't do voting nor attend one of the queendom episodes. All we can do is stream her videos on youtube because it has an impact and points as what the criteria of the contest says. So please let's stream her videos uploaded by Queendom,  let's support and help her. Nolza!
=
You don't know you miss it until you listen to it... #BOM ❤️❤️❤️
=
I love you.
=
go park bom
=
I was in mid school when i heard this song & now i'm mom to my son & still can't get enough of this song ❤
=
*BOM*
*DARA*
*CL*
*MINZY*
*2NE1*
*BLACKJACK*
=
my first kpop grup that i love is not bigbang nor snsd but it is 2ne1. and i love them so much.
=
Why i'm crying
I'm so proud the legend park bom fighting!
=
I got it. That's how kpop world is, right now. As long as they like you they will support you. How sad. If that is the case why they should have to perform if in the end its up on how many people will support them because they know them but not because they are more talented and have a great performance than others. But still it's okay as long as we see our queen Bom performing and enjoying on stage. Hope that she can bring her members .
=
OMG THIS SONG 
=
I was so sad when she got the 5th position
=
Our Queen come back 
=
I got goosebumps. I really miss seeing them performing togethwr :"(

Bom with her voice, both are so beautiful!
=
I have always and forever loved her! Dara and Park Bom are my all time female idol! While I still dreaming abt Daragon, Park Bom came back strongly and brought me back to all these beautiful memories :(. Why is it so difficult for them to be happy and successful??? They deserve better

Looking forward to reactions from the other members  or will there be suprises soon 
=
(G)idle and Bom
=
Soy yo o boom estaba nerviosa! :(
=
Just OMG

=
Queen Park Bom
=
omo i really miss 2ne1
=
We all know Park Bom is the queen
=
I LOVE IT
=
I can't wait for next episode
=
Why whyyy ,, suddenly so sensitive. 
=
the real queen
=
Rosé covered this on the Blackpink tour, I just realised
=
❤️
=
เสียงแบบนี้มีคนเดียวจริงๆนะ ถึงหน้าจะเปลี่ยนแค่ไหน แต่เสียงไม่มีเปลี่ยน โตมากับ 2ne1 เด้
=
Make me crying
=
=
She's very confident and comfortable in this performance. My Queen!!!!
=
I hope Bom will bring 2NE1's stage on this show
=
Why did I feel sad and cry when she was standing on the stage to perform alone?.. I miss 2ne1 
=
When the thing open I thought the other members will come and perform together and my heartbeat beated fast!! But I was wrong but I had feelings the group is gonna perform together later
=
If 2NE1 join at Queendom, what do you think will happen????? ✌✌✌✌
=
3rd generation groups still have so much respect for 2nd generation singers  ITS SO BEAUTIFUL 
=
Cl should leave yg, collect her girls and together conquer the kpop industry.
=
Aaahhh Bomie!!! Why am I crying while watching this? This song brings back a lot of memories! I miss the girls so much  #Proud #Blackjack
=
2ne1 2019 pls!!!!!! 
=
MNET, PLEASE REUNITE 2NE1 ON THIS PROGRAM!!!
=
I'll always be grateful of D-Nation for helping Bom get back up to her feet and sing again. Thank you so much
=
Queen!!
=
ทำไมหน้าบวมจัง
=
Im cry :'(((((
=
You and I together ❤️❤️
=
I had to swallow back tears.. who cut onions in here :,( my girl Bommie deserves this and so much more 
=
please come back 2NE1  ... IM Madly crying
=
This song is really nostalgic. It reminds me of my childhood when the Internet wasn’t available in my area yet and the only way to listen to this song was waiting for the radio to broadcast it. I don’t even remember how much time I spent every night beside my little radio hearing this song before going to bed. Now everything has changed but it’s still broken-hearted to see 2NE1- a legend Kpop girl group disbanding. There are many unique girl groups currently, but basically none of them gives me the feelings that 2NE1 used to.
=
Did BJs really stop streaming all of a sudden?!
=
I cried when I heard that first note  the Queen Park Bom
=
I feel like crying too!!  I miss 2NE1!
=
O:01 wow it's feel like nostalgia
1:12 i don't cry, really
=
Can’t wait next eps when she cover another group 
=
I'm so sorrry, I cried so much 
=
For the whole duration of this video, I just legit cried to my heart content. I really miss the four of them performing. And everytime those kpop idols react backstage, my reaction was always "same girl, same". I really want 2ne1 to be together again. This perf was so beautiful and yeah, nostalgic. Go Bom!  OT4 #FOURever
=
Omg! Why am i tearing up 
=
Where can I see the full ep or know where to watch the clips from?
=
And i'm missing 2ne1 now:')
=
She's brave enough to stand and sing alone. 
=

=
First video in queendom get 1m views 
It's park bom
=
BLACKJACKS and Bomshells still support our QUEENS❤️
=
She may be an adult woman but I could feel like she's innocent as a child. She didn't deserve all those toxic comments back then..anyway I'm glad she's rising again !
=
I cry.
=
I miss 2ne1
=
Is so hard not to be super proud and sad for her. Fighting for herself and battling through! 2NE1 lives forever!
=
I love how every artist there show their reaction
=
Am I the only one that hoped 2ne1 would appear when the lights turned off 
=
I'm not crying.. You are.. 
This gives me goosebumps 
=
Im elf, but im so proud of her :')
=
I was so afraid to saw this, I knew I gonna cry so bad. Being black jack of my whole kpop life, I am so proud of Park Bom. I love you so much. We are 2ne1! We are forever!
=
I am Taiwanese, this song make me cry, thank Park Bom, her beautiful voice,song,and story grew up with me during every sad, happy, memorable moments.
=
Awwww, amazing performance, brought me straight back to my secondary years, teared up for sure.
=
This is ma queen❤❤❤❤
=
The energy of 2NE1, is still in her. I just want to see 2NE1’s performance again. I really missed the moment
=
Trust me! My tears like the Han river
=
When I say I never cry to songs *I never cry* But this performance made me speechless and *I started crying at the end*
=
I just keep rewatching it because I just like how she sings . Love the song. The song is stuck in my head. Voice of an angel
=
I don't care about the competition, I just love her ♥️
=
You got this Bommie!!!! Show em how it’s done!!!
=
IM IN ACTUAL TEARS BYE YALL
=

=
The Queen has come to reclaim her throne.
=
You are queen bom!!!I love you girl!!!!
=
D legend Queen
=
omg you guys in the comments are all right. I wasnt even thinking about 2ne1. I thought I was over this, but somehow the tears still flow out my eyes 
=
Keep streaming
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
Love it !!!!
=
she is the definition of a fighter QUEEN.... never forget shes the 25% of 2ne1 yet her charisma  is on 100% on FIRE..... WHAT MORE IF THE OTHER 75% IS ON
=
why I'm crying listen this song.. eonnie miss u so much...
=
OMG Queen 
=
❤️
=
Who was that guy in 3:57?
=
<3
=
<3
=
I'm sure if they allow us intl blackjack to vote, the game is over!! Queenbom ♠️♥️♣️♦️ 
#FourEver

#Queen2ne1
#Nolza
=
what's wrong with the microphone?:(
=
Hoping dara, cla and minzy will join herits gonna be epic
=
Gosh time flies by too fast
=
love u bommie
=
4,000,000 Go...GOOO...Go... 
=
Lovely park bom
=
=
Any one else came from Rose cover ?
=
♥️
=
I miss her a lot
=
She just stands there.
=
I just started crying when she sang. The nostalgia hit me so hard. This is just Park Bom, imagine what would've happened if this was the whole of 2NE1. I miss them a lot.
=
1:03 That fanchant at the back make me cry.
=
=
2009
=
Even after such a beautiful performance. Bommie only placed 5th!? WTH is this voting system.
=
She did not deserve to be in 5th. This performance was iconic. She emoted her heart and soul into this performance and I can feel the depth. It may not be the freshest concept but she delivered it regardless. She deserved to be in the top 3 imo. However she looks like she is having fun. That’s all that matter to me. I’m just happy to see her sing and be happy.  ❤️
=
Most idols on this show grew up listening to the 2nd gen sunbaes like 2NE1, SNSD, Kara, Wonder Girls etc. This performance must mean a lot to them.
=
Legendary Girl Group will always be legendary no matter they are doing SOLO or as a GROUP.
=
สู้เขานะคะ #queenbom
=
#2 trending in korea , She is the only one with unique voice tone in kpop industry .
=
2NE1 Suprise Union plz

She is already a queen. No competition to define her.
=
2ne1 please come back
=
Try not to cry. I bet u can’t.
=
Im crying
=
i cried i cried i cried
=
She needs to gain confidence, and through this show, she gets it.. it doesn't matter if she didn't win, as long she happy
=
I love u BOM
=
I wasn’t a huge BlackJack, but I’ve always enjoyed 2NE1’s music & respect the legacy they left & how much they paved the way for the kpop community 
=
2NE1 miss

=
I cried because of this stage
.
Her voice is so beautiful to say a word.
...And i miss 2ne1...
=
I'm not a blackjack and  i've never heard this song before. But today i'm literally crying to this performance. Parkbom deserve better ❤️
=

=
YOU AND I 2019 VERSION 
GOOSEBUMPS ALL OVER 
I'M CRYING RAINBOWS 
WE SO PROUD OF YOU BOM 
MY BLACKJACK HEART IS FULL ♠️
=
ME LLORÉ LA VIDA ENTERA Y MÁS. TAN HERMOSA MI AMOR, LA AMO UN MONTÓN ❤️❤️
=
Those 3 Lights on 3:10 Part is like Cl, Minzy, Dara’s Soul and like its give a Power to Bom! 
#4Lights #2NE1 #Queen #PowerBOMb
=
As much as i want to say good things about this, i’m gonna skip that because I’ve been watching this nonstop! And i know i’m not the only one but.. hey! Keep watching till the end and keep on supporting park bom on this! Votes and views are big help for her!!!! Please lets all give this to her. I know it will increase her confidence more. Thank youu.
=
The power of Park Bom alone. 
I hope YG is choking to death for the mistreatment of 2NE1. I will never let this go, never.
#2NE1DeservedBetter
=
I really cried i couldn't control my tears. I wished for a moment that when the lights got off 2ne1 will be together on the stage again T--T ♥
=
when the mc introduced her as the main vocal of the legendary group 2NE1 i had goosebumps
=
Love you bom from Cambodia fan
=
Let's not lose hope!! 
WE WILL SEE A 2NE1 STAGE ON THIS SHOW!
=
Its not her 100%, but yet delivered an amazing  Performance. WHAT A QUEEN
=
Only a true queen and a legend can slayed a performance by just standing only.
=
Don’t care if they aren’t together anymore but I’ll still stay a blackjack and Park Bom still remains my ultimate bias.
=
I want my 2ne1
=
I'm cry
=
Her voice worth more than everything. Even she struggle with lymph nodes, she still sounds amazing tho. Im glad she sings again.
=
The cute guy in 3:56 is killing meeeeee!!!
=
SIHUUUNNNN 
=
I never listened to her music or 2NE1 but I really like her voice
=
Bring on online votes open to international fans. Let’s see then who’s the real queen  Lee Da Hee didn’t introduce Bom to be a LEGENDARY GLOBAL artist for nothing 
=
I literally cry every time she performs
=
This makes me miss 2ne1 soooooooo much, I'm crying omgggg, I rlly want 2ne1 back ❤ 
I love bom song soo much
=
2NE1 will always be my one and only ! I really want them together performing on stage. Please God make it happen. And Give bommie all strength to fight against this hate. 
Blackjacks this is only the way we can support park bom. Please watch this now and again.
=
This is so *NOSTALGIC* My childhood is suddenly CLICKING EVERYTHING
=
Its sad to see her alone :'(
=
Jsjs, me estoy chutando los anuncios para intentar sobornar al Mnet y a ver si le suben la puntuación a Bommie :v
=
The feels 
=
Love​ Bom​ forever​ ❤️
=
Hope dara or cl or minzy join her in queendom.. I really like the blending of their voices.. park bom voice is good but not attractive for me when she's on solo.
=
I think next she'll invite Dara to sing Spring .. I hope next Dara, there will be CL, Minzy & the complete 2NE1
=
I felt chills and I started crying. Power of park bom.
=
She's so amazing but i feel sad:((
#2ne1 #blackjack
=
My Beautiful bommie❤️
=
Remember when she used to be YG Vocal Queen in that era. This is so sad. Look how beautiful and shinning she is
=
Who else still streaming this??
=
*All of the other groups performance amazed me, but this one "Park Bom" really made me teary eyed salute QUEEN*
=
Keep streaming
=
Why I am crying?
=
i miss the old Bom from this song...
she is really so different that is it almost looking at a different person..
=
My Queen Park Bom
=
Always here waiting for live performance of Bommie!!!
=
i'm crying. miss them wish we can see them together in one stage
=
Park bom should in top 3
=
Out of 6 performance this is the most painful to watch... Its too painful to see park bom alone... N she need to sing the song in 2ne1 golden era... How she supposed to to feel up on stage... She must be fight against her tears to finished it... I pray u the best Boomie... U r awesome... Love the voice
=
I'll be honest. I was very nostalgic listening to the song, but after I heard it the second time, I listened to past performances and found that she's not entirely the same. She used to sing the same song with ease, but now she really needs to push it out.
=
Literally her first 10 seconds of vocalization in the dark made me want to cry. Damn that power 
=
Hi Yang Hyun Suk, yah watchin this?
=
where are you Blackjacks?? Park Bom is calling
=
LITERAL GOOSEBUMPS BOOOM
=
芊葉火鍋
=
This is si beautiful
=
Lo siento, pero no puedo evitar pensar en carmen de mairena cuando veo su cara JAJSJSJSJAJSJSJ
=
=
OH YES LIVE VOCALS
=
hate to admit, upon watching it again and again, im still tearing and hoping even 2ne1 wont perform here, but somewhere they will again, be back together
=
甘業火鍋
=
=
what is going on with the hairstylist??????? 
=
Stop my tears.....
=
LETS FO QUEEN! YOU SLAAAAY
=
The way I interpret the song right now, it seems like Park Bom Unnie is calling the rest of the members. Especially from the beginning of the performance. 
Park Bom doesn't need to win this show ( but it would be still great if she does and I pray for it), cause we all know that she is already a LEGENDARY QUEEN. 
For her, I know she's not there for competition but she just wanted to share her music, talent and most of all she just wanted to enjoy every performance she's doing. Lastly, I know she wanted to be an inspiration to others in not giving up your dreams. As long as you have it in your heart, you can still rise up and achieve it. 
God bless unnie. Hwaiting!!!!
=
Bom. It's so great to see her performing. Media really tore her down, but she's back and fighting. This song brings so much nostalgia. I love whenever Rosie covers it at concerts; no one can do it like Bom tho.
=
I miss 2nei1
=
I don't know, but this performance gives me hope, a lot of hope for a 2NE1 reunion, PLEASE MNET MAKE IT HAPPEN
=
C'mon guys road to 4️⃣ millions ➡️we can do it for our QUEEN   ❤️ #SPRING #PARKBOM #YOUANDI  ✌
=
I really love her, Hope to see 4 girls in stage 
Love Park Bom - Love 2NE1
=
i don’t get it....why she got 5th place but is trending on Naver & Melon? are those people who are voting smoke crack?
=
If only 2ne1 did not disband, it would feel so right to watch Queendom with their group in it.
=
1)bad lynph nodes condition
2)Shitty mic
3)gets emotional
And with all of this she slayed and ate the CD like a true
=
Our Queen come back!! i love how the rookies respect and cheered for her! we all teared up
=
PARK BOM IS A QUEEN, ok? ♡ 
=
Road to 1M views. Let’s go Blackjacks!  Please don’t forget to hit  button.
=
I suddenly cried
=
i like her voice,have a magnet magic attract me
=
0:52    1:05    2:12   3:56
=
I see baekjin
=
I was a Blackjack, has been since the debut of 2ne1. And when that scandal broke and then the disbandment, I was torn inside and  I just wanted someone to blame and I chose to blame you Park Bom without even trying to believe you. I hated you for years because I was immature and stupid. I know you will never forgive me and I do not want you to but I need to apologize. Sorry for not believing you, sorry for all the hate I had thrown at you, sorry for being stupid and immature as these are not an excuse to trash and hate someone. I believe that we have not yet seen the last of 2ne1, CL has now left YG and i think Dara will follow suit soon. I hope when that time comes, you'll be whole once again on the stage. Blackjacks will wait.
=
my QUEEN :'(  no ı'm not cryıng you are !!!
=
What if next reality show by m-net is Monster Rookie Dom (MRD)? 
Group is:
1. BlackPink
2. Twice 
3. Red Velvet
4. ITZY
5. (G) - idle
6. IZ*ONE
It would be awesome cz they have 2 groups from the same company.
=
Tem como não chorar ao ver a Bom sozinha no palco, impossível se segurar. Chorei o vídeo todo e ainda estou a derramar lagrimas. T.T, 2NE1 nunca morreu e nunca morrerá, não importa oque digam, sou Black Jack para sempre.
=
T.T you don't find that kind of voice often. It's beautifully rare
=
WOW
=
Who else expected cl to come out when the rap part starts
=
How many people agree that the FOUR fingers Bom raised as ending posture represent 2NE1 four members... Makes me wanna cry
=
cheetah appears.
soyeon: she's my trainer!
jimin: she was my enemy! (in unpretty rapstar)
=
Bom is such a great performer, you can tell she uses everything she has to entertain that crowd. And this is only 1/4 of the power 2NE1 held. I have so much love and respect for her.
=
Park Bom will release her comeback "First Snow" on December 10 feat. Sandara Park!
=
Minnie reacting to this be like


*I want some bom*
=
This is how many INTERNATIONAL fans park bom have

⬇️
=
Is it bad I like this more than the real ver
=
THE OTHER ARTISTS ARE EVEN HYPED WHEN BOM STARTED TO SING! AND THIS GOT 5TH?!
=
This would've been better if the whole 2NE1 came
=
I don't really care if she wins or lose...i'm glad she's back 
=
I mean she is a queen after all
=
They know we would have died if CL showed up for the rap part. So they got another queen instead.
=
I dont care about the ranking whats important is she showcase her talent thats all matters. 
=
I Love that she isn’t even trying, she just knows by heart how to please a crowd
=
The amount of Koreans in here should really go to support her when she perform
=
This is not a fair competition she deserve 1st on this performance
=
I was so disappointed by the rankings. She deserve better. I really don't think I will care now about the rankings. All I want is to see Miss BOM on a show.
=
This was the most trending song from queendom on iTunes and Apple Music. Queen BOM 
=
Bom is the only one performing and this performance is already epic. Imagine if Whole 2NE1 performed there it would be legendary
=
GDragon was right...Bom's voice makes any song sound better
=
Park boom means business. Shes not joking around.
=
I loved how she still kept her makeup style when she was in 2ne1
=
This is still the best performance Park Bom ever pulled off in this show.
=
Bommi's han is the cutest thing ever!
=
Bom really made this song like her own. Fking lit.
=
Bom’s on a whole nother level!
=
i feel like not enough people appreciated how good bom was in queendom❤️
=
Seems like she’s singing her own song here.
=
Queendom did her bad. She deserves MORE than this! She was a member of the most powerful group 2ne1! It was LEGENDARY and even as a solo artist she's standing strong! You can do it Bom! Fighting!!!
=
Park Bom has such a unique voice. Especially in Fire. Like no one can sing her parts
=
Chettah is soyeon's trainer in produce 101
Park Bom is miyeon's trainer in YG
And they're covering hann. Their students song 
=
Bom is better than them sadly to say but it's true!
=
This is how cover do. It has more sales than the original ahahahaha.. ranking is a shet. People know who can sell records
=
This and AOA's performance should have tied for 1St.
=
She sang it not like a cover but like it’s her own song. “Han” sounds like a whole new song but still with it’s identity. Love it
=
she's flashing 21 with her fingers at the end--just like Minzy did years ago at the end of her dance battle with hyuna, gain and nicole.
=
Bom really slay this performance ✨
=
She back wow....... Watch out girls it's gonna be tough in this industry cause she is here once again to rock the stage in her own way and style
=
The 2ne1 hand sign at the end, I might be crying. She's so talented, I love her so much 
=
I can't be the only one who thought she was gonna bring out CL!
=
I need a studio version of this 
=
Why I always cry when I'm watching her all performance hear.
=
When they said "those goosbumps" i felt that
=
imagine if it was “feat. CL” 
...

the internet would break
edit: thnx for the likes by the way, blackjacks powers are scAry aF
=
Honestly Bom is always amazing but she held her own when she competed against groups and adapted a group song to be a solo with a feature for the rep section. Adapting a song developed for a group is very difficult
=
SHE GOT 5TH FROM THIS??? THIS WAS SO GOOD
=
holy crap she owned the song I LOVE HER VOICE AND THE CONCEPT SHE WENT WITH
=
Who wants CL and Bomie for a collab ? 
=
She made this song like it was for 2ne1...that feel
=
Legendary is in God's level, how human can judge the Goddess?
=
Bom can literally make a girl group herself.
=
I’m getting nostalgic. There’s just something magical whenever Bom performs a song. The feelings she gives you >.<
=
tonight SCARECROW will be trending again...
=
We all know she should have won this competition , hands down . All the girls were her fans not her competitors
=
I think it’s safe to take queendom results with a grain of salt
=
*Bom should do concepts like this more*
=
When Cheetah comes out, I imagine that CL comes out rapping, Dara get a mid part and filling Bom's part as a backing vocal and baby Mingki dance till break the stage. 

=
This is Park Bom song now.
=
I don't know how many times I replay this hahahaha this feel like a solid solo comeback from her 
=
kpop is getting cleaned y'all, finally
=
I love Cheetah but CL would have bought the attitude to match Bom then YGE would have been shook.
=
Damn this is hot
=
I expected Bom's rank to increase for at least 1, I can't believe she get 5 again even though this performance is so good
=
I don't get why she even has to join this show. She doesn't have to prove anything else at all because she's already a legend. I mean, 2NE1 is already a legend.
=
Wow....when i compare how g idle sing this versus bom....bom version is singing with feelings...g idle dance choreo and voice remix...both are good...but i like park boom version..maybe because i love ability to sing than dance...applause for both...
=
I keep coming here. Like every days without failed
=
JIMIN’S REACTION WHEN CHEETAH CAME OUT ASKSKSK
=
imagine if 2ne1 is there, they would've eaten them all at once
=
The most v*ews (G)idle song, Thanks neverland for help my bom Alone in this show, (G)idle and Bom top one in my heart
=
I missed her so much! Growing up I always looked up to 2ne1 as my favorite kpop group. It's the group that introduced me to kpop. Their songs were revolutionary like fire and the solo Bommie did "you and I". You can do it bommie! Fighting!
=
This performance of Bom deserves more
=
4:10 does anyone here remember the sign in her right hand?
=
She’s the Korean version of Beyoncé 
=
It must be hard for Bom to sing a group's song alone but she killed stage.
=
bom looks so good here jesus chrisT
=
she’s so stable ‍♀️
=
I feel like watching boms solo concert. This is amazing! 
=
3:16 Hwasa in stunned silence-- don't forget she's a blackjack and cried when she got to meet Bom for the first time.
=
Queen park bom❤❤❤
=
Soyeon saying "Trainer Cheetah". ❤❤
=
I think this is her best performanceee on queendom
=
She did the 6 part perfectly her voice was powerful
=
I still cant get enough of this performance! It’s addictive ❤️
=
3:11 though... Cracks me up.
=
I am so freakin happy to see Bom back doing what she loves. Amazing
=
AMAZING❤️
=
Oh my BOMMMMMMIEEEE... I MISS YOU. 2NE1 SARANGHAE.
This is such a fantastic cover. Where's the studio cover on this one. I want to sing this. MAKE WAY FOR THE QUEEN. BLACKJACKS 4EVER.
=
The hand sign at the end!!!!! ❤️
=
Bom killed it. Sooo good!!!!! The song is perfect for her unique voice, and she sounded good (my fav. Part) when she sang the remember at the beginning. ❤️ Congratulations Bom.
=
The baddass female Park Bom is back... 
=
MY QUEEN, MY GODDESS, MY DIVA... I LOVE YOU!!!
=
When soyeon said it remind me of 2ne1...i be like yeah me toooooooo.who missed the queens .
=
This was the most trending song from queendom on iTunes and Apple Music. Queen BOM 
=
Bom need to release this type of song really suit her well .. i miss badass Bom 
=
When Bom cover a song, it will become her song.. She should make a studio version of this for real.. Damn it feel like a brand new song.. We cant deny her voice character change the song ambience..
=
Bom : bom bom bomi olkkayo 
Me : spring already back for you queen
=
Idle's reactions are so cute
=
1:39 nice playback. I love Bom tho
=
This is everything ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
3:38 my fav part that was so sexy and powerful
=
I can never get enough of Bom
=
I was expecting CL to come for the rap part, it would've been legendary but Cheetah killed it
=
Bommie is the cutest ever! never give up! T
he Best voice!
=
Win or lose, who cares. As long as we get to see Bom perform. She's already a queen regardless.
=
How i wish one of the 2NE1 member could perform with bom in this show!!!!!
=
Coming back here  love her version 
=
I really like this version.
=
I'm in loveeeee
=
Boom, I've been watching you since you've been struggling doing street performances for your album and I think you deserve this spotlight.
This is a woman that doesn't quit, RESPECT!!      
=
I didnt know G-Idle before listening to that performance and I thought it was her own song  Park Bom is the queen. It sounds like her own song.
=
Respect to park bom
The performance was legendary
=
Wow, incredible. Cheetah comes in like a bombshell. Bom, she carries a group song easily. When she is dancing with the camera live, that is incredibly difficult to do. Great cover, great performance. Park Bom for the win.
=
Stream this stage reach 10M views before Bom & Dara Comeback with new song "First Snow" 
=
*(G)I-dle* :WE ARE THE NEXT GENERATION, NO ONE CAN STO-
*Park Bom* :Jerry, Hold my watermelon.
=
SHE DESERVE SONG OF THE YEAR!!! KEEP VOTING OUR BOMMIE DEAREST BOMBSHELL AND BLACKJACK!!! MAKE OUR CANDY PROUD!!!
=
Let me just say Park Bom's dancers are just fierce.
=
Bom youre so so amazing, your voice is so âmzing 
=
Yeahhh. I am definitely convinced that Bom is no longer a dancer and to see her performing this uptempo song with choreography makes her look  out of place. 
Like, a Mariah Carey LOL
=
I can imagine how so yeon proud the song sing by a livin legend.
=
every single day im coming to watch this legendary performance cmon y'all IT'S PERFECT
=
they should change the show name from queendom to *queen BOM*
=
Imagine Dara walk through the door instead of cheetah walking in seconds later Minzy then finally CL 
=
OMG aku merinding setiap denger suara park boom 
=
Park Bom have unique voice, she still the best as kpop main vocal
=
She is one men as the whole teams, it is not fair at beginning. I am not complaining, I just want to say it is such a pity.
=
Blackjacks coming out from their graves upon hearing Bom's singing voice.. We protect and support our Queen!!
=
If it's CL who came and be Bom's guest it would be the end of the show! 
=
Wow kill The stage, perfect!
=
Cheetah has stage presence 
=
Just like G-dragon used to say about Park Bom “ every song she sing, it will become special ! “
=
Park bom❤️
=
I just noticed in every video i watch, whenever bom perform, there are people watching with mouth wide open...in awe??
=
G idle must be really honored for park bom to cover their song
=
Omg! It too late for me to see this. Park Bom is a real queen  Sorry for forget this fact in a long time. Now I will remember and support to you my queen .
=
2NE1 STYLE！NOLZA！
=
Damn, Park Bom your really a QUEEN  im really enjoying your performance QUEEN and shout out to Cheetah unnie love the colab
Dont care the rank, as long as She perform like her own Free concert and audience are enjoying her performance ,its not being competing anymore
Im really amaze BOM
=
THE 2NE1 SIGN IN THE END GOT ME OMG IM CRYING
=
This is the most confident I've seen Park Bom, I'm so happy she's getting her carisma back and self confidence! This has also been her best look since her comeback to the kpop industry! So happy and proud of Bommi ❤
=
That ending pose it’s what I didn’t know that I needed
=
jimin and soyeon’s reactions when cheetah came lmao i love them
=
QUEEN PARK BOM ❤️
She should have a concert in the Philippines!
=
4:11 aw she changed it to 2NE1 SIGN!
=
The song already gave me a little 2ne1 vibe, the fact she cover it's even awesome
=
I literally thought it's gonna be CL :(((( guess I expected too much. I miss them in one stage. All four of them.
=
the ending is adorable!
=
3 million!!!! Who’s doing it like her?? A single woman did that!!
=

=
This girl have amazing voice! Don’t give up girl!!! Keep go on,   Let it go what people said,  a lot fans still love you and want you come back stage!!! Please be strong, happiness!!!
=
3:12 the moment when hyojung  decided that bom has to be her wife
=

=
This is the bestt omg
=
That stage presence 
=
This version is suit for me, I love it ❤️
=
Pubilshed Sept. 12, but still watching again and again.
It really looks like it's her own song 
Dont forget to vote our Queen in MAMA2019, she deserve the Best in Vocal Performance Solo
=
ouh her voice make me goosebumps
=
2NE1 were REAL sisterhood. <3
=
ohhhhh yeahhhh, the best PARK BOM!
=
Don’t let a queen cover your song ! Its will become her own song
=
I loved this performance! Bom has great stage presence!!
Can we please get Bom x CL x Minzy x Dara collab plsssss. 
Missing my girls together 
=
THE 2NE1 HANDPOSE AT THE END GOT MY CRYING REAL HARD WTFFFFFFF WTF HAPPENED WITH ONE OF MY YG FAM AAAAAAAAAAAA I WANT TO GO BACK TO THOSE TIMES MY HEART I CANNOT
=
This sounds like her own song. That's how a great artist do it. Anything they touch is gold!
=
Let's go 10M views, BLACKJACKs!!! 
=
.super disappointed with the rankings bring back 2ne1 i swear they're always on top, kpop industry will be the biggest breakdown if 2ne1 reunited with blackjacks
=
I miss the whole gang
=
Her comeback must be like this,,,so upbeat
=
Omg Cheetah is Soyeon teacher when she was in PD101. And now she sang Soyeon's song. Wow Soyeon, you go girl...
=
I really love her!!!!!!
=
PARK BOM SINGS SO GOOD ❤️❤️
=
เรารู้สึกคนเดียวป่ะ ว่านางหน้าตึงไปด้วยโบทอกอ่ะเลยขยับปากไม่ค่อยได้และหน้านางก็บวมมากอ่ะ
=
I bet CL cried seeing this. She misses 2ne1 a lot too...
=
As expected, from my queen! 
=
We love queen bom❤️
=
Seunghee’s reaction to Bom is legit all of us 
=
I can't.. I reeeaaaaaally love Bom's version of this song. What can I do? I just love 2ne1's music   from the start. I get too slow when it comes to other group. But. I heard the original one. And.. Wow... Tq Bom.
=
My og queen on stage making my new queens (mamamoo) gawk does my heart good
=
As G-Dragon said, every song that Park Bom lays her voice on turns to gold whether it was originally good or not. I don't make the rules 
=
HER "2NE1" HAND SIGN AT THE END, OMG BOM I LOVE YOU
=
omfg this was fantastic
=
Dear mnet, I dare you to open international voting. There are so many fans around the world you know. That way, you can maximize queendom. Make it global with all fans of different country determine who deserve to the throne of the queendom.
=
This is just amazing. Couldn't expect any less from Bom #forever2ne1
=
Park Bom at all the haters and YG: I want you to be ruined :)
=
I watched the episode and Bom said she wanted to bring 2ne1 feels to this song, she practiced like she was a trainee again, recorded the song over 9 times, sent the song to the producer multiple times until the song was done correctly and Hann was the only song she listened to.(G) idle was hoping that she chose Hann , they said that she made the song her own , and her performance was reminiscent of when she performed with 2ne1.
=
WOAH that note I expect it to be that highe
=
HER STAGE PRESENCE OMGGGG 
=
Am i the only one watching this over and over again...
=
To be honest, I thought it was her own song. Go Park Bom 
=
That 2ne1 sign.. I'm tearing up.. and Bom's punch when she sings an upbeat song.
=
My queen
=
I soooo love Bom's version of this song :).. I never expect this to rank at  5th .. Haisst!!
=
She's back I am so happy!!!!! ☺️
=
Boom, I love you! It's good to see you back!
=
I have one word.

Legendary
=
My eyes saw them on the stage.  Someday 2NE1 will standing agian  by Parkbom and Sansara
=
Now i like Hann after BOM bring this song 
=
♡ Park Bom ♡♡  2ne1 ♡
=
U know, all though I really wanted to see 2ne1 reunion here, i am kinda glad that Bom is standing her own ground here. If any of the 2ne1 members were here, I know that the bitchy Korean Netizens are all gonna be like "she is only depending on 2ne1 to get votes"or "she cant make herself stand out on her own without 2ne1 at her side."
Whether Bom wins or not, to me, she is already Queen for standing tall and slaying her stages like true legend.
=
Proof that BOM is one of the Kpop Legend! Indeed queen 
=
Keep streaming
=
bom  your so good vocal is always amazing 
=
Its crazy to think this was a group song seeing how well bom did this as a solo. I like both but this cover gives me strong 2ne1 vibes and I'm obsessed with it. Imagine if all of 2ne1 couldve covered it together.
=
i thought its really her own song.. 
=
QUEENBOM!!!!!
=
is this a concert...wth.  I'm liking this ver better
=
She did a girl group song ALONE
She's really queen TT
=
When 2ne1 perform they own every song even it is a cover song.
=
Park Bom and Cheetah ❤️❤️
=
Bom just started singing and this was a whole song owned by her, her voice definitely is unique
=
Bom still stong and cute
=
My queen parkbom ❤❤
=
Queen ❤
=
Cant help but watching this over and over again.this song was so addicted bcz of park bom's voice!!
=
I’m a neverland but I really think Bom did quite a good job here. 5th was a bit.... exaggerated. I think she should have at least gotten 3rd or 4th
=
Jenny still got it!! Yaas Queen!
=
BOM's voice is another level  #forever2ne1 #foreverBlackJack
=
OMG she killed it !!! Omg that’s so awesome !!!! She’s awesome and still a Queen !!! Congrats !
=
queen park bom lengedary
=
2:31 giving me unpretty rapstar vibes....... jimin vs cheetah lol
=
a QUEEN INDEED
=
Soyeon reaction reminded me of pd101
=
4:11 
=
CL Dara Minzy are you guys watching this? Bom is here waiting for you. Blackjacks are all here waiting for our Queens!
=
You are amazing ❣️
=
YAS THE OLD PARK PARK BOM IS BACK!
her stage presence isn’t a joke
LIKE if you were reminded of ‘I am the Best’ when she did the punch
=
Bom babyyyyy <3 she killed this!!! so much respect
=
Hwasa 
=
I came back to her again because of that addictive vocals... 
=
park bom❤️❤️❤️
=
Kpop Community will be SHOOKT If Girl's Generation and 2NE1 will comeback
=
Wow.. It seems like she owns that song..   That's the True Queen.. 
=
to be honest I like this version!!!!!!veryyyyy muchhhhhhh
=
Park Bom is an authentic artist
=
It keeps me smiling 
=
Bom, I love you
=
I really like this stage. I think this was my fave bom stage on queendom.
=
Have y’all noticed the 2NE1 sign at her very last pose??? Hello!!!
=
Please vote for mama 2019
=
You did very well  ♠️
=
That hand sign~~~ OMG !!! I really miss 2ne1 
=
2ne1 ❤️
=
*LIKE BOM IS PROVING HERE 2NE1 IS THE QUEEN OF GIRL CRUSH! LIKE ROOKIES SEE THIS!!*
=
I love her really !
=
Is her performance for ENL,,Next week?
=
It's like it's her own song wow! That's a new level of GOLD! 
=
She owned the song :)
=
I love 2NE1 & Park Bom 
But I felt like she doesn't feel comfortable dancing as much or is a lil awkward so she didn't place well in Queendom 
=
Wawa preciosa  te amo
=
Queendom Mnet can YOU PLEASE OPEN THE VOTINGS FOR INTERNATIONAL FANS too?!?! So we can support our Queen Bom too. Let's be honest here. This million views isn't from knetizens only. Also you did it to MAMA 2015 CAN YOU reunite 2NE1 members THIS TIME TOO AGAIN?!? Jebal
=
This is was favorite performance of bom 
=
She can perform any song like its her own, yeorobun she is our PARK BOM!!
=
QUEENS CHEETAH AND BOM 
=
Her performance deserves to be in the first place, it was so freaking good !
=
One of my favourite performances on Queendom. Not surprised it’s almost at 10 million views!
=
This song was brought up from a six to a TEN !!!!!!!!!
=
Wow... 
=
2:34 jimin 
=
IMAGINE IF 2NE1 REUNION AS OT4 AGAIN FOR THE LAST TIME KPOP GIRL GROUPS CANT RELATE
EDIT: THANKS FOR THE LIKES #BLACKJACKFOREVER
=
Keep streaming
=
Why does she sound different? 
It sounds like she can't breathe
Not what I was expecting
=
Even if Bom doesn’t win the show, the show is really giving her great exposure and she’s getting back into being on TV. Since her comeback the media has given her lots of positive attention and she’s been really successful! Lots of people were waiting for her grand return. She’s really a superstar, Blackjack and Bomshell forever ❤️
=
Wuaahh just bom herself can make girlgroup's song just like her own n her vibe like... no offense i like this version tho wkwk
=
I’m not kidding for the first time I thought she’s performing her own song....!!! 
Edit: thanks for liking my comments ❤️
=
why not minzy to rap 
=
10M is close, let's support our queen bomshells/blackjackies
=
hands down to the effortless QUEEN she's just chillin but still kill it Her natural amazing unique voice tho SHE'S THE BADDEST
=
lol mamamoo's reactions are litEarAllY mEee
=
I still hate how YG ruined  2NE1 when its obvious they are the IT girls
=
Woaahhh she really brought the queen in queendom ♥️♥️♥️
=
PARK BOM REALLY GIVES OFF A UNIQUE VIBE THAT YOU CANT FIND ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
=
Her voice is the best.i love bom
=
cheetah was so amazing
=
I'm here. AGAIN. 
=
Hwasa was shooketh to the core
=
Soyeon's scream when she saw Cheetah She must be so proud. The song that she wrote was sung by a legend together with her previous mentor (If I'm not mistaken, Cheetah was her mentor during PD101 and she was entitled that time as Cheetah's daughter because of he rap) 
And damn, Bom is on fire! She literally changed the vibe of the song! That was great! As a NEVERLAND, I applaud her! The best!
=
Hwasa admires Park Bom!!! ❤️
=
There were a different story if all of 2ne1 member come out
=
bom
=
she did very well and amazing job
=
Pls bring back 2ne1!!! It’s like she’s doing this one alone vs an entire army!
=
Amazing as always bon
=
Bom se siente más segura de si misma
=
*me weeks later still shooketh that the guest wasn't CL*
=
I dunno but I really like her version 
=
Thats my bomieee
=
I didn't see any comment about it but at 4:10 she's making the 2NE1 hand gesture... my heart TT
=
i dont care about rankings and stuff. i just want to see my queen. thats all. coz no matter what they do, bom is bom. a legend. and no one can ever beat that. 
=
If one of the 2ne1 showed up here, i swear to god that she is going to be always first
=
just 1/4 of 2NE1, imagine the quartet performing
=
This song really suits with her, rock it park BOM❤️
=
Legend never die.....
=
one of the QUEENS.. 
=
ゲストすご笑笑
=
ALL OF THE GIRLS DID AMAZING FOR THEIR COVERS AND.I LOVE THEM ALL BUT LIKE SHIT YALL PARK BOM CAME THROUGH
=
hwasas reaction, she really idolises bom 
=
I need a studio version from this
=
You know a single woman owns the stage when she can pull out a group song by just herself. I love her so much.
=
The Queen. She is amazing!!
=
I’m screaming all the video I’m not kidding park bom is perfect I’m crying ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Yeah, my queen did that. 
=
All those people saying “she can’t dance” like gurl please.. following the choreography is not her thing cuz she PERFORMS! That’s the dancer jobs to dance while she sings and performs.
=
Cheeta
=
Keep streaming
=
What A powerful voice!! 
=
Whoa... She just turned another gg's song into a genre of her own...
=
Its feel like her own concert
=
What would have happened if she'd called CL.
=
Ok I love this remix but I do wish that in the beginning she sings a little more clearly but in the end it was still PERFECT
=
Not a huge park bom stan but I honestly respect her for going in with her solo career like ageism is a real thing in music industry especially for women so for her to keep doing what she loves HATS OFF REALLY
=
Omg she's make me cry
=
TRUE LEGEND MATERIAL YES PARK BOMMMM
=
OMG! 2NE1 sign in the end makes me cry. Missing them. 
=
Dont forget to vote for Park Bom at MAMA she's nominated at 3 categories.
=
I almost pass out thinking CL could be her guest. Damn. Guess I have dreamed too much
=
Park Bom, fighting!
=
Park BOM bring back 2ne1 vibe makes me cry
=
i love this so much
=
00:59 so true 
=
If 2NE1 made a comeback in this show,Im sorry but others group just done and whole Music Industry will shaking again
=
Beautiful inside out Park Bom!!! 
=
MNET is so lucky to have a 2NE1 member performing again in their channel. PARK BOM is a legend.
=
Did anyone else notice how she changed her peace sign at the end to a 2NE1 hand sign? Just me?
=
Yes, I see you. I know is you. I can do nothing. Just look and sigh. And go away again.
=
2:14 you do note di mo kami maloloko. 
=
i thought CL.. I want CLLLLLL
=
Park Bom served Visuals , high fashion ,talent and charisma.
=
Black jacks 
Bom will come back this Friday ( 25 October )

=
Park bom's best performance in quendom 
=
2ne1 fingers at the endddddde! Heart this for 2ne1
=
I love you bom , pls come back 2ne1
=
It's kinda sad how kids and new kpop fans
doesn't know who 2NE1, Girl's Generation, Kara, SHINee, Super Junior, TVXQ, CNBLUE, Tara, 4minute, After School, Psy, Rain, BoA, BIG BANG, MBLAQ, BEAST,  Wonder Girls, IU, Davichi, Fiestar, Sistar, Miss A, Secret etc. is
=
Goosebumps is everywhere !!!
=
She didn't arrange the song. She recreated it like a legend. She is one of the Queens of K-pop.
=
すげえ、
死ぬほど聴いた原曲忘れた。
懐かしい、めちゃくちゃに2ne1のスタイル。好き。
=
Lleguemos a los diez millones ❤️
=
Mucho, mucho, muchooooo apoyo  para Bom ❤️
=
gosh! An amazing performance by Park Bom and its only ranked 5th?! So unfair...Queendom's ranking is ridiculous.
=
Bom gives this song her 2ne1 vibe.  Im so proud of her. Also cheetah is one of a kind im so glad she helped our bom unnie. Im hoping a full 2ne1 members for the final stage.
=
Some talents are never forgotten ! 2NE1 is one of them !
=
I want cl for rap
=
Cheetah (Soyeons mentor in Unpretty rapstar season 3) doing Soyeons rap on a version by Bom in a show where Soyeon is in competition.......WOW
=
Much much better if it sang live...
Love you my Queen...
=
خوش تغني بس بلكوه تفتح حلكها  
=
She really nailed this version,  keep coming back to watch this!  Although disappointed with Mnet for not giving her a special award for being the only legendary soloist here, but like the saying goes, she who sings last, sings the longest and forever! Bom's here to stay!
=
*cheetah appears*
soyeon: IT‘S TRAINER CHEETAH!!!
”everyone is so excited by cheetah‘s appearance*
jimin: *lowkey triggered*
=
Cheetah doing her trainees rap
=
yes. she is solo. i think it was so goooood cause she is bringing the song alone by herself:( 
the result have to be better...
=
I shivered. When Cheetah appearance
=
Omg bom such a great voice but dat face looks much bloated,make up artist doesnt really do a good job here.
=
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
my gay heart :(((((((((
=
Lmao I was like she kinda looks like someone from 2ne1 but then I’m like WTH ITS BOM I MISS HER
=
The male fan at the beginning is literally me
=
STOP talking about 2NE1! This is about Park Bom and she has proven she can manage the STAGE! #BomSquad
=
Even in her 30s, she still is the Bom from when I’ve known. Strong and power. Ages or hiatus did no harm to her. God bless Bom!!!! Bomshell and Blackjack until forever!!!
=
Love it so muchhhhhhhhhhh 
=
So desperate to see 2ne1 is together on this stage. Bom’s voice is bringing back so much 2ne1 memories!
=
Bommie the Queen
=
2 million in just 20 hrs? now that's something. It also shows how much we miss Bom and 2ne1..
=
Still can't move on from this performance. It's obvious people loves her to sing and perform this kind of genre.
=
Park Bom voice is one of the most memorable in kpop, I won't lie I liked 2NE1 song just because of her unique voice
=
You guys keep on saying that it would be better if 2ne1 comes eventhough its a good thing but damn the competition will be over... Have mercy
=
Born to be shine
I think she's a little bit dissing Jennie. Look at her coreo and outfit.
(Black what? ) WHAT A QUEEN
=
I miss 2NE1 so much...!
=
your single performance =all others group performances
you just nailed it
=
She will be my queen forever
=
She is Queennnnnnnn!!!!
=
This is how you perform! She takes a risk and does her thing. She doesn't follow the CD to the T!! YES QUEEN!!! ❤❤❤
=
I don’t care if she win or be on first place all I care is that sees regaining her confidence and she’s back. She performs solo in a group competition in that case only her single presence can occupy 6-8 members of People in that reason alone she is a literary queen
=
her voice
=
Mnet.. Do you want high higher and higherrrrrrrrrr rating? Pls just need to bring 2NE1 on stage again.. everything let them cover 
=
Still in love with her voice and her. Can anyone tell me where I can watch the entire season?  I wanna see Bom again. 
=
CL can’t come cos Mnet and YG...
=
CHEETAH!!!
=
If 2NE1 comeback, they gonna end all the girl gps careers.
=
this not even half of 2ne1, what a queennnn❤
=
Please vote Park Bom for MAMA she nominated in 3 categories
=
What I like about her performances is the fact that you can tell they're completely live (Mamamoo's performances are live too). But in her case she's alone and she has to sing the entire song alone, so I respect that a lot.
=
Keep streaming
=
Keep streaming
=
I knoe cheetah will come and I'm still surprised
=
Keep streaming
=
I love this concept SO MUCH♥️
=
When see her I want cry...  fighting Park Bom ❤
=
Bom singing a fast tempo song
Cheetah gave me goosebumps 
Bom having choreography 
Bom doing 2NE1 sign at the end
BOM breathes fast at the end coz she’s been like “ why did i chose a fast song?” HAHAHAHAHA
=
AMAZING
=
Queen?
YES
=
Keep streaming
=
i dont get the part why this performance got 5th??? I mean seriously??????
=
Why do i feel like her voice suits on this song like she owns this song with a twist!  #blackjacksforever #bomshells
=
BOM is love... the Queen
=
Badass cheetah!!! ♥️♥️♥️
=
Love Park Bom 
=
0:15
=
I SERIOUSLY THINK THAT PARK BOM'S FINAL PERFORMANCE IN THIS SHOW WILL BE WITH HER 2NE1 CO-MEMBERS OR ONE/TWO OF THEM. I. CANNOT. WAIT. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE MNET.
=
The song that introduces many of us into queendom(sorry for mybad English )
=
The fact that this was the result of her reflections on why she got 5th on 1st round. Even claiming that the previous performance was a bit arrogant for just showing off vocals while the other teams aimed for a whole performance. Practiced like a trainee, and not being overly confident of her 10 year experience. I am proud of you Park Bom! I barely remembered Hann being G-iDLE's song (which by the way was a unique song that I couldnt imagine anyone who could give a cover that would do justice) while watching. 
Actually, you didn't do a cover. It was a revival. 
End point, I'm just so happy with her performance that I have to listen to this everyday. else my day wouldn't be complete 
=
Legend
=
Love park bom but she’s lip singing
=
Her attitude/emotions in front of the camera is very 2ne1.. No matter what song she covers the "badass/girl crush aura of 2ne1" is naturally showing. That's one thing you cannot just learn overnight or be covered by fancy dress or backup dancers. 
She is now showing off, The legend is now representing her team very well, that's the 2ne1 stage presence.. 
Goodluck to other teams. She is now conquering the stage to tell everybody 2ne1 is no joke. 
we are all proud of you. 
 Park Bom ,
=
she's  beautiful like before
=
I keep forgetting Bom is not with YG anymore. Glad to see Queen Bom
=
الملكه بارك بوم صوتها خيالي ومميز 
=
Eu vivi para ver minha baby cantando essa música... MINHA DEUSA 
=
2:16
=
So goood
=
Make it 9 million, Blackjacks and Bomshells!!!
=
You marry, your singing carre is finished. I'm sorry. My security guards will shaparon you.
=
where can i watch full episode?
=
Why (G)I-Dle choose Bom ? Simple because they know that bom will give Justice to their song.
=
Bommie we need this kind of comeback something dark and mysterious
=
better than Idle's performance
=
こんな難しい歌を1人で歌って踊れる彼女はやっぱり凄い❣️才能のある歌手がカムバしてくれて嬉しいな〜
=
Why soojin looks like she's possesed lol skkkkkkskkk cute
=
IMCRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
=
5th ? How the hell ?
=
She's so cool
=
Park Bom looks like one of those really expensive dalchi dolls you can get. (I call em dalchi dolls I don't know what their real names are but the channel I watch em on calls em dalchi.)
=
The real QUEEN IS BACK
=
2NE1 REUNION PLEASEEE
=
Woww iloveyoubom hihi
=
hwasa need work hard to beat this legend.. 1 person beat group.
=
La mejor sin duda alguna Park eres grandiosa te amooo
=
Win or lose, Bom proves that she is not just a queen but a Legend
=
I need to keep coming here....been crying a lot before
=
8,080,000M View!!!
Congratulations!!! Park Bom
=
Te amo, Bom
=
Her alone is VERY POWERFUL... But what if she invites all other 3 members of 2ne1. I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE, IT WOULD BE A TOTAL GRAND CONCERT.
=
Love my Bom
=
I wish she wore this clothing in finals.
=
This performance was fire. She deserved to be placed at 4 at least
=
Park Bom es sorprendente con esa voz inigualable que tiene
=
She's the oldest star in this show and girl showed them how a real show is done! Will always stan Park Bom and 2ne1
=
If 2ne1 performs the show will be over
=
Bom and AOA are the best of the this round
=
like i don't remember the original version anymore...
=
PARK BOM REALLY NAILED THIS PERFORMANCE AS OF THE SONG IS HER ❤❤❤ LOVE YOU PARK BOM  
=
Just...Bom is a queen.
=
SHE HAS DIFFERENT VIBES OF HANN.  YOU NEVER FAILED TO AMAZED US PARK BOM. CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK HERE IN PHILIPPINES!
=
Park Bom - Miyeon
Park Bom - Minnie
Park Bom - Soojin
Park Bom, Cheetah - Soyeon
Park Bom - Yuqi
Park Bom - Shuhua
=
I think this was her best performance from the show. I only watch these clips so I thought she would make at least 3rd place but 5th is ridiculous. I wish she wasn't discouraged but I think she was bc she seemed to lose confidence in subsequent performances  I hope people told her how good this was though, she made it her own song. And together with Cheetah, that was powerful. I felt like I was watching her in her 2ne1 days again, she's still got it.
=
who's that girl at 2:30 who slammed the table???? SHE'S SO CUTE HAHAHAHHAHA
=
Linda e puro talento
=
i wanted so bad to see cl coming out of nowhere for the rap part
=
2:17
=
Queen Bom
=
Let us stream tomorrow for Park Bom's music!!!!!at 12pm. Stay tune
=
Wow the song sounds just like its hers!
=
I hope on the finals, she will bring Minzy, dara and CL. Jebal!!!
=
Why she mumbling like that lol
=
2ne1 main vocalist doing the B-E-S-T in her every queendom performance! 2ne1 vibe! Adding cheetah in the performance is like adding spice and spunk to the song! Super proud of bommie its like she owned the song..
=
I guess Dara suggest cheetah to perform with her because cL can perform with her because she still inside the dungeon of YG . Dara and cheetah are friends for a very long time . Dara and cheetah have been in the same variety show . Maybe Dara suggested cheetah since cL can’t perform with her .
=
0:14 i almost get heart attack when i saw yuqi . she looks like sandara
=
No one is going to talk about Cheetah ? When she appeared I was so surprise and happy, she's so badass !
=
3:11
=
Park bom is the best 
=
Park bom is the best 
=
9M ! congratz PARK BOM :)
=
Queendom result is bull. Doesn't matter because she the queen.
=
1:48 who is she
=
これはなんの企画（番組）ですか？
=
ผอมลงแล้วนะแต่เสียงดีเหมือนเดิม
=
Beautiful girl
=
Bom would be good at singing joseon music
=
How is she losing weight so quickly! She looks sooooo good!
=
So Our Queen is backk!!
=
1:23
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
I like her make up 
=
Do you remember... you remember...remember 2NE1 ?



(Edit) Ty for like my comment
=
that ending pose im- 
*cries in a corner*
=
=
And suddenly I miss 2ne1
=
Park Bom's presentation is a big win for me.Bom's beauty is natural along with her voice and she dances simply and gracefully she deserves a higher rank in Queendom for that presentation
=
Kill them my Queen!!!
=
Who else thought Bom was going to bring one of her 2NE1 members?
=
2:26 :))))))
=
I honestly can't get enough of this song. Bom's voice on 'new' material, delivered with the 2NE1 attitude I've missed so much. Yes.
=
Love hwasa's face is like - I am making a mental note of this performance
=
2NE1 Suprise Union plz
We have long wait 
Plz let Blackjack happy
=
I like Bom's version a whole lot better
=
Go 15m perfomance fire (G)idle and 10m Park Bom , Blackland united
=
Cheetah wish it could be CL
Eunji wish it could be Minzy
=
That iconic Bom punch though, I remember I am the best....... 
Where's my Blackjack at?????
=
2:17
=
She and (G)idle no deserve this show, their another lv
=
The fact that this has 8 mil veiws just proves how iconic Park Bom is.
=
QUEEN BOM
=
that 2ne1 sign in the end❤
=
So I listened to the original (I love it btw!) and wow they really sound different! Bom really made this song hers.
=
Oh really? I just already know that this rank 5/6 . So disapointed ! Seem like PB make it be her own song !
=
1:19 thumbnail
Thank me later.
=
I know my idol 2ne1 proud of boom love you 2ne1 forever
=
Two queens on one stage
=
I'M REALLY GONNA SUE IF THIS SHOW ENDS WITHOUT A 2NE1 REUNION PERFORMANCE
=
almost 10M guys!!! =)
=
There is only 0.0000001% Dnation could read this, but please make Bom comeback with this kind of vibe and song!
=
Kesp treaming
=
I got goosebumps
=
<3
=
This is such a big deal to GIDLE,  a monster legend (Park Bom) covering their song plus Cheetah which was Soyeon’s trainor in P101. Wow, so proud 
=
Park Bom to taka Maryla Rodowicz Korei <3
=
Dance more my park boom
=
❤️
=
Agree this if the song very fit into Park Bom 
=
Only a member of 2NE1 can make other group's song their own. The arrangements is like 2NE1 style ❤
=
I wish they had a ComeBack for Real please please..
=
Park Bom 
=
Queen!!!
=
Whos name this girl???
=
Parkbomb 2ne1 = Rose' blackpink
Rose' blackpink = Parkbomb 2ne1
The best twin
=
✨
=
Uploaded 5 hrs ago and it already have 535K views . Legendary Queen indeed . Well I'm surprised but not quiet cause when I first saw G-IDLE I already felt the 2NE1 vibe In them that's why I know Park Bom Queen can slay this . Only a cover song buy felt like her own song . Please vote for her she deserves to be on top well actually she's already topping on real time melon charts
=
Park bom?
=
The studio version of bom's cover of hann will be released tom Sept 13 at 12NN!
=
3:08 was she singing here ? I'm confused
=
2:16
=
How can I vote? Hahahaha
=
she nailed it just by herself
=
I forgot original version
=
I can not remember ten thousand years ago like it was yesterday. Is like ten days ago and my short term memory is bad.
=
When she did that 2NE1's hand sign at the end...... TT
=
=
Ajajajajjaajjajajaja 2:29 the best part
=
I didnt expect that cheetah will be her special guest-
=
It sounds like it's her own song.
=
Wow.!! 
=
Queen Rapper CL is a little bit late here. It must have been her but her YG contract expires after Queendom T^T
=
QUEEN BOM
=
*this is currently viral in Korea. HER POWER*
=
Love you a lot Park Bom unnie  #2ne1
=
SLAY QUEEN BOM SLAY!!❤
=
We can’t be more proud of you  a living legend
=
ประสบการณ์ล้วนๆเลย เล่นกล้องเก่งจริงๆ ขยับตัวนิดเดียวแต่ดูยิ่งใหญ่ ชอบตอนเล่นกับกล้องมาก เสียดายแต่หน้าเนี่ยแหละ ทำซะหน้ายับเยินไปหมดทั้งหน้าเลย เห้อออ
=
Every time she does the 2NE1 hand signal I feel like it’s a sign to keep believing like they’ll be back
=
เพลงอะไรอะ what your music
=
หน้านางเริ่มมีอายุเเต่นางทำเต็มที่"
=
MNET love 2NE1 but Hate YG. 
Until now 2ne1 still holds the most win in MAMA by a FEMALE GROUP with 4 awards including 2 MAJOR awards (Best Female, Best Music Video, Album of the yr, Artist of the yr) plus Park bom 1(Best Digital Single)
A total of 5 awards all in One Night! True Queens!
=
Park Bom alone can outshine the others in group. She’s just wayyyyyyyyy tooo hot omgggg
=
she made this song her own... just as the queen she is.
=
She is so underrated in this show. The Legend deserves more 
=
Queen. She deserves all the Glory♥️
=
I don't care about the result !! 
I care about one of my idol im 2ne1 she really proved that she is a queen . . .  look and listen to her style . .   love you boom.. #2ne1
=
I cant wait to see 2NE1 perform in Queendom 
=
Park BOM   once a queen will always be a queen 
=
I mean, Bom doesnt need to work hard just to make this performance slay. Her voice itself, is SLAY
=
like how could this be at top 5?!?
=
As usual, when 2NE1 (or any one of them) performs, it will become a concert 
=
I LOVE YOU BOM!!!
=
Im only watching Bom❤❤❤
=
I think she was lipsyncing? Anyways, wonderful performance my girl
=
Back here again. She is really owning this song everyday, every play! 
=
Lmao I thought it was her song 
=
Gidle and Bom's performances ARE SO LIT NOT GONNA LIE their covers of Fire and Hann gave me goosebumps come on guys for the neverlands and blackjacks 
=
Bom doesn't need to prove herself no more by just watching this performance brings back the nostalgic old era of kpop Legends  ❤️
=
She kills it 
=
Wow i can't help watching again and again
=
I love Park bom ❤️
=
2NE1 LEGENDARY♥️
=
Omg Park Bom just did the 2NE1 sign
=
BRUH IM TREMBLING FROM ALL THE ENERGY
=
ยิ่งดูยิ่งคิดถึง2ne1 เชียร์แม่นะสู้ๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆ
=
still a queen
=
8 million :) bom fightinggg
=
park bom just turned this into a whole new song omg
=
Somehow, I find this "competition" unfair. Bom is a solo singer now. You want her to sing against groups of many girls. That just doesn't make sense. I don't get that.
=
I just dont get it when people expect her to show more? What else to show? She showed everything. She's a SOLO. You expect colors and harmonization? 
She's doing it alone, and im proud.
=
Let's not forget shes 35 and killing it!!! Kill it for us experiences girls!!
=
So far with DNation, Bom nvr had bad outfits or other things. they really took care of her. 
=
Oh my God,  my girl is dancing on stage, and her vocal tone, this song is trending no.1 now together with bom on melon
=
Who comes here again think that Bom won? 
She really made the song into hers. Like she owns the song while Gidle was great but the fire is still best on its original
=
It makes no sense to me why anyone would rank her below top 3 let alone top 2... it’s crazy to me that they chose such a biased audience, boms stage easily topped her 2nd and 1st tbh and yet they played her again and placed her 4th (or 3rd whoever said it) which makes absolutely no sense, I’m honestly just watching for her and that’s really it because clearly this show isn’t voting on who ACTUALLY DESERVES IT, they’re just voting for who they simply like or whoever they personally have a bias towards.
=
I'm still here after thousands replaysssss 
=
When she pronounced "Boo boo boo lonely life" correctly I was so satisfied  that part was amazing and even G(Idle) was shook
=
Well, that's our queen Park Bom..  No matter how many time you criticize her for her new appearance.. but her voice still remains the same..strong,  powerful with her own uniqueness.. I'm saying this because I want you guys to appreciate her talents without being judgemental.. whatever she did was her own decision.. and we are not in the place to judge her decision.. coz we're not perfect too..
=
3:26 oMG, THIS GIRL IN THE PUBLIC LOOKS JUST LIKE WEKI MEKI'S RINA
=
Well.... When I first time listen to this song, I thought that original is better than this one, but now... 
I love this one!!
=
Who can agree lion fits her if she sings that song
=
If she wins or loses, she shows that she can be not only a queen or a legend, but a goddess.
=
She can fill the stage only with her voice. I guess that she can do that even without a mic at ordinary-sized music halls as classical vocals do. 
High talent and a true artist that we can hardly ever see in the field of pop music.
=
Owning someone else's song is queen
=
I remembered Unpretty Rapstar when Cheetah came in because of Jimin 
=
Im back here because WTF??! SHE AT THE BOTTOM 2 WITH GIDLE??
lmao
=
2ne1's Park Bom 
=
 park bom ft CL ,, 
=
Love her ❤❤❤
=
Hope the rapper was CL! 
=
I literally got goosebumps within the first 5 seconds. That shows the power she holds.
=
The remix suits her well ..nice one park boom !
=
PARK BOM IS BACK EVERYONE
=
Bomie you nailed it. You look so gorgeous with your outfit. Beautiful Bom!!!
=
Jimin screaming when Cheetah came 
=
your unique, continuous special voice!!!!
=
wow, bom  IS SO GOOD IN THIS SONG
=
Park bom misses her members sameeeeee huhuhuhu i would really like to watch you again with youre members
=
The 2ne1 sign she threw at the end 
=
I love her voice ♥️. This song really suits her.
=
every time I see this video ... I feel like crying ... miss 2ne1 ... please join them again on one stage ...
=
Padahal d sini bom membawakan lagunya beda bgt, dan  bahkan lebih bagus  dr pd penyanyi aslinya . Kok ka dpt peringkat pertama 
=
Best Vocal Ever - Park Bom!!
=
I hope she brings 2NE1 for next stage 
=
she’s queen❤️❤️
=
Miyeon and Bom voice sound alike...
=
2:15
=
She should have a comeback like this. It suits her actually.
=
This is the real BoM... finally the queen is back.. she is good at ballad.. but darkness mysteriously red queen is so her
=
No doubt if 2ne1 made a comeback, the other girl group might take a break, because it's obviously the 2ne1 will shake the world.
=
She's the oldest and she's doing it solo guys. Its like an army vs 1. 
Good job Bom. This song became so powerful.
=
The fact that she’s doing it solo and the only SOLO artist against other five girl groups is truly power that only a queen can hold. She’s the main vocal to 2NE1 how much more if the three other queens will come out with her .
=
VOCALSSSSS!!!
=
2:26
=
Lion (G)idle
=
これボムちゃんなの？？完全に別人になっちゃった
=
You know what would be epic to have park bom to get 2NE1 back on that stage.. and then reunited. That would destroy all of the other girls groups. Just saying team 2NE1 forever
=
What if... She called CL and asked her to do the rap? Omg
=
2nd generation kpopper here 
I miss 2NE1 so much Bom's voice is so unique
=
She can totally do a comeback like this  this concept will suite Bom pretty well
=
♣️♦️♠️♥️
=
Some of yall wont understand that she is singing alone and she have to move her ass all by herself unlike other groups they can focus each member like Mamamoo each had a minute then rest.. this also goes to other group not hatin them or somethin... But respect the effort that Bom gives..
=
the fact that park bom makes this  show popular among non kpop fans. well, her power
=
Let her sing with her girls let's  see who will dominate queendom
=
You can tell how great of a performer she is. She is using everything she's got to rock that crowd.
=
I like this version better than the original. Love Cheetah & Park Bom!
=
Seriously bomie is just the soloist , isnt it  unfair ?
Correct me if im wrong tho...
=
just amazing. Park Bom you are a queen and this was epic!
=
Im really disappointed with the result.. it really.broke my heart thinking what.bom felt when he ranked 5th again.. it so.obvious.some people out there want.bom down.. even.g idle who performed 2ne1 fire got the last rank.. it so obvious that SOMEONE didnt like 2ne1, maybe that's the reason why park.bom always.placed 5th.. im so.mad.right.now..
QUEEN BOM IT'S OKAY.. PLEASENKEEP.FIGHTING.. DONT MIND THE.RESULT.. WE BLACKJACKS.AND.BOMSHELLS.ALWAYS.HERE TO.SUPPORT.YOU.. I LOVE.YOU...
=
I feel this version is better than the original version.
=
I cant wait for her comeback
=
Start today with HANN again :D LIke a sweet morning coffee ~
=
what a beautiful presentation
=
wow park bom really best performance,
=
- my Bommie so beautiful and song perfectttttt !!! 
=
she must collaboration with teddy(YG Composer)
=
her performance is amazing! Truly legend! She deserve higher ranking not only came with 5th.......
=
Best cover!
=
We love you bommie
=
This show let us see queen park bom..on how good singer /performer she is ,she is a legendour forever queen❤️
They wont make her win though..sad
=
Hann already was an excellent music, and Bom made it even better! I feel she is so faithful with the lyrics, making every expression deeper and dangerous. Park, I love you the best, your voice indeed have the power to make a regular song become a hit.
=
Keep streaming
=
Keep streaming
=
Love bom
Love dara
Love cl
Love minzy
Love 2ne1.
=
QUEEN  #PARKBOM ♥️
=
You should be number one or two or three
=
Ela tá dublando? :(
=
I love her voice and her style
=
Goosebumps 
=
I never really listened to 2ne1 but I feel like her voice sounds a bit shaky idk if that’s just me or her voice in general and pls don’t bash me about this
=
Yeaaaaaaaaaah
=
I think if its CL she could be the top..but no hate on cheetah she's best..
=
I like how it sounds like her own song and not G-idles if you get what I mean...
=
the fact that the competition is for Queendom and most 2ne1 fans wish 2ne1 will be completed someday but BOM is representing as solo artist now and she is really strong to compete to other girl group. Hope the 2ne1 fans back her up to stay in competition even if she doesn't win for the no. 1 spot, the exposure and being relevant of all time is what important and gain popularity as solo artist as BOM. Seeing her performance back on stage again proves that she still has it, her unique and powerful voice makes her different from other artist. Hope she will have this kind of genre upbeat pop music on her next song full album.
=
Who said she cant pull off even tho she's a solo artist bish she's a member of 2ne1 she can do it
=
Park bom get 5th place again with this performance
=
Is that 2NE1 sign at the end??? huaaaaaaaa... *calling all the blackjacks*
=
3:01, 3:47
=
=
0:35 those dancers holding the whole kpop industry on their lap.
=
Bom kuhhh...
=
A Bom me da arrepios!! Ela é tão talentosa!! Uma rainha!! Meu bebê!! Te amo Park Bom!!
=
Boomieee❤❤❤
=
Put it in 1.25 speed, thank me later.
=
(g)idle is so smart to let Park Bom cover their song. And now Hann covered by Park Bom ft Cheetah is on itunes top charts on different countries!!! 
=
5th rank?don't care
Legends?only
=
WOW BOM
=
Whhatt we reached 7.8 M viewss!!! Wow hahhaha
=
Where's ParkBom?? Wearing red dress is her?? I thought that was a Queen though. ♠♥♦♣
=
The song like her own, I love it!
=
My first thought seeing her perform was "Queen"
=
MARAVILHOSa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
She deserve first place
=
Cheetah＆Bom 
The costumes and makeup are wonderful and you may fall in love at first sight!!✨
=
I really loved this remix but I really didn't appreciate the g-idle's cover. I don't know if I'm alone
=
She is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING !!! PLEASE DONT LET HER ALONE !!!
=
Loved this performance so much! after AOA, this and OMG's performance were my second choice!
=
0:22 Soojin no move hahaha so Freezer girl i love it
=
I like Boms version better! More up my Alley!
=
perfeita demais :(
=
Omg! Favv Park bom❤️
=
Linda❤❤
=
I'M IN LOVE WITH CHEETAH I'M DONE
=
#LEGENDARYQUEENBom ♥️♦️♠️♣️
=
If allowed international voting I guess Bom is always 1st
=
Love park bom
=
Please put the Arabic translation❤️
I don't understand English or Korean but I use Google translator
=
LET'S GO FOR 8,000,000 VIEWS
=
that voice can make any song sound like her own original
=
Amazing
=
3:42
=
Wiped out!
=
And again Park Bom is 5th.. *THIS IS NOT FAIR*
=
Even lose or win, u are the queen !
=
Queen is back.. She did 2NE1 sign in the end 
=
Não consigo parar de assistir está apresentação da park bom.
=
IF MNET PLAYS BOM DIRTY IDK WITH THE WHOLE INDUSTRY ANYMORE
=
Is that jimin?
=
Getting cheetah to guest perform for your song is so OP like pulling out a super rare from a gacha game wtd
=
How to slay the stage!
Park bom: hold my corn.
=
Cheetah did great but imagine if that was CL. I would cry!!!
=
CAN SHE COME BACK WITH A BADASS SONG LIKE THIS? IT FITS HER SO MUCH SUCH A QUEEN
=
I'm getting goosebumps. It's like she runs the stage and it's a whole new song. Ain't complaining tho.
=
I love Bom and I love how she made it her own song but I lowkey wished it was CL preforming with her 
=
This is gotta be an unreleased 2ne1 park bom solo song
=
Let's talk about beauty and vocals, let's talk about Park Boom
=
She covering for 6 voice and u expect her to dance like other group? If park bom left the show i will stop watching..
=
They're  doing BOM dirty ; honestly she is doing it alone  and rocking the  stage but still placing low because the  audience is so biased toward their own groups  .... Iam salty as hell no denying it!!
=
We need 2ne1!!!!!!
=
Her voice is really cute !! #2ne1 #BlackJacksforever
=
I'm so tired of her getting low rank like wtf???
=
She deserves higher ranking— I hope this doesn’t discourage her or disappoint her in any way. I would like to believe she has a strong spirit to let some rankings get in her way
=
i can't wait to see her and Hyojung joining forces to sing a ballad on the next challenge
=
Park Bom doesn't need a contest or some sort of a competition to prove that she's a queen. A real queen would humbly bow down to give chance to the new generation of artists. Just saying.
=
Can't believe she's ranked 5th. With this showmanship plus the appearance of Cheetah. Grr
=
IM SO HAPPY BOM TEAMED UP WITH CHEETAH !
=
4:09 es tan tiernaaaa ❣
=
No me canso de verla :3
=
4:11 still 2ne1
=
That's the veteran we talking about ✋
=
I love her voice sooo much.
=
Yepp the baddest fighter in this show, this is what pp call Legendary
=
5th place? Again? YGGGGGGG 
i mean MNETTTTTTTTTTT
=
It is not a fair competition Bom ranked 5 again ? Duh
=
4:11 that hand sign represents 
=
2:15 you do note is da liar and ma peyk. Anyone from Philippines? 
=
love you so much Bom!!! <3
=
Keep streaming
=
Its really sad she's rank 5 again 
=
Is intern allow to vote ?
=
this versión of han is the best !!! Bom is the queen
=
If there was an international vote PARK BOM already won
=
Can't believe this is 5th. Smh.
=
AND KIDS, THIS IS HOW ITS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE
=
好可憐....
=
Park Bom deserves the world I love her
=
Omo 
=
2:12
=
Park Bom deserves to be no. 1 on this performances
=
those backup dancers need some work
=
2:56
3:01
3:48
=
Miyeon is so proud of her sunbaenim i can see , when she said she became a singer because of Park Bom 
=
This is park bom that i know, yg artist esp 2nei1 and Bigbang really an idol who made us enjoy what they perform and i mean we really enjoy the music not the visual not the dance not the clothes, Its just gave you an happiness feelling
=
*These Queendom performances are going to save kpop this year*
=
THE NUMBER OF TIMES I’VE WATCH THIS IS UNHEALTHY
=
I love Cheetah. She's fantastic. But can you imagine if she had brought CL or Minzy out to do the rap piece?
=
Bom to YG- *DO YOU REMEBER WHEN 2NE1 DISBANDED? DO U REMEMBER WHEN YOU LEFT ME HANGING*
=
The best
=
She did the 2ne1 pose at the eeeeend..  I'm crying. 
If I didn't know that G-idle is the original singers I would be mistaking this as her own song.
=
omg cheetah putting a verse into soyeon’s song after she mentored and rooted for her in pd101 when soyeon was just a trainee  i’m cry
=
2NE1 vibes.  She just made a comeback to the fierce and girl crush style.
=
Is she placed 5th again?? WHY? I DONT UNDERSTAND
=
The 2ne1 sign at the end is very important and Bommie seems to enjoy the stage and that too is important and I was scared for her when she signed up for Queendom but it seems that nothing can hold her back. I've seen so much improvement and it's the only 2nd ep and I love that she is trying to get back to where she used to be but I believe that she will soar higher and higher. 2ne1to infinity and beyond. Bommie you will always be our number 1.
=
BOM transformed this song to hers!! She deserves a bigger stage!!
=
I think this deserves to be on the Top 3 at least. I mean, this is a really great cover and that's what round 2 is all about right? She put her own flavor into Hann and it sounds amazing. Nevertheless, whatever their rank is, they're all great. And Park Bom? She doesn't need to prove anything. Being in this show is only a reaffirmation that she's a great performer and it's always great to see her do everything with passion.
=
The fact that this performance at the 5th place, just BIG F!!
RYFKM!?? I expect at least she got one higher rank, DANG MNET!
=
just look at soyeon being super happy bcoz her song is getting covered by a veteran park bomband trainer cheetah!! 
=
She always mentioned 2ne1  she even do the 2ne1 sign ag the end 
=
well, if boom left the show then i stop watching this
=
Park bom on fire
=
I'm from Thailand.
=
Love Park Bom and 2NE1 so munch❤️❤️
=
it's remind me of 2ne1 days .
=
I love this version more than original one but respect the one that original
=
This is Bom my queen  i miss her voice  one of the k artist who have unique voice
=
OMYGOODNESS!! This version is so *POWERFUL*  #Blackjacks #ParkBom #QueenBom
=
Thats only Park Bom performing. What if all of 2ne1 members performed on that stage? THAT WOULD BE VERY EPIC!!!!
=
I love her and I always support her from your fan Park Bom
=
Keep fighting unnie remember you're 2ne1 we blackjacks are still here to support y'all.
=
Keep streaming
=
i love this
=
Queendom? I only know QueenBom!
=
Amazing voice
=
她的臉一直讓人分心欸
是不是打太多有的沒的
整個人很不自然
=
just curious, who won this Queendom anyway ?
=
2:15
=
Cheetah got me shook
=
today, many seems to have forgotten about park bom, i really love her
one time she was very loved, the scandal ruined everything.
i hate yg entertainment, it's like they never cared about her.
her voice is so special, i'm now watching her on queendom, so sad that she's always ranking low, her you and i performance  was a rollercoster of emotions and memories and hann was lit , i really believed she was going to rank in the top 3 (and also, stop mnet making bom looks like she's bad).
she  seems different because of the plastic surgery but her personality, talent are the same.
stop sleeping on the main vocalist of 2ne1;
support her solo career, she really deserve recognition.
she still have that powerful aura around her, that charisma and magnificent stage presence
=
Andito na naman ako.. Hahaha LSS
=
3:11 “I forgot I was an idol for a second” hahahhahaha
=
Park Bom slays Singing the whole song alone is no joke while doing some choreo. Love you Bommie! The more I see you perform in Queendom the more I thirst for 2ne1 reunion! Please 
=
Im glad she sing using her own vocal range and didn't follow the original vocal blindly
=
Park Bom unnie if you can bring the rest of the kids with you, please perform CRUSH. If not, I'm okay with SHAMEFUL. 
=
Doing 2ne1 handsign after the performance means that BOM never forgets where she came from..
#FoureverQUEENS
=
You know that feeling where you wanted CL to be the rapper?
=
I think is really unfair that Bom have to perform alone while the other girls perform as a group
=
lol i still don't know how she end up ranking no.5, she definitely deserve more, like at least no.3
=
She is out of industry about 5 years, so many things was changed rapidly. She is brave enough to join in this type of competition which the competitors are representative GG of this era ( they're obviously talented, and good performer).  But park BOM has loyal fans that beside her during her proses to gain her another glory. TBH there's so many good performer in this show, but park BOM is special. They can't compete her in Bomshell hearts
=
Park Bom said she was embarrassed to be #5. Bom plz dont be ashamed us international fans love u #blackjack4life #bombshells :)
=
What show is this? I’m so behind in the kpop world lol
=
Bomshells can now vote Bom on Mnet website. The more social media accounts you have the more votes you can give to Bom ❤️ I set an alarm to vote Bom everyday it only take me less than 5 mins. Sincerely recommend all the blackjack to vote Bom together ❤️
=
Bom slayed it and can we also talk about cheetah? She slayed it too that rap part her gestures her rap and thayt eye that was so good eveb better than this pass mama performances
=
Why her rating is so low?  Come on her performance Is so amazing
=
Imagine how great YG would be if he let his artist be as free as this.. Dang! She just owned the song
=
She’s just singing, walking, not really dancing just having fun but damn she owned the stage! Her presence, her voice, how she interacted with the camera, the song arrangement. It’s enough to know that she’s on a whole another level!!
=
Girl! I thought this was your own original song that’s how good and natural it felt when you sang it! Such stage presence we missed you and 2ne1 but you’re giving us back a little part of what we lost when 2ne1 disbanded. Queen!
=
2:55 THAT SMILE!!! 
=
This deserves top3 honestly
=
Right now she’s spitting fire 
=
I love her so much!!!
=
I love this remix damn much
=
2:55 that smirk-
=
I watched this at work in the office, when no one was around, and i sobbed to myself  quietly as i thought -wow the legend lives onT_T I love BOM so much!!T_T
=
Watching queendom just for Bom
=
Can someone enlighten me why is dis in the 5th place
=
Style YG haha so cool hann
=
First Solar does Jimin's rap from Puss then Cheetah chimes in with Bom, Jimin must be having Unpretty Rapstar flashbacks
=
well what we expect she's queen
=
Suits her so well !!!!!
=
ICONIC!!!
=
Who is this girl at 2:29 SHES ADORABLE I LOVE ALL HER REACTIONS TO EVERYONE
=
How is this only 5th when this was first released I thought it would be in top 3
=
LIPSYNC 
=
Fue epico!
=
she deserve to be in 4th place rather than lovelyz. i mean based on the performance not personality,look. no offence for lovelyz's fan.
=
How does the voting work here in Queendom?
=
SHE MADE IT HER STYLE
=
Is she really singing?
=
3:41
=
2NE1 fingers! RAISE UP!!!
=
YG is SHAKING.
=
*5th place again? she didn't deserve that. she deserves 1st or 2nd. she owned this entire song.*
=
Stage presence off the charts here
=
Bom's voice has natural sound effects to it. It's so damn unique it's ridiculous
=
Wowwww
=
Amee!
=
Now where're the people who called her "ahjumma" in the first episode, huh? see this fire ♥
=
This is why she's the pioneer of girl crush concept people. #straightfire
=
Lady and gentlemen this 2ne1’s Main vocalist the most talented and Unique Singer ... M crying TT.TT she went through a really hard time ... now it’s time for her to shine again ... she deserves more and more
=
I  Really like parkbom version....can't stop playing!
=
HAPPY 1M MY QUEEN AND EVERYONE SUPPORTING BOM RIGHT NOW
=
I still can't get over to this performance of her. I watch it like a million times but bom still awe me. Please blackjack and bomshell, don't stop streaming.
=
Movie haha Party girl chimo chimo
=
Hey YG look ! What it is ? Yes, a proper Bom solo.
Oh and look at the comments ! Yes people outside Korea who doesn't give a s*** about her prescriptions meds from 10 years ago !
=
Ok but Can we talk about the background dancers for A minute
=
4.4 million views and still counting !! Now that's my queen !
=
Am I the only one crying because I miss 2NE1 so much? 
=
more viewssss rode to 9M
=
Can’t believe she only came 5th with this :(
=
This makes me mad. How come this performance rank 5th. Are you serious? This deserves #1. No wonder Korean tastes is so weird. Internationally it charted high and most of the views are coming from International fans. This is crazy. They should open international voting. Mnet sucks! Unsubscribe. This is cheap! Unfair! Unjust!
=
OMG.. I could just only cry when she did the finger-sign, 2ne1 sign. 
=
The moment she shouted "You!" lifted my soul up. Goosebumps!!!
=
3:11 that was so funny reaction
=
They all really surprise that the song fit her so well. Gurl that shouldnt be a question. BOM is one of the 4 MOTHERS OF GIRL CRUSH CONCEPT IN THIS INDUSTRY.
=
We all know Bommie’s gonna slay anyway. I’m just here for those honey legs. Like omygaaaad 
=
I just realized it's Jimin and Cheetah's first time on the same show since UPR :o
=
I love watching all of these and seeing how supportive everyone is of one another 
=
Putting her 5th? they really want to kill boms career .... I feel sad for her, now i get it why we should not put the whole 2NE1 group here...
=
Bommie 4ever - 2NE1 a legend
=
How I wish the special guest is CL
=
There's so much drastic physically changes on her, but not her quality as a singer #claps #love ❤
=
1:23 got me everytime... barely able to move her mouth to talk.
=
Forever Queen Bommie!
=
This performance should be top 3
=
how can this still place 5th? im so annoyed.
=
I wish performance' rapper is CL.
=
proud of you park bom.  solo vs. groups. i salute you 
=
She's a legend after all♥️♥️♥️
=
7.1 m 
=
this deserves top 3 wtf
=
This performance ranked 5th place? BS!
=
Love u bom!
=
I am fan of gidle but i got goose bumps she is truly a performer a talent i just love this
=
Just watching this show bcoz of her..
=
wow 7M!
=
2:17
=
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO SEE!
I will never get enough of Bom she a queen!
=
That's what you call autotune but w/o edit! Lol
=
Just look at Park Bom she is over 30 years old and look at her energy awesome
=
2:16
=
Bom you wanna win ? Do with cL
=
If I didn’t look at the title I would have thought it was Bom’s new comeback !
=
If Mnet just use Park Bom for ratings. I swear to let karma attack you.
=
Park Bom give justice to HANN thankiu Bommie... And this song n this type of music suits her... She nailed it... I really really does hope both Park Bom n Gidle will doing great on the song.... I need new fandom NavieJacks?
=
2ne1 sign at the end of the perform. MY BLACKJACK FELLING IS BACK
=
Not being fan based, but Park Bom’s performance was the best this round
=
Open international voting... she will definitely on top...
=
I feel like she really deserved better because she changed the sound of the song without changing its value. I really like her version of the song
=
The most amazing fact there is that shes competing alone while othera are in group. Boms voice are really good that when she cover other singer songs, it turn out good.
=
Please God. I want to see 2NE1 with  4 members again
=
I cant wait for the studio version to be release i want to buy it
=
im watching this in tears while holding a middle finger to YG
=
I hope in the next episode Mnet can reunite 2NE1 together... I miss them...their performance will be very amazing and superb..
=
I lowkey forgot for a moment who's the original singer of this song. And i thoughts its 2ne1's unreleased song or Park Bom's secret track.  she owned it.
=
HOW IS SHE PLACED FIFTH?! this performance is legendary, iconic and beautiful
=
I like this version so much better. The other one is too pop, hip hop and r&b makes it way more powerful 
=
i am not a blackjack. but seriously i am impressed by her cool performance. well said, a legend never die.
=
I cried when at the end she made 21's sign with her hand 
She is amazing. Qeeen 
=
i love her unique voice. with cheetah rap. oh my,love this  
=
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME LISTENING TO PARK BOM UNNIE SING AND IM HVVBDFBVDJF WHERE TF HAVE I BEEN
HER POWER AND STAGE PRESENCE IS JUST DAAAAMMMNNNN <3
=
MY QUEEN PERFECT❤
=
Park Bom is so pretty
=
i miss 2ne1
=
The voice is perfect 
=
Mexicooooo loves Bom! She killed the stage! I won't overcome this performance! Love you Bommie
=
I miss 2NE1 now.
=
5th place again...
:(
=
I could never get sick of Boms voice. <3
=
Where can I see this tv show? This is so amazing !. Omg I miss 2ne1.... and bom... her voice is so beautiful
=
Cheetah my Queennn 
=
Vamos boom❤️
=
(G)I-DLE , PARK BOM more better than LOVELYZ
=
Let's make it 10M views black jacks 
fighting
=
3:41 wooooooooaaaaaaaa. Scream!!!!
=
Her ranking must be higher than that group who did a cover of BEG Sixth Sense
=
She deserves to win.
=
7m? bom alone made this 7m i wonder if the other member perform as well, it will break the internet for a while.
=
Bom, thank you for sharing with us your talent!!! I’ll never get tired of watching & supporting you. Hwaiting, our queen!! You’re never alone❣️ I love you!
=
What if CL comes out?  AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
=
<3
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
3:11
=
No tea no shame ...but I still can’t believe this performance got N.5 ‍♀️ also (G)idel ? I thought Lovelyz the worst also Oh my girl !!! So unfair anyway Bom did her best and she work alone ♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
It's reminds us of 2ne1
=
Hayo keep streaming
=
Miss u !
=
Win or Lose she's already a Legend together with 2ne1 members.
She really did great here. I love it. Very stable.
=
My dream is that 2ne1 meets for Queendom
=
Guys pls support her .. She deserve it .. And one day 2NE1 will reunion , 
QUEENS will be back
=
Please release a studio version!!!!!!!
=
This is only 1/4 2NE1, im gonna die if whole 2NE1 members out *hittttt
=
No one talking about Cheetah's rapp. She slayssss
=
This cover dominates iTunes WORLDWIDE with 13 entries!!! I guess Blackjacks Worldwide are still awake and forever will stay with 2NE1!!!
=
she brought the soul of 2ne1 on the stage.
Here is the QUEEN~!!!!!
=
Imagine having this queen cover your song.... I would die right then and there
=
Global Blackjacks were like “English sub pls.” 
=
I wont stop wishing for 2ne1 reunion.. I know it'll happen soon!!!
=
This suits Park Bom because  HER and 2NE1 are the reason why gg like G-IDLE exists.
=
When your fav is singing the song you composed. Gosh, can't even imagine how Soyeon is feeling.
=
Really. Seriously. Who thinks it's a good idea to let Bom cover their own song. She owns the song  like champion. Now I already forgot the original song
=
I might've cried just a little
=
miss bom making hann trend #1 in melon!!
=
Im glad she sounded much much better than last week..
=
even tho she did not win, at least she's singing again and that's what we always wanted right blackjacks? to hear bommie sing again.
=
Queendom is the best thing that happened in this horrible year
=
She may have depression because every single week she always get the lowest grades.She thinks that she should get higher as she is a member of legendary group 2NE1.But Parkbom...You always try your best but they don't appreciate. But You always be a Queen forever
=
Like the girls say : she stands all by herself, just sitting and gives emotion to the public all alone, that's the power of one member from legendary group.
She doesn't need to appeal you with visual effects, she only needs her voice, that's all
=
Even if Bom doesn't win, I hope she knows that everyone can see how hard she's working and that this show is really boosting her popularity 
=
Am i the only one that loved the way the others has their jaw dropped while queen Bom performed?
=
who cares about the voting, like y’all know mnet is a snake. what we should be celebrating is how Park Bom has finally freed from those unnecessary hates all these years and now appeared on a variety show. a variety show that is for girlgroups but she appeared as a solo. she’s such a powerful and a brave woman. it takes a lot of courage for a person to make themselves brave to appear on public after being witch-hunted by these haters. Park Bom is an inspiration. She will rise once again!!! Blackjacks & BOMshells unite!!
=
That must be hard and hurt, when another grup have friend she just alone and miss his grup while show. And she fight too up the power of and prov the ppl that 2ne1 still live untill now
=
And she's the only contestant from the competition that can sing live without playbacks and backing vocals unlike others full of playback and lipsynch they just dance that's it. Because she came from 2ne1.
=
She doesn't need gorgeous stage effects, because she is real queen.
=
Everytime she perform, it always touches a soul.
=
She sang the song like she owns it.
=
Every performance of her makes me think that she is always calling the other 2ne1 members to comeback with her...
=
This is what a true, passionate singer sounds like, she is one of a kind, she is a rare breed, it is as if she makes time stop.
=
Even if she's been placing 5th the entire time, im still proud of her. Imagine competing with groups who's always in big production whenever they perfom with their dances and all, while Bom competes with her vocal alone, and still not placing last, it means she did great, imagine if she's brought her members, she's definitely gonna place muh higher or most likely 1st!
=
I love she always singing with her soul, the eyes contact in beginning is killing me
=
She puts story and emotion in all of her performances
=
her voice makes me so emotional makes me wanna cry i don't know why
=
She still uses her green mic. Even Dara, CL and Minzy whenever they're performing. They still use their colored mics.
=
*Imagine if the whole 2ne1 performs there, then they will always win the 1st place.*
=
behind the camera
that guy who dances.
almost burst into laughter at the end when she caressed bom's hair.? lol
=
When you finally heard Boom covered this after all this years. I remember when I read in twitter that she is preparing to release a cover. I was so excited but it was never released. I love all the YG artist version of this and I waited for Boom and finally I heard this on this stage. Something I have to thank Queendom
=
When she sings this song , so many memory came out ..... the old days 2 ne1 and big bang
=
She has the power making us focus solely and seriously on her vocal
=
Everyone's reactions seem so forced or fake lol.
=
There's only one thing that make me watch Queendom and it was bcs of Bommie
=
Why isn't Bommie winning :( They're cheating her :(
=
I can't read the title , 
When bom sing 'Mianhe mianhe hajima' 
Me : OMG THIS SONG. !!!
=
Just by her vocals and her stage presence, she wins everyone's heart. We love you Bommie unnie. Stay strong. We're still for you and 2ne1 
=
When you had only sat but everyone was damn affected af 
=
Her voice. Just, there's nothing better. 

Anyway the camera work is splendid.
=
Them : like OH MY GOD !!
BOM: seat back and relax  and watch and learn 
=
Just by hearing her voice we could feel her emotion and swept away by it. 
This is a legend singing,  give a big applause to her. 
=
When she sing whatever kind of song. She sound so uniqe and weird but in the good way. She make that song alive.
=
We can feel each and everyone of their influence just in Park bom
=
as i heard bom sing this song i got goosebumps! singing taeyang's song
=
Who love Park Bom voice???? 

=
Youngbae is proud of bom .. this is a homage to BB and 2ne1's closeness..
=
I'm glad I can hear Park Bom's great singing and it made me feel that she's actually singing her own song even though I regret how the voting turns out ....
=
song of the year 2019
=
Ay Bomie hermosa Siempre que la escucho me da tanto sentimiento
=
There is one fan from another group asked me to listen to her idol cover. She said that her idol did waaaaaaaaaaayyy better than bommie. I checked it out. Personally,Bommie sings it better and hit the notes right.
=
While their are younger generation, i will always love Park Bom. She needs more love than anyone. I always love her and her beautiful voice. Her voice makes me cry my eyes out.
=
Yoo I'm nearly this close to crying  sike this so touching i can't-
=
Green mic is back!For those who don't know, in 2NE1 Bom had the green mic, CL the golden mic, Dara the orange mic and Minzy the purple one!
=
she's just sitting while singing, a masterpiece herself
=
Jimin’s reaction in the beginning is killing me lol  same. kept watching this for Park Bom!!!!!
=
she doesn’t need a big performance like the the other groups that needs to sing and dance and act, park boms voice deserve to be listened in a performance like this: simple so everyone can focus on her. that’s a queen voice
=
this makes me cry cuz idk the 2 groups have been through alot and she still here fighting 
=
I cry every time watching this performance
It’s full of memories, sadness, and glory. Touches my heart so hard
=
She just filled the room with her voice
=
This is real talent, the gem that we can never lose, no one can beat this Queen
=
I feel her emotions here oh my god.. 
=
*VOTEN POR ♥️♣️PARKBOMEN LOS MAMA 2019*

Mira esa elegancia esa delicadeza omg park bom la amo con todo !! Siempre la mejor para mi estoy enamorada de ella ❤

=
I think Park Bom shouldnt be one of the contestants here. Her level is for mentor.  
=
I missed her so much! Growing up I always looked up to 2ne1 as my favorite kpop group. It's the group that introduced me to kpop. Their songs were revolutionary like fire and the solo Bommie did "you and I". You can do it bommie! Fighting!
=
i dont understand the song, but it made me cry.. i don't know why!? 
=
0:36 this reaction 
=
Aoa girl's reaction is my favorite cos that's the same thing I did
=
Why do I feel like crying

Yo!Youngbae!
I think someone stole your song...
=
Park bom made queendom as a platform to release her music material that was hid in YG dungeon..  first "scarecrow", the song is her supposed to be debut song as a solo artist , she already recorded it but she debuted as a member of 2NE1, then now , eyes nose lips, she was recording her cover of the song when the news of her scandal broke out..
THANK YOU BOMMIE, THANK YOU QUEENDOM , THANK YOU D NATION :)...
Edit: wow thank you for the likes..
=
BOMS my Queen

I have a feeling that all of Park Bom's Queendom performances will always be remembered and will be well known even more in the future. Even if she ended up not winning the show, she will continue to be a legend.

Bom's a legendary! Can't waste this real talent. Whenever she sings she always moves a single soul. I love you Queen B

Park Bom is a Queen who makes other songs of her own. She puts different flavor to the song.

=
She really deserve *BEST VOCAL PERFORMANCE SOLO* in MAMA 2019!!!!! This hard working Queen deserve that we need to vote for her so bad!
=
Hay quá chị ơi <3

=
Park Bom sweetie, you are that queen! 
=
I really hope park bom  perform on mama stage this year and brings back 2ne1 like CL did back in 2015❣️❤️
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
❤
=
I saw 2ne1 lightstick
=
Only YG artists can sing YG songs so well omg
=
Green mic 
=
Queen sing a song of the king 
=
QUEEM BOM IS HERE TO DOMINATE THE KINGDOM!!!!
=
At the beginning why does she use hard b's?
=
This song, it brings back a lot of feels. The song she supposed to release, we're finally able to hear it. I'm so emotional.
=
Very beautiful, Park Bom
=
LOVE 
=
Vote this queen as best vocal solo in MAMA❤
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
If anyone's curious about the dancer: his name is Ha Sunchun!
=
❤
=
I miss 2NE1 and BIGBANG more coz of this 
=
Queen 
=
Mybe I'm the only one that think the dancer look really handsome.. Park bom slay as usual...
=
GD FROM BIG BANG ONCE SAY THAT PARK BOM'S VOICE SUIT'S IN EVERY SONG...HOW RIGHT HE WAS SHE OWN THIS SONG ALREADY
=
There is a saying that: YG artist always produces a great cover for another YG artist.
=
Boom, been a fan since 2009 specially your roommate days with Lee dong wook .we all miss you.
=
Yall know... she was supposed to release a cover of Eyes, Nose, Lips along with the covers from Tablo, AKMU, and Lydia Paek back in 2014 but then things went downhill from then onwards so it remained unreleased.
=
OMG!! THIS IS SO TOUCHING!! PEOPLE SHOULD THINK BEFORE VOTE!!!
=
I love park bom. But i dont like this cover:(
=
สวยจังเลย ร้องเพลงเพราะมาก
=
1.1Million View!!!
=
=
I’m crying, I miss their good old era.
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
Yes, I can’t understand what is she singing but I’m crying... Even if she doesn’t win ,she always be my queen...
=
❤️
=
0:30
=
Watching this again, the good thing about park bom voice is she can own any song with it
=
VOTE FOR BOM ON MAMA 2019!
=
❤️❤️
=
she just showed that she can slay even tho she's just sitting, a queen indeed.
p.s. don't forget to vote bom!
=
PLEASE TELL ME SHE WON FIRST PLACE!!!! PLEASE!
=
I love park bom. I love you
=
You know what's disappointing? Before the unit round, Dara uploaded her dance session with Lia Kim so I thought Dara is the one who will proxy for Bom in the performance team. And then before the fandora stages, Dara uploaded her duet with Bom for Lonely, so I thought that that is what Bom will show for fandora. But all my hopes were crushed.
=
If you want to see her attend MAMA2019 please vote for her
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Dope bommieyah!!!!
=
This cover is breathtaking, congrats to Bom for being in the competition. She's held off elimination against full groups, she's a phenomenon and I hope she understands she how much international support she has.
I highly disprove of the rankings Park Bom has gotten on this show. She has been absolutely wonderful with performances. I'm biased, but if this is Queendom, not Princessdom, Bom should win automatically.
Also fuck anyone who says she can't control her face due to surgery, watch 1:18 to 1:21. She absolutely has control. I love that 2NE1 mic technique she displays there.
=
❤️❤️
=
=
She need to control her breathing lil bit
=
you never failed us bom
=
ฉัยรักคุณปาร์มบอม ฉันจะติดตามคุณเสมอ
=
OMG  I'M REALLY MISSING YGSTAN 
=
Park bom from 10 years imiss you
=
wooooow chills
=
YAAAASSS QUEEEEN!!!!!!!!!!!
=
AOA voted for Park Bom as the best stage this round lmao tastess
=
Suaranya kok agak berubah apa itu strategi atau apa tapi bom memang the best gw mash blackjacks
=
❤️
=
When the dancer came to Bom I am reminded of Taeyang and Bom’s duet several years ago.
=
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
=
Let's talk about the dancer too. His expression in the end told everything. The way the scenario is divided in two, the way it tells a story.
=
When I heard park bom sang taeyang's song. I realized how much I missed bigbang and 2ne1 perform together in the stage  I can't stop crying whenever I hear Park Bom singing.
=
Park bom I promise u I will always support u
=
Park bom fighting!! Bomshell and blackjacks always support you!!
=
有中文字翻譯嘛
=
Blackjack, comes here for you!!!
=
Crazy how knetz and new gen of fans dont appreciate real gem of talent. Right now kpop is all about looks/productions/concepts/and fandoms influenced
=
Amo su voz ♥ tan única.
=
i got goosebumps and not just bc im cold
=
THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER! like literally..


1)     
Park bom is nominated for 3 categories on MAMA
2019 which we have been waiting to witness since 2010!


2)     
Park bom singing Eyes, nose and lips which we
have waited long also since 2014


3)     
And Park bom releasing her comeback song tmrw


THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER!!!!!!
=
I am late yeah I know I am sorry for that but I love you Bom
=
Her Voice sounds a bit different than before ... but good Performance
=
Real legend
=
I cry i cry i cry ,good so much
=
IT'S SEONCHEON RIGHT FROM SOMEBODY?!!!
=
Pls vote park bom best vocal performance solo
=
=
I am so glad she performed this. This song holds a history.
=
VOTE FOR BOM AT MAMA2019
=
If only 2NE1 sings this together 
=
That green mic.
=
あかん（ ｉ _ ｉ ）
=
She sang sitting and still hitting those high notes perfectly. Ughhh #QueenIndeed #ParkBom
=
No one can bit her on stage she's real legend
=
Her vocal technique always gives me goosebumps. Like daaaamn.
=
Those throwback vids from her past mvs! 
=
You know Park Bom is the Queen when she makes singing a song like this look easy. Also props to the dancer.  love the emotion he displayed.
=
If Bom works on her technique for a stable voice and her breathing then she would be unstoppable
=
I think she showed the GP that she still has a killer unique voice through this show
=
No need sexy cloth and sexy dance 
Just sitting and singing can slay the stage Yes,that’s the real talent and the real goddess With her unique voice,she wins our(blackjacks) heart
Once a blackjack,always a blackjack
#Sorryformypoorenglish

Why does it sound like Dara recorded the falsetto backing vocals?

Why does the male dancer look oddly familiar?
=
She's voice I'm so like Park bom
=
WHO IS PARK BOM?

AND MOST IMPORTANT IS, SHE'S A QUEEN.  Win or lose still a queen. Period

=

=
1:10 is that lisa from blackpink?
=
She seriously sounds like she ate the auto tune machine HAHAH so freaking unreal. She’s an amazing vocalist 
=
=
Trong Queendom nhìn chị thật cô đơn. Cố lên chị 
=
bom is simply shining. when we think she has showed us everything she has to offer, she still manages to amaze us one more time! we love you park bom, you're doing amazing!
=
Did anyone notice the color of Park Bom's mic?
=
i luv her...
=
Queen
=
This song is already sad but her singing it makes it more sad for some reasonHer voice got that effect y'knowWe proud of you, Queen
=
 queen 
=
Bom's voice passes all the emotion
=
I love how non of the girls are talking because they’re all just so immersed in the performance
=
Bom really does have a unique singing  voice and skill 
=
Queen 
=
Beautifullllllll
=
Is it just me or does any of you hears Dara's voice in the backtrack
=
this got me emotional
=
Am I the only one who’s crying? :)))))))
=
OMG  ❤️
=
finally she is using her green mic, best time for using it. I know she used it in her previous queendom's live.
=
Anyone misses 2NE1? Cos I really do :'(
=
My quenn!!!I LOVE PARKBOM!!!
2en1 Like!!!
=
Park Bom is a hope for Korean as female empowerment. She’s been through a lot of tough time and yet she’s here giving you all she’s got without hesitation. This is what a real artist is. ❤️
=
=
Park Bom literally made other artists songs to be her own songs. She sang it with her sound. Now, that’s Park Bom. She doesn’t imitate the original singers, She performs it her own way!
=
=
=
she is a new female artist as a solo career, but has 10 years of experience from YG, is friend with BIGBANG’s members and so on. people may think once she left YG, she won’t have any relationship with other member but actually she does. 
hearing her singing eyes nose lips by her friend taeyang made me realize that, idk, maybe she is not as alone as she might thinks
=
She is really vocal queen..
=
We need big bang and 2ne1 back bcs kpop has boring now !!!!!!
=
Who thought that the guy was taeyang??
=
I miss kpop idol 2nd gen so muuchhhh
=
โคตร yg missing you
=
Siento que batalla un buen para cantar y respirar al mismo tiempo, me da ansías, sin embargo sigue siendo el mismo timbre de voz hermoso.
=
in her defence, i dont think any member of the five groups can do as well as her if they go solo. honestly Bom alone against the rest place her at a significant disadvantage, but the show did help her overall in gaining attention again after her long break. 
and we all know if the 4 members of 2NE1 gather together, no one can beat them. the only group of their equal is Soshi, the two eternal queens of kpop. there is no competition when either of the queen is present
=
=
Win Win Win 
=
I Love Park Bom ♡  ♡
=
Wow wow wow  I love u bom. From Philippines
=
The dancer looks like nam taehyun in winner era
=
First time i didn't use  skip 10s
=
I LOVE PARK BOM FOREVER!!!!!
=
The way she delivered this song totally told us an story. If you remember her "You and I" MV and connect that with this stage, you can understand that the memories (or the ghost) of her former boyfriend still hunts her. Like as "Hotel del Luna". 
=
she makes this song deeper and deeper
=
Omg this song bringing back so many memories
=
I HOPE BOM WILL PERFORM AT MAMA AND BRING 2NE1 JUST LIKE CL DID HAHAHAHA
=
Now that Bigbang members are getting discharged from the military I wish there will be new collaborations 
=
Loveit
=
Actually if you look at the vote details Bom got more than 6000 points from live public voting out of 7000. She placed low because they also counted the other rounds.
=
4.01 
=
YG Familyyyy
=
PARK BOM DUET WITH HWASA. WHO'S AGREE?
=
=
park boom win my heart
=
She didn’t deserve 5th place again :(
=
queen will forever slay istg
=
just smoke voice
=
The You & I scenes in the beginning, the song that she was supposed to release, her voice, the mic she used in 2ne1 days... I'm weak, guys T.T
=
Whatever Bom got place is..plsssss dont drag down the other groups,,it makes the fandom bad...they ALL work hard for it to be the winner...
VOTE PARK BOM IN MAMA2019
=
听得依然地陶醉
=
PARK BOM SINGING EYES, NOSE & LIPS IS THE BEST THING THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN TO KPOP. LEGENDARY QUEEN. 
=
Park Bom tem uma das vozes mais únicas e preciosas que eu já vi
=

=
YG biggest lost .....

=
Chemopirimbaaaaaaaa
=
I LOVE U PARK BOOOOOM
=
=
Done voting world wide choice my boomy
=
The irony that they make her sing a song from the same company that ended her contract
=
The dancer is Han Sunchun from Somebody S1 right?
=
Can I give he's 1milion likes ? 
=
I missed bigbang and my girls 2NE1 
=
she sang it with so much emotions i am speechless, it hurts 
=
Absolutely amazing! I always get a goosebumps whenever she sings.
=
Our girl making everyone speechless first in our hearts~ 
Ive realised only bom can make all the groups speechless like they dnt comment they just sit in aww while for other groups its like 'yas girl'
=
I feel you boomie 
=
4:00 me watching bom
=
Park Bom singing ENL while sitting, a queen. ♥️
=

=

=
Now i wish bom will sing this with taeyang in the future. What a queen!! Im tearing up 
=
Slay it QUEEN 
=
I LOVE YOU BOMBOM ✨
=
I'm not a expert singer but I think bommie did well but she needs to adjust her voice by whispering the words in a calm voice and later on the power of the voice will reveal at the end.
=
聽完覺得好憋
接不到氣的感覺
=
Guys vote for park bom on Mama!!!
=
#legend #queen 
=
I love you park bom❤
=

=
No one can beat this woman. She's a legend indeed. We love you, Bommie Unnie!! ❤️❤️❤️
=
Now this crushes my bigbang 2ne1 heart
=
Oh that  guy is from a Dance show named Someday!
Bom really sings the song full of emotions.
=
I just wanna cry....
=
=
I really don't like deserve 5th place cuz she sang with so much emotion and I don't think that YG really allow her to show what her vocal can really do
=
Park bom...i love u...from the first time i saw u.i really like ur voice.but,i worry abt u.the way u sing now its like u hv breathing problem nd u sound so screeching to my ears..but dont gt me wrong..i still love u..maybe u cn work on that bom..i really wish u  success in everytg u do.
=
BLACKJACK 4 LIFE 
=
There are so much emotion in Bom's voice. Bom proved that she's extra ordinary. She nailed it. Everytime I heard her singing , I miss 2ne1 so much.
=
=
Let's appreciate the emotions given by the dancer. He's too powerful
=
I thought its her song.. I tried to figure out whose song this was. But then I remembered its taeyangs... Actually it sounds great wd her vocals. No drama... Its amazing. I want it on spotify
=
I really hate their overreaction like I know ur shook but act normal it's so cringy anyway bom queen
=
All watching: is in SILENCE✨
=
How did she sang something heavily emotional in such effortless way as if she's just about to order her lunch in a small cafe.
=
Park Bom single handily increasing the stock prices of YGE. Damn she’s a legend
=
HER MIC AAAAAAAA
=
Mark my words. This will be trending everywhere
=
Im crying
=
Those people who click dislike was those people who draged her down before, and now bom is doing great they are not happy even how great the performance is 
=
Everybody was just staring at bommie  like a queen. . .
=
Only YG artist can perform YG’s songs
=
Why I'm addicted to this cover . I can't help myself to stop listen it
=
one of the best
=
QUEEN
=
I keep hoping at least one 2NE1 member would appear on her last stage in Queendom
=
I had goosebumps when she started singing. After a while, can't keep my tears from falling.  Park Bom is 
=
Her unique style of singing is so adorable <3 I want her to sing reggae <3
=
I love her so damn much! 
=
The best, a real queen❤❤
=
Can you please give english subtitles on what her singing only the reactions have the subtitles gosh I don't need that!!
=
So beautiful, my Queen. You own me.

=
HAYSTTT. I LOVE QUEEN. 
QUEEN;PARK BOM
=
OMYGOSH!!!  THIS IS SO GOOD BOM U THE BEST ❤❤❤❤
=
, and i'm crying
=
Soochun
=
I think in the future they need to revised the system. It's so unfair for solo singer like Park Bom compete with so many groups.
I think Queendom need to make  group and solo version competition in different season.
I mean, they make similar challenge like Produce but they include solo artist. How unfair it is. Eventhough Bom give many chance card, it's still unfair. Group power with solo power different. Even if she give her best performance, if the audience looking for massive impact performance with act, it's hard for Bom.
It's not like I hate Bom or the groups or the programs. But I think the competition format need to be change.
Edit : But I do thank Mnet for invite Bom to join Queendom :' At least Mnet give Bom more screentime than YG
=
Why i'm crying TT
=
Aku terkejut dan menangis 
=
I have been waiting for Bom to comeback and sing again. Yeah, and here she is, singing for those who believed in her. Everything is paid off. Go my queen
=
Her voice is so grating to my ears ugh
=
Her voice is amazing.
What is this song?
=
Every time she is sing am cry and i dont know why
=
QUEEN BOM NEVER LET ME DOWN WITH HER UNIQUE VOICE.. IT ALWAYS GETS ME GOOSEBUMPS.. 
BOW DOWN TO QUEEN LEGEND 
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️ bommie
=
2nebang forever!  2nebang is definition of YGfamily
=

=
Love my Queen Park Bom. Forever Blackjacks. Forever 2NE1!
=
♠️♦️♣️♥️
=
Not getting enough views. I miss 2ne1 and Big Bang. I wish there is a way we can get them all back.
=
My queen 
=
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
Omooo .. can't say nothing but PERFECT .. She sang this song with her own style :")
=
❤⭐
=
Why im crying?????
=
Park Bom...omg...good good good
=
She is the QUEEN   
=
2NE1.BIGBANG.Miss:(((
=
A Queen singing A King song omg
=
Results are just for the show anyways. Still u know who Park Bom is. She redeemed herself and shows how talented and legendary she is. Lovyou bommie.
=
Who's singing with matching teary eyed
=
Park Bom is a great example of a strong wonderfully made woman. After everything she has gone through at the end of the day all she wanted to do is sing her heart out. It's an everyday battle but we can all see how she slayed her demons and continually winning.
=
I've always wanted to hear her covering ENL since she said that she was planning to do it but THAT happened 
I am proud of her!!!!!!!
=
This is the first performance who has no interruption like a shout gasp or what they are just keep listening hahahaha 
=
Omg I though Queendom was Park Bom fandom's name  
I love her voice!!
=
=
all of her performances on this show deserve to be on spotify
=
I'm rooting for Bom and AOA in this show hope she can rise up this round!
=
=
Unpopular Idea: Bom’s voice hasn’t been damaged over the years... Yes she sounds different than audition- but ALL voices mature with age. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with YG making her sing in her higher register during 2ne1, but she isn’t using her higher register as much in 2019. So OF COURSE she is sounding different from a)signing lower and b)having her voice naturally mature since 2008. 
This is why I hate reading comments saying how her voice was damaged! No her technique may not have been the best. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it damaged her voice... again, unpopular opinion
=
Yess Bom!!! Shine Queen 
You deserve the best!!♠
=
Singing a pretty high notes song in SITTING POSITION is not that easy
=
3:49 feels like when you're entering heaven.
=
Maybe that Bom's voices have only one in this world She's the true queen of UNIQUE voice ♥️
=
It's okay if you didn't win this round. You're the queens' Queen.
=
I just love how eyes, nose, lips can perform without anything going crazy in the background. Just the singer, a mic and his/her voice. 
=
Why am I crying without noticing♥️♥️
=
I loved Jimin's reaction, I just wanna know what was going troguh her head, she looked really touched
=
I dont know why, but everytime i watch this performance, i always crying 
=
You make me love with you all the time When you singing bom.i love u  bom 
you make me forget Who is original singing 
=
Holy shiiit! I suddenly had this song in my mind all day and when I came to watch Bom's cut on Queendom, she started singing and I cry.
=
I'll just wait YouTube to publish Park Bom's performance at MAMA 2019  :)
=
I cried harder in this performance than Scarecrow idk whhy huhu
=
Her voice gives me shivers  I know there will be some who will say her vocals is damaged but no it’s not, that’s her technique. You can always feel the emotion she wants to give us, piercing to the heart  listening to her new single made me so sad  as if she is singing to the other girls(dara,cl,minzy) 
=
No matter about the result, bom always give something worth for us. She win our heart.! 
=
Her voice is totally "flawsome" (means flawless and awesome ) been a blackjack here since day one. I really miss the time that she's performing with her members and some collab with other groups.
=
THE LEGENDARY GREEN MIC 
Omg! ❤❤❤
=
Her emotional performance on this song makes me cry it’s so beautiful can’t stop hitting replay 
=
Seriously, you can't help but to have goosebumps everytime bom sings.
=
PLS VOTE PARK BOM ON MNET MAMA AWARD SONG OF THE YEAR AND SOLO PERFORMING ARTIST
=

=
Park Bom is art ❤️
=

=
I’m actually crying, I can’t stop thinking about 2ne1 and Big Bang, together as a part of a family. I know that now the things are different but I always gonna love them with my entire heart just I did till The begin...
=
❤❤❤
=
Those days when YG Family is the best.

Goosebumps. The song really becomes different when she sings it

=
The most unique vocal BUT so satisfying to listen.
Lots of love to PARK BOM
=
Bomshells please let us help Bom win this year's MAMA 
=
Omgee i miss the old timeees big bang, 2ne1.
=
She looks and sounds so nervous
This song sang by her makes me cry so much
=
The way her low vocals sound here is simply unbelievable! This is the first time I hear her singing like that. The moment in 49-51 seconds of the video just drove me crazy  what was that?!
=
i can't believe shes rank 5 again.. oh no.. look at this emotional cover 
=
I cry my Beautiful BOM Queen!♥️
=
Bom has this incredible thing  where when I hear her cover the song, I forget what the original sounds like. It's either my own bias toward her (lol) or the fact that her voice is so unique and captivating. It happened with HANN where I only listen to her version now and now with EYES, NOSE, LIPS. 

Please stream her new song Wanna Go Back!
=
Her voice is so amazing..it fits the song so well....I miss 2ne1
=
This song is one of my favourites and she nailed it... The vibes... Thank you Park Bom!!
=
So emotional..
=
this is literally my first time hearing the song never sure why I didn’t hear the original or the other covers I’m fine with just bommies tho so I’m good lol keep going bom!
=
I remember this song...I've heard it before.
=
The green mic oh my gosh can wait to see you comeback 2ne1. .
=
The dancer was one of somebody s1 cast...he's one of the most great dancer on the show.
=
 bommie . I'm crying.
=
Did anyone else notice Bom's green Mic? Her 2ne1 color of Mic... I'm not crying...ok fine I am
=
The dancer is Han Sunchun from Somebody right? I knew I've seen him from somewhere.
=
miss big bang and 2ne1 when they were at YG ☹
=
OMG!! The dancer is the brother of my Kpop dance teacher!!
=
This song is a masterpiece. One of the best written songs of this decade. Along with IU's Through the Night.
=
All I got was goosebumps because of her amazing voice. And take note, Eyes, Nose, Lips were and will always be one of my favorite songs! 
I love it!! ❤️❤️❤️
=
My baby girl! She sang it so well 
=
I love u ❤️

Why do I feel the need to cry everytime Bom starts singing...
=
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
When she start singing, i legit thought this is a 2ne1 song at first lol
=

=
I can see the audience were crying  same feels  I miss the old times 
=
Suddenly, speaking is unlearned.. when you sing my Queen 
=
Give the person who designed the stage a raise.
=
I miss 2ne1 and bigbang in one stage performing together....still hoping these two big time group will comeback again....
=
It sending me CHILLSS ✨
=
Yes yes omg ❤️
=
Oh this dancer from somebody season one he is a great dancer
=
I could feel the pain she delivered through  this  song. I cried till the end . Such  a queen ❤
=
Bom hitting those notes felt like
flash strike of lighting within your soul ♥️ #2ne1forever
=
Leave it to Park Bom to take ANY song and make it hers and SLAY!
=
I didn't realize that my mouth was open the whole time as i watch this! (Lucky me im alone lol!) 
P. S 
Didnt regret at all! Hahaha i mean she's freaking amazing!!!
=
Why am I crying? 
=
QUEEN 
=
MY QUEEN 
=
This is mind-blowing
=
OH MY GODDDD
=
The Green Mic
=
Thank you for the upvote AOA, Bommie really deserves that 
=
That moment when you were so focused and in awe of her amazing performance, but then at the end you see the dancer's full face and realize you've seen him on a few dance shows before LOL threw me off so much. Anyway, nobody can cover this song better, this was so good I can't even... One of my favorite songs being covered by one of my favorite artists.
=
I think YG is kind to Bom.e.g  let her sings YG/2ne1 songs on TV shows, let her to sing with Dara at YG building....
=
Park bom amazing 
=
Queen ❤️❤️❤️
=
I miss the happy YG days

=
Smiling while singing all throughout her performance didn't notice my tears are falling
=
WHY!?!?! THIS IS MAGICAL!! 


VOTE FOR BOM!!
=
Queendom is super hard to watch when we all notice that Bom is continously giving us the best performances but she still can't get a higher rank. Time flies. Feeling old to have to admit that the golden time for 2nd gen has passed.
=
The dancer is it Han Suchun from Somebody? He danced to my Queen
=
Bom is just that legend. I’m covered in full body goosebumps. I’m actually shivering. Wow.
=
Ah this made me emotional  
=
When the Queen sang the King's song  2neBang

=
Awww our bomie, we love you so much queen❤

=
Wow amazing Park Bom really is the best. And the dancer I know him he was in a dating reality show and was chosen by the girl who is was one of the contestant if Ms Korea too. I forgot that show and I forgot his name.
=
She really sounds like T-pain 
=
It gives me so much chills ..her voice is so beautiful that can touch your heart 
=
Her green mic  the mic she use during her YG days
=
wow, I got goosebumps again BOM your the best ever
=
Legends never die. ♥️

Fighting bom!!
=
Park bom you never disappointed blackjack
=
Omg :*
=
I miss the 2ne1 ang bigbang tv 
=
This is alarming, she sounds like she has a hard time.
she already has issues with enunciation and breathing even then while dancing and even when sitting down..,
Bom is struggling in this performance and any other performance but she seems determined to keep on singing..,adapting a healthy technique would do wonders specially in the longevity of her career
Even her falsettos are pure air and forced..,tbh she sounds like there is little room in her mouth to breathe let alone sing in this performance..,and that is a pity as she is very determined to perform..,
=
I love you more park bom. This song is beautiful and it is more beautiful because you sang it. Thank you..
=
Sensacional...Rainha cantando o rei Taeyang....Maravilhosa!!
=
=
can someone explain why did they react like that when bom started singing? please? i dont understand.
=
i love you bom 
=
QUEEN!!

Park Bom
=
Casually sitting there, slaying the song and audience are stunned with open mouth! And as time goes by, Bom is growing on me more. I hope and pray she soar higher as she deserve!  WE LOVE YOU QUEEN BOMMIE
=
I feel like this was the cover she was supposed to release years ago, she was pulled out because of the scandal
=
Su voz transmite tanto... Bom ha hecho un asombroso trabajo 
=
If only CL could see my side of things, she would agree.
=
Tbh when they released the ranking,I felt kinda bad for her. She don't deserve what her ranking is now. She deserve better
=
This is what makes 2ne1 special and no others can replace them.. Each of them got that talent very unique and rare.. I miss them
=
Legend will always be a legend #QUEEN #2NE1FOUREVER
=
Taeyang must be very proud of her!
=
Her voice is so unique, powerful, and soulful. I feel like crying while watching this video. I'm so proud of her. And I am proud to be blackjack forever!  win or lose, you will always be the queen in our hearts.
=
Park Bom really gave us the nostalgia when YG was still a family. The golden era of YG FAM.
=
She's A Legend Her Performances made me cry with different emotions
=
lots of love unnie hwaiting. please vote park bom on MAMA 2019
=
There must be something about being a YG artist. They are the only ones who can give justice to their labelmates songs.
=
OMG i remember when yg idols started to cover this song and I I really wished for bom to cover it and now my dream came true 
=
All those years of waiting for a Park Bom cover of Eyes, Nose, Lips. Worth it 
=
3:55 the background voice sounds like dara
=
My goodness! I was so engaged that I did not realize my jaw was dropped the entire time. I was not expecting this!
=
Angel's voice, hope bom will nominated in MAMA 2019
=
Stream her new song! It’s so good!
=
Beshi inupuan lang tayo ni Park Bom. ❤️

Nostalgic eyes nose lips. Bommie is a Queen indeed

when you can command a stage with just your voice mostly dominated by huge productions and all...Queen Bom
=
I just hope Bom gain her confidence back because she is one of a kind.  Be strong Bom! We are here for you no matter what. - From a Sone.
=
Queen
=
I heared daras voice
=
I'm so happy to hear her .Even if she doesn't win the competition, i'm sure she will win a lot of new fan with her talent 
Sorry English is not my first language
=
Taeyang performed You and I with Bom and now Bom performed Eyes, Nose, Lips. The feels the <3
=
The first round, she took me to church. The second round put my heart through the fire. Now this round have me in the corner crying while my heart is being purified by her voice.
=
Все в шоке от того, что она пытается микрофон съесть Ладно, шучу, милый пухляш уже не тот конечно
=
Yang kunanti nantiii
=
She’s always in my heart ❤️
=
I love how most of the girls look so invested in the performance and maybe about to cry, this song still has that impact years after it was released and bom definitely did it justice ❤❤❤
=
20 seconds in and my eyes were already watering
=
Missing YG fam ❤️
=
Missing YG fam ❤️

=
She's absolutely gorgeous ❤️
=
I've always wanted to sing like park bom ended up sound like a whale
=
Im just watching queendom because of bom
A true queen❤ blackjacks forever
=

=
0:36 jimin and solar is me 
=
Such a powerful performance <3
=
I love this confident looking bom!
=
English sub is totally useless for this Bom's performance. Speechless!
=
Im glad she chose to focus on vocals and work with her strength!! Just a few seconds in and Im holding back tears.
=
That green mic tho :<
=
Since only korean kan stream her new comeback, I will stream this performance instead 
=
OMG my fav song, thank you Park Bom for chosing this song

Eyes nose and lips is everything!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
=
So amazing !!!!!
=
omg what a serve i wasn't ready. i hope she win the show and that's on that at least park bom is mythological singer
=
The choreographer just looks like the male lead in Bom's You and I MV. Is it me?
=
Bom might not be in yg anymore but she will always be part of yg family 
=
Park Bom one of the Queens of Kpop
=
i love this song and love bom ^^ 2 love
=
We love you park bom and i’m support of you i’m the number one fun of you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
No matter what happened, and what happens, Park Bom shines wherever and whenever because that’s just who she is; I feel like she’s born a star, with this talent for music that no one can take away from her no matter what. They all had that reacion not because she’s a senior singer but because her performance demands it. Knetz can stay pressed all they want but it is undeniable that Park Bom truly is gifted. 
Mayhaps I cried writing this bc I miss 2ne1 so much
=
My queen *bows* reign on.
=
I LOVE U SO MUCH BOM❤️
=
Played on 0.75x speed and its so niceeeeeeeee try it guysssssss
=
Vote PARK BOM for Best Vocal at MAMA2019.. support her blackjacks and bomshells

=
#PARKBOM #2NE1 #YGSTAN #BIGBANG 
=
Ella lo hizo bien :') ❤️
=
If Park bom & rose from blackpink decided to do a collaboration, it would be the end for us i swear
=
Don't forget to Vote for Park bom for best vocal soloist on Mama19.
=
If she is not #1 this time I don't get why !
=
Man I can't hold my tears while watching this
=
i feel sad her rankings haven't been very favorable, i feel like the concept of queendom just doesn't really mesh with bom's skills/performance type. still she's doing so well even when it must be hard for her all alone
=
I miss 2nd gen ggs especially snsd and 2ne1
Imagine a 
Bom with jessica or tiffany collab
Or
Taeyon with cl collab
If that happens the internet world and south korea will explode
=
Green 
=
what a queen
=
I love you bommie 
=
I’ve always said this since this song was released but it should’ve been a 2NE1 song and damn I was right even if it’s just bommie it’s still 2NE1 
=
Thats the Queen of sit while singing the one and only 
"PARKBOM UNNIE"
Me at midnight : goosebump..
=
Bommie you made me cry again this song hits me right in the feels.. and that contemporary dancer is so graceful and hot at the same time
=
Is it just me that hears Sandara park in 3:49?
=
everytime bom perform I can feel the emotion within the song. She's really something eversince.
=
speechless
=
I know that mnet and yg is not in the good term but please mnet i promise that if you give 2ne1 one performance in one stage together mnet will be so successful i promise that and im so sure of that please give them just one performance together and they can be the most sucessfull group in the world
=
I miss 2ne1
=
These are the 2NE1 references of this Performances:
1)Her iconic Red Hair at MAMA 2015❤
2)Her dance at the end is the choreo of "In the Club)
3)She have a mic stand and adds another 3 with 3 mics on them colour...
CL
Dara
Minzy
And Bom's mic 
4)The outfits of her 3 dancers are the outfits of Crush era or more specifically there outfit at Mama 2015
5)The hairstyle and Haircolour of the dancers represents CL Dara and Minzy
6)At the end when she rises up symbolizes her iconic intro and her pose at Mama 2015 and does the same pose too 
7)The floor stage symbolizes the cover of 2NE1 first album
Edit:8) the clock ticks 13 times that symbolizes Park Bom music career back at 2006 till now...
9) Whe she gets lift the stage colour is purple pinkish that is 2NE1 colour
10) From the song she sings "The word "Goodbye made me hide and cry all night" She is referencing Goodbye there last song as 3 members of 2NE1
11)Bom at the end does a mic drop symbolizes CL when at there end of the concert she dropped her mic
12) All an all this is Bom's answer to 2NE1 Goodbye and how she misses her members and the times they were togetherAnd how she wishes to return to those memories..
=
Who is here after listening to cl rewind?
=
I don't think people understand how powerful this performance is.
=
I like her final stage. She's not that typical who will perform with a strong concept and to impress others. But instead she performed to express herself and her feelings.
=
Parkbom is nominated for Best vocal solo performance in MAMA 2019! Please vote her 
=
She didn’t do this for the competition she did for herself and us her fans. The emotion she shows here is magical. ❤️
=
My grandma says you can never win a competition when you carry a heartbreak.. But you can win and gain hearts that knew the weight of your longing..
=
All of BLACKJACKs/Bomshells know what bom wants to tell to whom with this song.
=
Girl did high notes without an earpiece..
Bom is not a legend

She in god tier
=
CL's reply was "rewind" she wants to comeback too..
=
Queendom did her bad. She deserves MORE than this! She was a member of the most powerful group 2ne1! It was LEGENDARY and even as a solo artist she's standing strong! You can do it Bom! Fighting!!!
=
Its crazy how she didn’t win queendom when her voice, presence, stage appearance, is just spot on every single F****! TIME!! It’s very sad to see how people can’t really appreciate raw true talent. Park bom won queendom in my reality! Ugh this just upsets me because that song gave out so much emotion you can tell she put her souls into it and you can feel and sense where she was coming from!! Blackjack foreva
=
This is such a genuine performance. She’s telling a story and not trying to win
=
Now I realized that her every performance in this show is all about her and her 2NE1 girls.
=
She's not just a Queen anymore, she's a Legend.
=
Park bom: wanna go back
Cl: Lets go back
=
Park bom : Wanna go back
CL : lets go back 

Ah my heart 
=
She's trying so hard to tell everyone that she misses 2NE1. Exactly how, we, Blackjacks feels. We want them back. No matter how many years passed by, we still want them.
Love you: Bom, Dara, CL, Minzy 
=
When she sang 'i wanna go back" as she passes by the coloured mic. im in TEARS
=
She missed the moment friendship Not the popular things
=
WE NEED 2NE1 ON MAMA 2019!! Who's with me? 
=
Let's just appreciate the fact that CL too make "rewind" and stating let's start again~ 2NE1 Reunited anyone?
=
I don't know but I feel like crying when I watch this.. 
=
In light of recent tragic events, this performance really drives it home for me how our idols are affected when their group breaks up. After decades of living and training together like a close-knit family, all of a sudden everything changes, and everyone goes off to their own projects. The only way of life they have ever really known simply ends. How does one get over something like that, no matter how rich and successful? I do not presume to understand how they feel, but from what little I do understand, it must be horrific. I have the utmost respect for Park Bom for showing her feelings so openly and with such power, and I truly wish that she and her girls find their way back together again. This performance goes straight to my "most memorable" list.
=
They did her so dirty..... Bom had the most emotion and she seemed so deticated
=
Now I know the story behind the coloured microphones it is so touching..
=
She really wanted 2ne1 to continue but fate tore them apart and now she's standing alone in a stage without her members
=
So did anyone notice how at one point her earpiece fell out and she was trying to put it back in but she never succeeded? She still managed to sing beautifully and hit that high note, what a queen
=
I can't tell how many times i've watched this and still get goosebumps.
=
She is a living legend. She doesn't have to win.. she already won our respect and even more.
=
Bommie noona said: “neo (minzy) neo (CL) neo (dara) miss you so much”

Really miss 2NE1 God :(
=
I think she's won already by having friends with her juniors and that's what most important.
=
The clock ticks 13 times. Bom was a trainee of YG 13 years ago. Wow
=
she didn’t win queendom, but honestly this song was the most emotional after all she been through. and as other said, yep she didn’t deserve the last place. anyway she won my heart and i hope she’s not disappointed
=
And now, everything has become a reality. Bommie and Dara comeback, CL comeback. What we need to do is wait for Minzy. Our girls, come back home.
=
Almost make me cry because her insecurity and feelings are so real here
=
who comeback here after CL released Rewind mv
=
I think she means she wanna go back with her 2ne1 members
=
The girl represents her during her hiatus, as she covered her physical appearance conveying Park bom's concealment away from the society during that 5 year hiatus. As the girl started to dance, her movements emphasises bom's breaking out of her shell, trying to regain her confidence in what she does best - which is to sing again. Halfway through the video, the other 3 microphones clearly represent the other 3 2NE1 members, accentuating on the fact that Park bom has never forgotten them, in fact  they'd always been her backbone eversince her comeback. 
this is in fact one of the greatest comeback ever!
=
BLACKJACKS Y BOMSHELLS 
VAMOS POR 2 MILLIONES DE VISTA!!!
=
I pray that she'll make a music video for Wanna Go Back.
=
Mamamoo win the queendom, but this performance won my heart.
=
Her highnote in this song... I think that is the highest she ever reach... Im crying rn
=
Park Bom will release her comeback "First Snow" on December 10 feat. Sandara Park!
=
Park bon is nominated for best solo performance at 2019 mama go vote for her here - 2019mama.com

=
Park Bom is Telling she misses 2ne1, her song has a story. SHE IS THE WINNER
=
The clock ticks 13x... that's exactly 13 yrs ago when she began her musical career. Goosebumps!
=
I'm still not over people betraying her in the media but I never will be. I am so glad she got back up o stage. She's goddamn amazing and a STAR
=
Stan a Queen Stan Park Bom
=
This performance is one Ill love its just not a performance,  it was memories Bom unnie had throughtout her years as a singer and that is so creative to put it into a song, FOREVER A BLACKJACK 
=
She is legend. I literally cried watching this. She already won.
=
I'll be here
I'll wait til you come back
-Bom
Minzy left her agency
CL left YG
What does this meaaaannn
=
I never see any girl group in this world has a good connection like 2ne1. Cuz they are like a real family to each other.
=
She really like a queen....
I think the final 1st is her.... Although I'm a fan of mamamoo...
=
SHE'S NOT COMPETING, SHE'S JUST SERVING US ART ALL THIS TIME!!!!
=
Entendí la referencia 
=
2:02 "just one more time" she missed her group so much 
=
That's what we need in KPOP
=
2:09 " I still miss our last day together " 
=
I've watched this like 5 times in the last 24hrs and it makes me cry everytime I hear it
=
OMG HER VOICE IS AMAZING SHE MAKE ME CRY, I LOVE HER VOICE SHE IS UNIQUE
=
I cried when she hitted that high notes.
=
She doesn’t need to prove anything we all know that she is the Queen
=
my queen
=
Stan Talent Stan Park Bom❤️
=
This is such a powerful performance. I'm left in a mess of tears and feelings. I'm still not over 2NE1's disbandment...  I'm so, so upset.
=
This performance is a behind the scenes of her life after 2NE1:
She begins with hiding her face in shame singing “I’ve lost my way”, afraid of the harsh words of the public as she reflects at her past self 
She then finds the courage to stand up again and not hide her face, to sing again without her fellow members
She then finally rises to the top because she’s found her way back while still representing all that 2NE1 was and who SHE IS. A TRUE QUEEN AND WE CANT FORGET THAT HIGH NOTE 
It’s such an emotional performance I know I can’t hold back the tears 
=
Award winning performance !!! So full of feelings so charming !! Her voice was the best ! Her looks stunning ! I connected so deeply with her performance and the lyrics. She’s a goddess indeed! She’s been trough so much and she’s grown so much she’s so strong ! We love you Bom unnie  you are our Queen ❤️
=
Don't understand how she ended up last in ranking... but I'm not bitter about it because that wouldn't be fair to all the other Queens.
It's just that Bom is goddess ha!
=
The four mics are 2NE1 .
=
1:36 Aren't we gonna talk how badly she wanted to be with her ladies on this show? *DAMN* Why can you just let Park Bom reunited with 2ne1?! She may not win, but she deserve a stage with her Group members! 
=
2NE1 is one of the groups that got me started in K-pop, just after they debuted.  It seems so long ago, now.
No surprise, I have grown older, just as Park Bom has.  This song cuts deeply.  I want to return to that past along with her.
I adore this song.
=
It was like a beautiful classical opera stage.  
Her vocal is the only one in the world.
Her stage concept is only one, too.
This uniqueness makes me always thinking of her and waiting for her.
=
Woaah. I'm crying again ♠️♦️♣️♥️
=
Oh my God, i felt sad
Its 2ne1!!!
=
Fudge I really cried.. I can't take the reality that my queens are not in same group
=
*I WANT A 2NE1 STAGE REUNION AT MNET ASIAN MUSIC AWARDS 2019*
_do you want it too?_
let's hope & pray...
=
Here's the thing: this whole performance is an entire production worth a MAMA stage. It doesn't even feel as if she's competing, zero competition vibe just her performing as if she's promoting it on normal music shows or an award show and that is that. That's amazing
=
From what i can glimpse, 2NE1s breakup, and her scandal have left a gaping hole in her heart, that is still healing.
I believe she is writing music to heal her soul,  her voice is so sad and painful, but at the same time overflowing with beauty.
This entire stage is her trying to relieve her best moments, but at the same time realizing there is no way to go back to those innocent days.
Park Bom deserves the world.
=
i love this song :,3
=
After all this time her vocals still shines!!!! So crisp and clean!!
=
I CRIED SO HARD AND STILL CRYINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG BOMIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
=
I missed park bom's voice
=
Seeing those colored mics, I'm crying ❤️
=
Do you know why it hurts and still it hurts us ? Coz we know how much they love performing together but their company dropped them without  knowing anything...
=
When the 1st mic appear, I cried so hard. It was just 3 mics and back up dancers that represent the rest of 2ne1 members but I cried so hard everytime I watch this performance. Why? ♠️♦️♣️♥️
=
This perform just try to present that her really miss with her grup, hope it someday can be perform together again
=
I have watched this performance a few times now. Some things are remarkebale. But the one thing that gets me every time is Bom looking into the camera at the beginning. All this talk about being a queen.... rankings and votes.... It really does not matter.
Thank you for coming back, conveying your message and staying strong, Bom. You truly are the best! This was glorious!
=
I’m literally crying
I miss 2NE1 too much...
=
damn it! I cried so hard watching this. I hope 2ne1 can stand and sing on the same stage again.
=
When I see the 4 mic I was like wow.. I feel the 2ne1 is reunite with her performance the 3 members sang with her too..... I Love them
=
All times I see this performance, my heart broke in a million of pieces. I have never seen a disbanded group so alive like yours... 2ne1 FOREVER, THE ORIGINAL QUEEN!
=
yall want 2NE1 stage on MAMA 2019 yet some of yall cant even vote for her to win on MAMA
=
Even though Park Bom didn't place first place, she'll always be first place in my heart...
=
I'm so proud of u queen
=
Damn... I have no words only tears 
=
I've watched it again and again since the day this video was uploaded
Like if you do it
=
Whenever Bom sings in Queendom, I am always in tears. But the moment I saw the mic stands, I sobbed. Bom is missing her members, it is all written on the song. Bom, you are the QUEEN. No questions asked.
=
I swear I started to cry a lot when I saw those microphones...
=
This video deserves to have more than 2m views
=
Damn, this girl is blessed with that voice.  One of the best of South Korea, definitely.
=
In this Last Performance she wanted to let go of everything and finally be in peace with herself.
=
Win or lose shes still the queen of all
=
 SO TOUCHING 
=
That mics! 
=
I love her more when she just sing her heart out.. Conveying a story of utterly longing emotions, heartache and that strength pursuing something she had lost.. I just felt it every time my spring queen..
=
I saw the presentation of the theme in the Queendom and the moment when the 4 microphones are shown, it simply broke me in a thousand pieces, because for me they represented the 2NE1 girls, it also made me think of one of the queendom episodes when all the groups They were writing their songs and then Park Bom was sitting alone in the center of the practice room and said she felt lonely and missed the girls. This song, even though I don't speak Korean, managed to convey all those feelings to me and that's why I love her. Please give a lot of love to this song that is pure art. 
=
The four mic with the same color makes me feel shocked. You might not have win in this competition but your always a queen in my Heart.  From a real Blackjack :)
=
This song breaks my heart 
=
Omg im crying
=
While watching her performance I am missing 2ne1 more. Crying af 
=
Oh my God I love you♥
=
Win it or not, you will forever be our Queen! The song is truly amazing and full of emotion. Never tired listening to this.
=
3 empty mic when she walking to the middle perfectly saying she missed 2NE1 as a whole. Blackjacks forever!!
=
Bom always has the most moving and heartfelt performances and she really gives her all every time she’s amazing and so brave for going on this show by herself!! I love her she won to me
=
I'm crying.  2NE1 will always be the best. ❤
=
Tears filled my eyes as I saw the four microphone stands.
=
The one and only Queen BOM  the best forever with you baby 2NE1 always in my heart ♠️♣️♥️♦️
=
Oh yes, when I See Those 4 Mics Together... my Blackjack heart 
=
WHAT THIS IS AMAZING OMG
=
This was not a simple performance, this was a whole TRIBUTE❤❤
=
Go go go 2M is coming❤️
=
the emotions she must have been feeling as she was performing this i’d be having a breakdown on stage and there she is, singing her heart out. shes my role model.
=
THE CONCEPT IT'S ALL ABOUT 2NE1!!!!! ❤
=
I love you so much park bom! 
I miss 2ne1 so so much.
I cried watching this, i feel her emotion so much with this song.
Ill always be a fan 
=
this is just so precious uwu~ the meaning behind this is so priceless~ park bom sunbae is already a winner here~♡
=
Thank you for this, Bom 
=
I don’t know much about the history of 2ne1, but damn this performance has so much soul and story, it makes me feel heavy hearted. Like I hope she gets what she misses. She seems so heartbroken and sad!!
=
These are the people who already voted her on MAMA 2019.
  I
 V
=
I never cried so much in my life
=
This song makes me wanna cry 
=
This reminds me alot Of 2ne1 ❤️
=
the dance she was dancing on the last part of the song is the dance for their song 'In the Club', one of their first songs.
=
I'm crying uncontrollably  this hit hard.
=
You are THE ORIGINAL QUEEN! I cried a lot! You are so beautiful! You deserve all, MY QUEEN! ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU!! I ALWAYS LOVE YOU❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Thank you queen Bom! Thank you for coming back this year and blessing us with all this music! Thank you for being strong all these years and believing in yourself! You are our angel. We love you and support you.
=
Literally crying from the start
=
Ok but can we send some love to d-nation for supporting this amazing woman and fighting for her to be on the stage again, where she belongs. 
=
This stage was truly amazing!! She sounded insanely good. The performance wasn't simply a musical performance it was literal Performance Art!! It 100% conveyed the emotions deeply embedded in this song. Park Bom is phenomenal at conveying her emotions through song. Not only does she emote well her voice is just TOO SPECIAL!! Her vocal tone / vocal color knocks me out EVERY TIME I hear it!! I've been a fan for so long but I am still madly addicted to her voice!! With each release she made this year (like 10 songs total including the Queendom tracks) she has consistently surprised and wowed me with her unique voice and I could not want any more from my Queen. She really delivers as a singer. Wow, what a time to be alive- Park Bom's reign has come! Long live the Queens (2NE1)- they will all be reigning soon enough.
=
I got goosebumps watching this and it makes me feel like she is showing what she went through at YGE and she misses her friendship with 2NE1. I really hope there will be a 2NE1 comeback reunion . Forever a Blackjack♦️♠️♥️♣️
=
The four mics tho- my blackjack heart cant
=
I want to cry 
=
D-Nation please do MV for Wanna Go back.
=
OMG, is this even live?? I missed her vocals so much <3 T_T
=
I cant get over this song, its so beautiful!! Miss the girls!! Blackjack 4ever! ❤
=
4 mics, dance, the way she drop her mic, reminds me of 2ne1. i can't contain my emotions. crying rn :(
=
Damn she threw her mic!!!
I hope the junior idols get out of this performance that if they love being with their group, live in the moment and enjoy every moment.
=
ijust mis them together T_T but im so proud of Bom like everyone <3 lov Bommie <3 and 2ne1 forever T_T <3
=
And CL reply in her song "rewind"
=
I LOVE HER!!!!!! AMAZING!!!! <3
=
This is like 2NE1 reunion omg I'm crying
=
She really misses the group!!  
=
For me this is the most emotional performance I ever saw in my entire life
=
Omg i almost brust into crying when i saw 4 micro
=
I really really love her voice. It's very unique.
=
Im not even a 2NE1 fan What why I feel like get crying 
=
LITERALLY IT IS A CONCERT!
=
I cried when she was surprised with Minzy's video, it was so nostalgic and beautiful 
=
I am crying while watching this. I'm so proud of  QUEEN Bom  this is very emotional for us blackjacks. I miss 2ne1 so bad
=
idk if its just me but i got so many goosebumps and tears just from this simple (yet amazing) performance. once a queen, always a queen.
=
I'm crying  why do u do this to me bommiee? I love you forever queen
=
I cried when i saw the four colored microphones 
=
I cried. That's it. The emotions, the performance, those meanings. ♡♡♡
=
Bom's stages aren't the flashiest, but they are the only ones that move me to tears.
=
Whos here after watching cl new mv? Rewind???
=
MY HEART.
=
She really have a unique voice that others don't have  omg i really love her voice really ❤️
=
I like that there were 4 mic stands and that the 3 dancers somehow resembles her 3 members from 2ne1.. gosh i'm missing 2ne1 big time..
=
I just cried!
I'm adding this on my freaking playlist
=
I'm crying right now ... I don't know so much about 2ne1 but this music ... Made me cry 
=
This made me cry like crazy I miss 2ne1, my teen days
=
I applaud Park Bom for going through this survival show alone, I never thought it was fair for her because she had to come up with her own performance ideas but in a way the quality of her performances reflects how great her mind is and the effort she put in is a first win in my book.
=
QUEEN OF KPOP !
=
Amazing 
=
I’ll never stop loving you Bom 
=
for me, it resounds to my heartbreak! it’s flexible to be situated for everyone’s situations. i love it so much even though it hurts me repeatedly 
=
Park Bom has been underrated during the whole competion
and you can't deny it
She slayed whenever she took the mic
=
The other 3 mic shows it all
=
she is the queen, 2ne1 forever <3
=
why is here after listening to Cl done？
=
I cried too 
=
3:38 
We also want 2NE1 to Go back...
=
Awe the colored mics of the ladies of 2ne1!
=
#2NE1onMAMA2019
We want that so bad, am I right blackjacks?
=
I crieeeeed!  I miss 2ne1! Badly! 
=
I cried so much! I love this song
=
I was crying as soon as minzy gave Bom the video message and I kept crying throughout the whole performance. But as soon as I saw those mics I bawled my eyes out. I love 2ne1 so much and I would literally die for Park Bom
=
 2ne1 2019
=
SHE ALR WON MY HEART SINCE 2NE1 ERA :')
=
OMG I’m soooooo dumb! I’ve watched this for the 50th time and just realised the backup dancers represent the other members of 2NE1!!!!!!!!
=
0:48 did she say, so let me goo, what if this whole preformance refer to what it felt when she was under YG
=
I miss 2NE1 I swear. It's so sad to see Bom as a solo artist now, I hope we get a reunion soon. I'm just glad now CL left YG.
=
All i can say is "i cried "
=
Damn you YG how could you 
=
Bom shoted right in my blackjack heart ♥
=
THE RED HAIR IS EVEN FROM THE LAST TIME THEY PERFORMED AT MAMA T_T
=
this performance makes me believe that 2ne1 will make a reunion concerts one fine day :')
=
This was probably the best performance by park bom. It was so beautiful but also depressing. I will start supporting Park bom for now on because she's actually very talented and an amazing person.
=
Fudge i cried so hard watching this. 
THIS IS 2NE1.  Thank you so much, Bom! I felt that.
=
She's so strong. The first part is clearly her trying to say that understand y'all when y'all say that she needs to dance and move more on stage. She used a dancer to that, and staying in front of the mirror showing that she's thinking, it was heartbreaking. The four mic stands... I can't. I just feel like you Park, and cry too.
=
I cried so much..
=
0:34 ok, im getting emotional
=
YESSSSSSSS QUEEN! SO happy to see my faves coming back! first brown eyed girls and now Park Bom 
=
Ilove her all if the 2ne1
=
She really did her best in every performance at this unfair competition.
She is the sacrifice in this game.
Because no matter how many times she trys, that's impossible for her to create the strong veiws which compare to other girl teams with huge members.
I think she knows the truth, but she still keeps fighting against the truth. Keep going because, in this tough road, I will still support you.( I love your special voice since the beginning of 2ne1)
=
It's broke my heart when I realized that this song didn't win in Queendom, I'm not a fan but this song got me
=
I cried... love you Bom❤️
=
I wish 2ne1 comeback together 
=
Im a big fan of 2ne1 and i will support every one of them even tho they become a solo artist i will support them but still hoping for their comeback as a group. Park Bom youre such a queen i love your song and your voice  were so proud of you and every one of you ❤❤❤
=
Who else watched this over and over
=
*incoherent sobbing noises* 
*drowned in tears*
=
Wow! This is so heartbreaking!! I'm crying so bad!!
=
This is soooooo sad  I Love you 2ne1 Forever ❤❤❤❤
=
Yass 2M❤️
=
Not to sound like i am crapping on the other groups but IMO this is the best out of the whole show. The song and the performance have a deep meaning the artist and not just trying to put of the flashiest show. But I guess it just proves the masses like the catchiest song out there and not one with soul. Think about it in 10-15 years the young girls of the other groups will be singing their own version of Wanna go back. Hopefully when the time comes the public dont just throw them out like they threw out Bom
=
This makes me so emotional.. I have loved 2ne1 since I was 11 and I am now 21.. I grew up with 2ne1 and will forever be a blackjack. Bom won in my heart and will always have a special place in my heart.
=
MY BLACKJACK FEEELS♥️♥️♥️
1.THE 2NE1 MICS
2.THE BACK DANCERS CRUSH OUTFITS
3.IN THE CLUB DANCE DURING THE END
4.THE CLOTH ON THE STAGE IS SAME COLOR / SHADE AS 2NE1 FIRST EP
5.BACK DANCERS DANCING SAME CHOREO AS FIRE BY 2NE1
=
2ne1 …. I ALWAYS LOVE YOU FOREVER... CL BOM DARA MINZY LOVE
=
The lyrics even mention goodbye literally the last song from 2ne1 ....I miss 2ne1 so much
=
3:26 I started sobbing
=
When I saw the 4 colors of her band mates it tells this on my mind that this sing she sung is for her group.
=
4 mics for 4 members of 2NE1 !!! Who miss them :(
=
CL out of YG. Minzy leaving her agency. I smell a 2ne1 comeback... PLEASE!!!! I will pray for this!
=
Does she mean “wanna 2NE1 go back” ? I feel like that when i listen it. Omg!!!
=
كوييين كوييين  بارك بوم كوين 
=
What the heck, the camera really tricked me in the beginning, the other one really looked like Bom when she stood up
=
there is nothing can stop my tears after I watched this....
=
I am crying! This is a piece of art! So emotional! And you can see what an amazing singer she is! Without that earpiece it is so difficult for singers to hit their notes correctly! But she slaaaaayyys!!!
=
We really miss 2ne1 
=
I love that she had 3 backup dancers. Somehow it felt like a 2ne1 performance. I miss them <3
=
this made me hide in my room and cry all day with my cat omg, the power she has i can't 
=
Those mics were used by 2ne1 :( I badly miss them 
=
i feel her emotions :(
=
I’m not crying. The moment that there’s a mic for the members and 3 girls appear with the same costume of 2ne1 Omg i miss theeem
=
This song makes me cry so much and these lyrics 
=
wanna cry, when i saw the 3 mic standing..... bom really want to comeback as 2NE1 again
=
WTF this performance is masterpiece
=
waou ! goosebumps from start to end
love you my queen <3
=
The pure emotion in this performance...
=
Bom u just make me cry  i miss 2ne1 so much. Blackjack here
=
this is the most beautiful final she could give us, thank you, thank you, thank you unnie, thank you for loving BlackJacks and Bomshells so much
=
The moment I saw the other members mic’s i started crying... miss them so much
=
Her voice so fairy❤️✨
=
My heart 
=
I'm crying !
=
Regardless of the performance, all of Bom’s songs are songs I would actually listen to. Bom has a talent for making music sound good and you can recognize her voice anywhere!
=
I cried the entire performance! My blackjack heart
=
We love you, Park Bom 
=
This performance is already as good as a music video
=
Her voice <3
=
She tried so hard. Parkbom is nominated for Best vocal solo performance in MAMA 2019! Please vote her mnet 2019 vote . You need only sign-in
=
There won't be another voice like Bom
=
Cutest pop star i know ✌️
=
Yasssss queen ❤️
=
Goosebumps 
=
I cried so hard and support for Unnie, even when I saw the colour microphones, which belongs to every 2ne1 members and I miss 2ne1 so much. But she didn't give up and she stood strong for her fans and Minzy supporting her. At first, I thought that there really they're with Bom performance, and at that point, I couldn't hold back my emotion and I was happy for her. She brings me memories of their performance back then, also together on stage. I love you Unnie! I'm a fan of yours. FIGHTING!!!!
=
SHE DID A FCKING G5 LIKE NOTHING WE WON'T APPRECIATE THAT? THAT'S THE HIGHEST NOTE SHE EVER DID I THINK!
=
I'm crying 
=
Omg im literally at work crying. God, i miss 2ne1
=
love it <3
=
I miss that time, too... I miss 2NE1. This performance and this song made me cry like crazy. My eyes are just like waterfalls.
=
Why am i crying
=
This is so sad. And the fact that this could( and probably will)happen to the new YG groups is even more upseting.
=
2ne1 will always be the Legends 
Thank you Park Bom
=
The Queen guesting this show. i love all her performance she is just overqualified also Queen is Queen no matter what award she receive still she's over the top.
=
WE NEED 2NE1 TO SAVE MAMA 2019 IM VOTING HARDD
=
She looks awkward in dancing, but her vocal is no doubt, absolutely amazing and unic.. she deserved better.. before this i don't know who is she, but after Queendom (and search history from her past),i'm in love~  i'm her new fans.. ^^
=
I wish it wasnt just park bom, that it was 2nei performimg with her
=
Me too.. I wanna go back where you, cl,Dara and minzy performe in stage as one  but I know can't go back the time .. but I as a blackjack still love you and waiting that comeback/ last performance in stage ...   
#2ne1
#blackjacks
=
Parkbom Looks like a princess
=
She is my winner ❤
=
THOSE HIGH NOTE ARE LIKE HER EMOTIONSSSSSSSSSSS
=
4 mics..... it break my heart
=
I missed her so much! Growing up I always looked up to 2ne1 as my favorite kpop group. It's the group that introduced me to kpop. Their songs were revolutionary like fire and the solo Bommie did "you and I". You can do it bommie! Fighting!
=
Ohhh damn I am crying 
=
Yeah please! Just one more time, one more day. Let us see 2NE1 singing live again. 
=
Queen ❤️
=

=
This video steals tears from me whenever i see Bom with the other 3 dancers in black... She's legend now~

=
I can only cry during the performance, so proud of her.. i feel you bom, i love 2ne1 and miss you all so much, wish u all the best
=
Your voice is my strength!❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Que hermosa Canción llore... (T_T)
=
Perfectttttt
=
4 mic for 2ne1 member.. I can't 
=
I want to see you come back 2ne1
=
Damn at 2:00 it really hits me tho 
=
i'm crying.. wanna go back to that era, my queens can't be replaced 
=
Te re amo .
=
This breaks my heart. I can’t imagine the longing she feels whenever she performs. It must have hurt her deeply.
=
Red hair really suits her. 
=
She wonnin my heart, MV PLEASE
=
Omg i'm crying
=
Mds referência as meninas do 2ne1! Quando vi os microfones delas, que vontade de chorar ;-;
=
I wish that CL would have watched this....
=
Miss you 2NE1 
=
The real Queen 
=
Did y'all notice those mics?! Those are 2ne1's!!!!!!!
=
love you bom, really love this performance
=
The four microphones... When I heard this song for the first time I inmediately thought about 2NE1 and how hard must be for her to be alone from now on. Bom, you did great and we're very proud of you. I don't care if you win or not, I'm gonna stay by your side and support you no matter what ♡
=
I hope that bom performs this song at mama :(
=
I cry a lot when I watch this video. Park Bom, we miss you so much. 2NE1, we love you so much...
=
Her voice is so beautiful
=
I think this the comeback, the lyrics tell it all.
=
After everything bom has gone through she's still thriving and slaying us with everything she does, I'll never stop supporting my queen
=
The 2ne1 microphones
=
i beg all blackjacks & bombshell please vote for her on mama2019 her ranking is low. she deserves on mama stage please
=
Park Bom for #MAMA2019
=
Omg I cried a lot. I miss you
=
CL Bom Dara Minzy
The Fab Four girls that made it too big
My loves <3
=
0:22 there's 2 of her?!
=
That made me so emo
=
Crying❤️
=
Her confidence is screaming! It's like she's telling everybody that 2NE1 is in her and that she'll continue to fight....✨❤️⭐
=
*we all miss 2ne1*
*bom also misses 2ne1*
*we all wanna go back*
*she also wanna go back*
=
Bom is such a beautiful person!
=
She is the only reason why i watch queendom and now i cry so much after watching her this performance...
=
❤QUEEN❤
=
I cried like turtle watching this T-T
=
She’s filling memories to 2ne1 members and fans. 
She’s really tough and she’s not even competing but i salute of her bravery to stand on stage again and make us finally fill a piece.
=
Her hair make me back to "can't nobody" mv
=
Omg.. My blackjack heart.. The mic colour... Park Bom you are really sincerely idol I never met.. The one who think her member not just a coworker.. Omg 2ne1 deserve to be alive again
=
Park bom voice is amazing really
=
Although I think it is unfair that bom joined this competition, I am somehow glad she did because we get songs like these that makes me cry and moments of her missing 2ne1. I know she misses them but I am glad that she doesn't seem like they never existed.
=
MY QUEEEEEEN!!!!! OHMYGOOOOOD!!!! I LOVE YOU PARK BOM!!!! 
=
Wtf this is so heart breaking I wanna cryyyyyyyy
=
I Stan you 2ne1 and mamamoo unnie , fighting 
=
CL done her part to tell everyone that she loves 2NE1, Dara also always talk about 2NE1, since Queendom Started Bom always reminds us how she misses to perform with her group and in the finale she uses costumes,mics,red hair and also how the stage is designed and done. Minzy teases that she will be the next to have a move to show to everyone that she is not the real reason why 2NE1 disbanded and i hope she do something related to her former group and then i hope they will be reunited and perform together❤️
=
Her voice and emotion in Stage 
Love you our queen ♥️♥️
Blackjacks let us vote Park Bom in MAMA2019 for the Best in Vocal Performance Solo.
Our Queen deserve it.
Park Bom in Mama2019
=
This is a TRUE tribute to 2NE1
=
 I miss 2ne1. Thank you for this great performance Bom.
=
I dreaded and stalled watching this stage for so long because i knew id be a mess after it ... And i was right , fk u queen for maling me cry
=
My heart breaks for Park Bom, we really need 2Ne1 back
=
I cried through and through. I can't stop replaying it and crying. I respect her so much.
=
This is extremely beautiful <3 !!!
=
All of her heart is always 2ne1 
=
I LOVE YOU BOM! 
=
When she referenced Goodbye, it hit harder.
=
This song makes me so sad and happy at the same time .
=
I Hate MNet for not letting the international fans to vote
=
estan los microfonos de 2ne1 omg no estoy llorando
=
M-net is a troll like YG.
they didn't appreciate real talent.
=
OMG I CRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIED SO MUCH
=
Who's still want the blackjacks coming   
=
What I find so amazing about this performance too is that YG silenced 2NE1 from speaking about the disbandment. Park Bom is finally able to get the closure she needed and to finally express how difficult everything had been after their disband through this performance <3 I’m a proud black jack and am hoping for a reunion please!
=
Since the final, I have been playing this all day long, everyday 
=
she really loves her friends :((
=
Those microphones. She didn't have to hurt me this bad 
=
I see bom make a gestur like 2 and 1, its mean like 2ne1 i think
=
we <3 u bom!
=
watching this video has become my daily habit hahaha
=
若い時のボムの姿に見える
=
She really is a queen!

She deserves to win
Her vocals are everything
Her strength.
You are the best
=
Damn. I am crying. Literally crying. I can’t deal. Park Bom has so much emotion on her vocals. I am sorry if she doesn’t win idk what people are doing.
=
Ngak ada yg bisa mengantikan 2ne1!!!
2ne1 forever❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
I’m so sad now :(
=
When I want to cry, I just play this video, the lyrics, the video, the power and the feeling that Park Queen Bom puts in every sentence, step and note, it just makes me burst into tears 
Love You Bommie ❤❤
=
Mano, eu quase chorei assistindo 
Muito emocionante, muito mesmo
=
I need lyrics 
=
i cried along Watching boom performance. .2ne1 love you forever
=
Everytime i saw her on screen how i wish she still with 2ne1 that they would still perform. I always cry whenever i remember how painful it was to think that they already disband.
=
QUEEN OF KPOP
=
Other stages might have been flashier and had more stage action. However this is the only song I find myself coming back to, listening again and again     Queen Bom
=
What's up!We're 2NE1!!
=
Wanna too get back  
=
That Mic drop tho

A días de que mi reina regrese ❣️
#PARKBOMQUEEN
=
holy fucki cried when i saw their mics
=
I listen this song everyday♥️ the perfect ending for her Queendom journey ✨
=
miss you 2ne1 :(
=
I want 2ne1 back ,,,  still can't move on
=
1.3M views in just 2 days. it's crush era once again
=
The only final performance that touched my heart and gave me goosebumps... 
Her voice has pain that she's been through... 
She fell, criticized, despised and hurt numerous times.. ..  but picked herself up, dusted herself and stepped in the battlefield again gaining confidence everyday.. Hatsoff Park Bom ... I support U...
=
Goosebumps
=
Watching this with tears
=
QUEEN!!!
=
She is the true definition of QUEEN,
After all they've went thru, for the love of music and their fans, she doesn't give up.
THAT'S A TRUE QUEEN FOR ME.
=
this was such a beautiful and touching tribute to 2ne1 and blackjacks ❤
=
Queen
=
*I wanna turn back time, I wanna go back*
When she sang that line, dang freaking tears can't stop falling.
=
Queen❤❤❤❤
=
She literally made me break up in tears and broke my hearts twice into a hundred thousand pieces. I'm crying, because she's the nost precious person ever. Love u Park Bom  2ne1 FOREVER
=
i wanna go back ..to time that 2ne1 is still famous ..strong..fAntastic..
i miss them..i cry a lot. when watching this..
#QUEEN
=
This is what a real singer looks like! 
=
I miss 2ne1 :(
=
im trying not to cry, but when those 3 dancers came out on stage representing CL, DARA, and MINZY. i want to go back to those days too.
=
This kind of broke my heart. Such a powerful performance. She doesn't have to win Queendom, she's already a winner to me. Stay strong, unnie!
=
IM CRYING HWAAA
=
Legend
=
Oh god... I need to see them on same stage
=
Queen❤️
=
Kpop fans are toxic. That’s why you can’t have nice things. Basically the moral of this story.
=
I watch Queendom because there was Park Bom and for me she is always the winner. It's her passion that inspires me a lot. She deserves so much better than this.  " If we can't turn back the time, let's walk together till the end of the road "
=
Those mic belongs too :
Gold - CL❤
Purple - MINZY
orange - DARA.
Green - BOM✨
#HOPEFOR2NE1REUNION
#2NE1ONMAMA2019
=
That was a whole serve
=
I miss 2ne1 parkbom comeback fighting❤️❤️ forever❤️❤️❤️
=
she has 4 mic on the the stage.. which represents the members of 2ne1.. can't they just be together again..
=
Awesome 
=
It makes me so emotional to see such a meaningful performance. The pain that she felt is shown in the performance and it is clear that the way she and the other members were treated still have a huge impact on her. #2ne1forever
=
I miss 2ne1！
=
BEST VOCAL PERFORMANCE
=
Eu nem sou do fandom e chorei, puts
=
Mano,so vi referencias incriveis ao 2ne1 no debut,no MAMA caralho Park boom sempre foda no que faz.Ainda tenho esperanças ao 2ne1 voltar.
=
3:52 !!!!!
=
Im maybe cant be flexible like in the old time but my voice and my soul are always dedicated to music
=
Omg, im gonna cry. The dance moves and the dancers' outfits are literally tribute to 2ne1. Love it!
=
Awesome stage performance :D
=
i want more park bom! bring back 2ne1!
=
Watch this again n again, n im crying again n again...really miss to see them on stage together
#blackjack forever #2ne1♥️
=
that 4 mic stands tho  she wanna go back so much
=
To her.... 2ne1 is her everything.. and it makes me hurt so much.. pls someone bring 2ne1 back..
=
i love you
=
Dang... raw emotion and the feels. Her raw emotion can be heard in this song. I cried while watching. I cried while listening and reading the comments. 
But let's face it. To win in this kind of competition, you have to be sooooo popular and have a large fanbase. Everyone in Queendom is talented. They all have their own color. They don't need a competition to show who's better. They are all queens in their own right. So, who cares in the end who won? Park Bom is saying what she wants. Queens come and go, but like her and everyone in 2ne1 they are Legends.
=
I love Blackjackees so much <3 !!! ^^
=
The set had problem...That wasn’t the first time@@But it didn’t effect her
=
Keep streaming
=
i love you bom always ❤ i love you all my 2ne1 my very first love queens ❤
=
Seriously, despite not understanding Korean, this performace brought me to tears. I badly miss 2NE1 and I just wanna see them come back in one stage. I can feel Bom's struggles and how she misses 2NE1. She's against other powerful, popular and younger groups; however she never quit. Not for herself, but for 2NE1. I hope she moves forward and be stronger. 
I have never stanned any other groups... but if they got a chance to do a reunion concert I would throw any thing else I have now just to see them perform live. We love you BOM! We forever love 2NE1!

PS: It would be fair if they just get all soloists in Queendom, or just all girl groups. This is not fair for Bom. Yet, she gave a legendary stage. She's still number 1 for me here, 2nd is G-idle, then Mamamoo. Don't get me wrong, every group did very well.
=
now let season 2 happen and put top ggs in it..lets see if they can outdo s1 performances..lol..jk..just.wanna.see.them.interact..
=
Who's slicing all these onions?
=
Lloré cuando vi los demás micrófonos.
=
2ne1's disbanment is a drama, it's tragic.
The girls were and they still are really heartbroken.
I am crying with them.
=
Song is so good!
=
The writers of this song really knows 2ne1 and park Bom's story very well and the references from 2NE1's songs like "Goodbye" and "if I were you"
=
OUR QUEEN HAS RISEN. THAT'S THE RESULT OF THIS SHOW. PARK BOM IS FINALLY BACK. CAN'T STOP CRYING CUZ OF THE MICS AND THE MESSAGE OF THIS PERFORMANCE ❤️
=
I cried....oh god, bom....i missed 2ne1
=
cara, park bom sente muita falta das meninas :/ força, meu amor <3
=
I fcking cried. My blackjack heart. Its always never the same without them on the scene 
=
=
I WILL FOREVER STAN YOU AND THE REST OF 2NE1 
=
THE VOICE OF K-POP
=
When i saw the mic, I was expecting for Minzy, Dara, and CL to come out
=
Bom 
=
Park bom didnt need to win because shes already a queen
=
her mic :(
=
I want 2ne1 back 
=
Those high notes gave me goosebumps❤❤❤
=
PLEASE VOTE PARK BOM IN MAMA2019 EVERYDAY!!!!
=
I misss 2ne1 so much
I love you boomiee
=
my blackjack heart 
i wish CL would join her company.. they can do better ❤️❤️❤️
=
the history behind this performance is so sad , I wasn't a fan but I understand the references of 2NE1. She did an amazing performance, I want to cry. She won the heart of the fans
=
I REALLY WISH WE COULD TURN BACK TIME AND STILL HAVE 2NE1. I REALLY MISS THEM. IT HURTS SO BAAAD
=
Wow like she came back with fire am really proud of her 
We love bom no matter what
=
She dance IN THE CLUB choreagraphy at the end and “Oh Oh” also is the lyrics of that song too. I miss them all !!!!
=
Why am i crying? Huhu my blackjack heart. 
=
Love you Bommie. Missing 2NE1 
=
I'm not crying. I'm crying. I miss them so much. I want to see them again someday, in one stage. Singing and performing like there's no tomorrow. I miss My real, Queens ❤ 
Come back home, 2EN1.
=
When she says "you were always beside me" and points to three places 
=
We always wait 2NE1. If they come back,we will bless and welcome.
=
Девочки, нет я не плачу, это просто слезы
=
the fashion stylist for Bom should make her clothes simpler, not much bling bling and jewelries... she's pretty enough... focus some clothes that are easy to handle and not too high heels... and pls make sure her earpiece is secured
=
Like every blackjacks I just miss them all... But happy to see them individually keep on moving. Hope one day they will reunite again all.
=
I CAN'T HOLD MY TEARS WHEN I SAW THE 4 MIC COLORS
=
Bring back 2ne1 pls 
=
So much feels in this song OMG ♥️♥️, she  is a true artist !!  Even with everything that happens to her , she's still fighting back ! Even if she have to do it from the start again  
That what I always love about 2ne1 about park bom in particular , authencity,  no lie , no false personally they are themselves !! 
No offense I like kpop , but they have something authentic that only 2ne1 and big bang had (some members at least ) 
So fighting park you're the true winner
=
Vote Park Bom at Mama 2019 as Best Vocal Performance Solo
=
La Amo, no pude evitar llorar al ver los otros 3 micrófonos , sigue superándose a sí misma, siempre brillando cómo la mágica Estrella que es 
=
She doesn't deserve to be on queendom


She deserves to be where legends perform
=
Go go go QUEEN Bom Park❤
=
I miss 2NE1 so much :((
=
Well, guys, let’s just appreciate that Bommy took a part in this competition and we could enjoy her performances all this time, it’s already a big step for her after hiatus and for us too. 
I was crying and having goosebumps during performance, she nailed it as always, but funny to see her trying to fix earphone back lol
And mic drop was effective end, cuz like Obama she just said I’m done, PERIOD!
It’s hard to win for her after hiatus, and also when other contestants are groups and already having big fanbase, so let’s support her, she made it well
=
3:43
=
✨
=
I am not a big 2ne1 stan and don't exactly know what kinda relationship they all had together but even me, an outstander, can see, hear and feel the pain she is in. I hope she can move on
=
CL and Minzy left their labels, they should both sign with D-nation (bom's label). This would automatically influence dara to leave YG as well, we would have them back, only probably under a different name as petty YG would never sell them 2ne1 copyrights.
=
park bom queen
=
I'm telling y'all I feel like there will gonna be 2NE1 in MAMA 2019 ❤
=
Alwaaayss boomiee noonaa... my alien boom.. my black jack heart 
=
I’m not a Blackjack or a fan of Bom but after seeing all her performance on queendom i definitely became a fan of hers. This song really sends sadness to me. I can feel her because i have also lost people that is very precious to me. I hope she fights bravely and continue to do all her best. I love her so much now.
=
Although her earphone dropped, Bom still sang so good❤
=
there’s always going to be some idiot that’s  going to be like “ she is leaching on to 2ne1”.
She literally poured out her soul, and I felt it.
=
Minzy Reported To Have Filed An Injunction To Suspend Contract With Her Agency
=
Sigh this is sad. I just hope bigbang will leave yg and open up their own company then they take 2ne1 back, lee hi, bi and other talented artist!
=
Park bom my queen please I didn’t need them I miss 2en1 feels but now I crying like a baby thanks love you
=
I am waiting for the MV T.T
=
My Queen is back <3
=
Hermosa ParkBom I love BOM
=
Bring back 2ne1 pleeeeeaaaasse...
=
She didn't win but she stole my heart <3 <3
=
goose bumps all over !
=
naiiyak parin tlga ako everytime nakikita and naririnig ko tu huhuhu
=
it made me cry....
=
Im crying so much
=
I dont think i've ever heard her singing that high in my entire life we are blessed
=
My interpretation:I feel like she’s trying to say that she wishes she could turn back time and perform and make music earlier but she couldn’t (because of yg) but  she can’t turn back time and she had to wait until she could do this again  , ‘ just for one day ‘ she wants to have us and the stage back and do this again and when she’s says when she had to say goodbye ( disband) all she could do is cry . She also saying she misses her fans and we were always by her side  . About the dancing thing of her ‘twin’ I think she’s saying sorry I couldn’t make music from her feelings and heart   instead of this yg music with these catchy dances because it was just a show for almost a brand and money , she also can’t look at her ‘old self /twin ‘because she doesn’t like it (obviously) and it was not her real self, also pointing out the twin/old self was darker which maybe means she was sad at those times  , and as you can see kind of in the video it’ll never be fully her .she also says she trying to hold on to US (the fans)so basically hoping  we won’t leave here. She can’t go back to us when we were waiting for her and maybe she feels like she wanted time and that’s the reason why she wants to turn back time .
=
This is making cry but idk why but it is this gives me memories of 2NE1 for some reason this performance reminds me of 2NE1...
=
Oh my hearth
=
4 Mics... Oh no, I'm crying.
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
Me(before reading the lyrics): Crying
Me(after reading the lyrics) : crying like a waterfall
=
Her performances always make me sad because it's obvious that she never moved on from 2NE1. She relied on them for everything, and now that they're gone, she still feels empty. She's doing so well on her own and I hope she stays strong <3
=
In my opinion,Park Bom's voice is the most beautiful in this season. Dont bash me ok.
=
You can tell she misses 2NE1 so much, I’m so proud of her for coming back though. Still as amazing as ever!
=
Escuchan eso?
Es mi corazón rompiéndose en mil pedacitos.
=
I'm crying
=
We need 2NE1 in mama 2019
=
I'm crying
=
Guys.. Don't forget to vote Park Bom for MAMA every day using all your sosial media account.. She been nominated for 3 categories..
=
I'm crying
=
僕が泣いた。
ブラーボー　ボムちゃん！#2NE1#BLACKJACK #4EVER
=
So sad for bom!! :( alone
=
This is so meaningful. I'm a 2ne1 fan and I miss them together, how it must be painful for her, that always had the girls to support and give strength. But now she is alone on the stage.... Anyway, we are here for you Boomie... You did amazing!
=
This broke my heart in so many ways
=
The thing she couldn't overcome was her popularity in Korea especially with the new generation. If they had allowed International Fans to participate she would not have finished last. They should have all lady soloists from her generation to  be fair. So maybe Taeyeon, Sunmi, Gummy, Yubin and then for excitement, invite Minzy! Any suggestions?
=
An emotional song for every blackjacks. I miss the group. 2NE1 was the best, and right now, all I can do is to support them in each of their endeavor.
=
♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
 aku nangis lihat perform nya park bom unnie , jadi kangen 2ne1
=
goosebumps
=
Mdss QUE MULHER!!
=
2ne1 still alive
=
I missed 2NE1
=
are we not gonna talk about the 3 mics? Who's crying? HUHUHU
=
This is the only song that's giving me chills and goosebumps
=
bom appreciate 2ne1 so much, same goes to other members, please make the reunion concert happens
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
❤️
=
I'm not a 2ne1 fan, but knowing how it ended for them makes me so sad, and watching this makes me so sad for them, and I'm starting to tear up. Poor Bom
=
She's totally back
=
幫忙分享一下各位 這首真的唱到心坎去餒
=
This was a moving/emotional performance. I love Bom and I loved 2NE1....the only error that I see in this performance was that the Dara and CL dancers had the wrong color mics. I think they should of swapped them when they came close to each other but other than that, this was a WELL put together performance. Congratulations to Mamamoo for winning but Park Bom won my heart.
=
IT'S ABOUT 2NE1 HWAAA I get goosebumps when she  show the other mic that 2ne1 use:''''  MISS OUR GIRLS
=
Haha and people said that her voice is damaged and will get damage this is a BIG BITCH SLAP to you 10 years in the music industry and here she is Living and Slayin❤❤❤
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
Wow   park bom  ️
=
2ne1 please comeback
=
Plz bom-ah change the stylist !
=
OMG I cried while watching this performance 
=
Park Bom's voice is her biggest weapon. She has successfully proven her real value in this show. Park Bom is not just a vocalist of 2ne1 but also one of the renowned female singers in K pop world. Someone may deny her  efforts but not for her distinctive voice.  That's Park Bom we have always known
=
Its like shes in MAMA 2019
=
I luv u park bom!!
=
2NE1 ... come back please.
=
1:56 the stage refer to 2NE1's stage , the four members
=
the girls were dressed to look like the others in 2ne1 too
=
That last part when she was like:
Throw mic and... ¡Pose!
Yeeeeeeeess!
=
syit im crying
=
True winner❤ always a winner in our hearts❤❤❤❤
=
Dia selalu sedih kalau ingat 2NE1.
=
im crying wtf
=
its cute seeing her struggling with her earpiece even though she slayed the high note
=
love BOM
=
We will continue to love you no matter what.
=
queen i cried
=
THIS IS SO POWERFUL, OMG IM CRYING.
When I saw the MIC COLORS LINED UP I TEARED UP then when the girls walked in I WAS OVER WITH. 
Forever my bias, I dont even care if she doesnt win, she has made a statment and she has risen like the PHOENIX SHE IS. 
Hopefully we can see a 2NE1 reunion soon, I couldnt see it happening before but now I CAN SEE IT HAPPENING!

PARK BOM FIGHTING.
=
Her performances have been so meaningful for this show. Shes doing something completely different and it showcases her beauty and talent in the best way possible. Also the creative direction of the mirror scene and 2ne1 members had me like  hair is on point and ending expression fierce as fuck. God i love her.
=
Bom this way
=
The 4 mics, the dancers coming out to represent 21, the fabric on the floor reminiscent of 21s first mini album, the dance Bom did similar to one of their dances ugh I can’t this is so emotional for blackjacks 
=
Suatu kehormatan bagiku menjadi fans mu  kau adalah yang terbaik
PARK BOM  dan tak kan pernah tergantikan oleh siapapun  karna kau unik dan satu2 nya park bom haha haha ha SEMANGAT ! Jangan menyerah karna kami akan selalu bersama mu !!
#BOMSHELLFOREVER 
#2NE1BLACKJACKFOREVER
=
Me encanta el es genial park bom  es increíble pero cada vez que lo veo me hace llorar por qué recuerdo mucho el amor que le tengo a 2ne1 y no verlas juntas eso me hace ponerme triste y feliz a la ves bom  siempre nos hace saber que las blackjack siempre estarán 
=
Wow very strong sound
=
im crying thanx
=
Damn knowing the history of 2NE1 and scandals this makes it very emotional and touching.
=
COMO NAO CHORAR COM ESSA APRESENTAÇÃO???? MDS..
=
When tears fall out of nowhere as soon as the 3 dancers take the mics, we need to have them back. We just need 2NE1 again. 
=
2ne1 will comeback.
=
Who else have noticed that the color of the mic is the same with her members' mic. Gold, Purple and Orange. Not same shade but same color. 

Don't touch me I'm crying.
=
COME BACK HOME 2NE1 .....
=
I thought 2NE1 was coming back at 01:36
=
2NE1’s disbandment is still by far the most tragic and emotional one...
=
i’ve been having on repeat this song since it came out, somehow i knew what she wanted to tell us through the lyrics and the performance confirmed my theory.
she’s talking to her old-self and to the girls, everything she’s been through, the bad and happy moments she embrace everything. 
that bittersweet feelings of wanting to go back in time will forever remain inside every human being, but at some point in your life, you have to move on and look forward, especially if you’ve been burned out really badly by life. and i think that’s what bom did in queendom, she started with you and i and ended this journey with wanna go back, she will always remember her career and her time with 2NE1 as happy memories but now it’s time for her to shine solo, to show everyone that she is not a bad person, she’s more than just a kpop idol.
also someone on twitter pointed out how the clock ticks 13 times back which would take her to 2006, when she first started singing as park bom from yg and at that point she rise dancing (randomly if you will) the in the club choreo. 
2NE1 debuted in 2009, as we’re leaving 2019 and entering 2020, i think everything will be different for bom, she has a new life now, a new agency, she made new friends through queendom and she has her music career back, which she worked so hard for.
i’m happy, this competition did good to her, she’s once again a new bom, ready to embrace a new path with so many new memories waiting for her in the future, keep on singing bom, we’re proud of you!
=
I`m just literally crying 
Miss 2ne1
=
I'm literally crying now
=
I need some Blackjack loving 
=
That mics 
=
2NE1  De las mejores canciones de Bom en Queendom 
=
i had goosebumps when I saw there were three other colored mics on the stage ; ;
=
I keep coming back to watch this performance, it's so captivating.
=
I'm hating to those who made 2ne1 disbanded  everytime I watch how 2ne1 members suffered a lot
=
It's kinda good that they just revealed first and second place for the final ranking, because we don't need to show who is last or whatever. Many of us came cheering for 1 group or a couple, but we soon realised they are all worthy queens and the show is just meant to show us that. I wouldn't have looked at Oh My Girl and Lovelyz because I thought they were the generic, happy, cheerleading, bubbly girl group. Through the show, Oh My Girl showed me so much more than that, and Lovelyz showed me that cutesy is not bad of a genre at all! Their Cameo performance was so splendidly sweet! We know all 6 are queen-worthy, and I'm delighted Mnet created this show. For once, they couldn't do any evil editing because some fandom's gonna beat their ass if they did hahaha.
=
Omg thisssss is sooo hurting
=
She is so cute OMG
=
I’d be so down if Jay Park signs Park Bom to AOMG. 3rd girl artist along with Hoody & Sogumm! 
=
謝謝春帶來這麼棒的表演，想你21妞們，陪伴我青春時期的女團 ❤
=
It's so painful to watch 
=
you are always being my queen :((  omg i miss 2NE1, miss my queen
=
Bomie poured her whole heart in this performance. She's so strong and this song is painfully beautiful, made me miss 2ne1 more and remembered all their struggles and hardships each of them went through. Park Bom, you're a real Queen.

Here again watching this epic performance and wondering about:
1. Who composed the song? The lyrics is just too precious. And whenever the word Goodbye is mentioned, my mind just flashbacks to the last mv of 2ne1-Goodbye (2017). This is probably my 2nd saddest song after Goodbye.
2. Who planned the whole production? It’s an EPIC TRIBUTE to a LEGENDARY GROUP not just a performance. Every detail is a poignant memory for us who have been with them since the beginning.
> first part where she is looking into the mirror and reminiscing her past self, where she was at her peak performance or maybe we can call it MONSTER ROOKIES era  (when she dances and she was at her healthiest bodywise, but the choreo reminds me of i love you era but not exactly the same )
> second part when she joined the ICONIC MICROPHONE since their Nolza concert, their SIGNaTURE HAiR from MAMA 2015 and ROYAL ATTIRE from AON world tour opening which is black and gold.
>third part where everything was combined into one:
1. the silver cloth and maybe the silver attire which is the color and lettering of 2ne1 first album.
2. Ofcourse her green microphone since 2010
3. Her hair color and her pose while being raised is all from MAMA 2015
4. In the club choreo
5. The lights dancing in the air reminds me of the final part of Crush MV when they were shouting Nolza with fistpumps in the air and they were also elevated from others.
6. Her final pose. I’ve been searching but have never seen HER do this pose. BUT in every final pose of 2ne1 in their performances, it’s either they all line up with 2NE1/LOVE(from DYLM era) hand sign OR one of them is doing this pose while the other 3 are standing in the back. I have seen CL with this pose for Fire, Dara in Gotta be You and Minzy for MAMA 2015. This is the only time I see Bom with this pose probably because she is known to wear short skirts.
Nolza FOURever ♠️♦️♣️♥️
=
This is so emotional. A finale only a queen can give.
=
Did you see the 3 mics? I cried!
=
For fans who don’t know, the dance that park bom dance at last is from 2ne1 first mini album - in the club
=
i looooove all the performances but bom's performance is the most emotional and heartbreaking.
=
a queen. periodt.
=
BLACKJACKS WE NEED 2NE1 STAGE IN MAMA 2019!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
Am I the only one who noticed that thos 3 back up dancers is like representing the othrr members of 2ne1 and the lyrics of the song is like Park Bom's song for 2ne1? My blackjack heart omg
=
OmgShe put 4 mics on the stage...just like 2ne1 was there.
=
She really misses 2ne1, you can feel the sensation of missing someone in the whole song, she created a presentation worthy of the MamA she will do something amazing there 
=
That’s what you call a singer when you’re watching it through the screen but can feel all them emotions...
=
She only conquer the stage using her voice and emotion 
=
Yes. She is my Queen.
=
=
I burst into tears when this performance came on for Queendom. You should have scored way higher Bommie! <3
=
I wish she
Was a winner
=
♥️♥️♥️
=
Our baby
=
FOREVER QUEEN!
=
Love her. 
=
Man, there is so much meaning behind this and it makes it so much more heartfelt because there is a real story, real raw emotions behind it all.
=
Love u Park BOM
=
I see 2ne1 in this performance
.. 4 mics ... 4 colors... 4 costumes
=
Meudeus me arrepiei, Bom sempre surpreende. ♥️
=
Joder!!!! Después de tantos años se puso mas hermosa!!!!!
=
You are my queen
=
Next time 2ne1 time to comeback..pls give us chance.
=
I love the imagery.
=
Salut sama park boom udah berusaha dari nol lg.. Dan luar biasa usahanya. Sukses terus park boom 
=
preguiçosa kkkkkkk
=
4 mics
=
I badly want to see 2NE1 together again huhuhu
=
When you confuse for 1st minute which one is bom 
=
Notice the mc introduced Bom as legendary? That's right,  she is here to boost viewership and ratings, so no ranking needed for her as she is only here to showcase the best performance!
=
This song is stuck in my head right now. I been here when this episode came out. But now I’m ad addicted to this song
=
Now I know eventhough there’re many stars but she is the brightest one!
=
Proud fan u gave ur heart and more in this song
=
I watched the entire show just this past weekend and I am so disappointed that she wasn't place higher. The people of Korea who did noy vote for her are seriously deaf and blind and or just still mad to be mad at her for her "scandal"... This girl did extremely great all by herself... She sang her heart out... showed so much emotions and she gets 5th and 6th?! This show is straight bs from the start! This performance was everything! Bom won in my eyes. I wouldn't had watched the shoe if it wasn't for her! Thank you Bom for returning to the stage. I know it's hard, but hang in there! Justice will be serve to all 2ne1 members and blackjacks. My heart still hurts. To had waited for a comeback especially after MAMA performance and got disbanded news instead. Love you Bommie!! YOU ARE A LEGEND!!
=
only queens 2ne1 can drop their mic hahahhaha
=
صيره يمينه  كلش اسفه
=
CRUSH OUTFITS! 
The In the club choreo in the end!! 
QUEEN EVEN IF YOU DIDN’T WIN! YOU’RE STILL OUR QUEEN!
=
Bom, nós também sentimos falta do 2NE1...
=
That signatures red hair of Bom is back.
Those four mics and its individual colors.
The four dancers with the same outfit and hair as CL, Dara and Minzy 
=
=
I CANT HOLD MY TEARS BACK. THIS MADE ME CRY. I MISS 2NE1 SO MUCH. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
UUUUUUUGGGHHHH MY HEART! I didn’t tear up the whole time I swear
=
Love BOM, love her Talent & her Strong heart. from a (G)I-DLE's fan.
=
"I'll be here till the day you come back. I'll be waiting for you"
=
this song is a masterpiece and it reminds me of the good time when 2NE1 are active with 4 girls:((
=
Have y'all noticed that she dropped the mic at the end before she posed? ICONIC
=
Im just crying  I just can’t believe 2NE1 disbanded, it breaks my heart so much just to think about it and this song is just everything to me 
Hopefully they could perform one day again on stage ✨❤️✨
=
when i realized the the mics and the girls were supposed to signify the group back together i bawled
=
I can't stop my tears 
=
Oh my god ! Im crying right now 
I miss 2ne1 
=
Crying while watching this. ❤️
=
I can't turn back time
I can't go back ......
I wanna turn back time
I wanna go back
The lyrics of this song says it all. We miss u too soooo much #2ne1 #BlackjacksFourever #ComeBackHome #QUEENS #LEGENDS
=
I miss that red hair and the legendary mic omggggg 
=
The color of microphone makes me cry
=
wanna go back to the era when 2NE1 was dominating.. 

be strong bom. we blackjack will support you all the way same with the other girls. 
ps. i love this music so bad
=
her voice is so unique❤❤❤❤
=
Tha part with 4 microphones made me cry
=
This is so heartbreaking
=
The iconic voice, you win my ears 
=
My blackjack heart❤️❤️❤️
=
When I saw the mics, sh*t I cried so much.
=
 I really miss 2ne1..I feel u bom how u miss them...I watch bom tears cnt stop....
=
4 coloured mics, lyrics. Definitely delicated to 2NE1, much misses❤
=
I wanted to watch this without the lyrics and I started to get tears in my eyes. So emotional eventhough I dont understand the language. I love this girl so much and she deserves the love and respect of the size of the universe!
=
The reason why I still stay as a fan of any k-artist in this industry because I was really hoping that one day, 2ne1 will able to rise again. They will revive again the feels of the Golden Era. My childhood memories of that Era. I still wanted to trust that they will shake the kpop world.
 I will always love you bom  You will be always be a Queen 
=
Loop again and again
Omg
Sooo gooood
My park bom
So proud of you
=
Hoping for the come back of 2ne1 really miss them so much
=
LEGENDS MAKE US ALL CRY 
=
Bommie looks amazing! Missed this ghetto red hair lol. Shout-out to to old days, thankful for the bops and the looks and 2ne1 tv.
=
she never fails to make me cry
=
I loved this 2ne1 reference with the other 3 girls on stage with their personal color microphones <3
=
I’m not a 2ne1 fan but this performance just made me cry. This is a PERFORMANCE
=
OMG MY HEART CAN'T RELATE HUWEE
=
She want go back, with 2ne1 and their fans. She miss them. It make me emotional when watch her performance.
=
When i hear parkbom , i hear 2NE1 ,,, park bom love you ❤️❤️
=
This song has soo much feels and 2ne1 hints
=
she really miss 2ne1.... we missss 2ne1
=
here i am crying and missing our queens.
=
She's a queeen already
=
Omg
=
Love you music ❤
=
this song really make me happy and sad at the same time. this song really resonate her feeling missing 2ne1 so bad but she is getting fine now. I feel so proud of you Park Bom.
=
I cried like a dog
=
I REALLY MISS 2NE1
=
I Love 2ne1！Park Bom  別在偷吃零食
=
I really want to watch MV of this song❤️
=
Did you see that 3 girls dancing instead of dara, minzy, and cl
=
OMG!!!!! :(((((((
=
She is amazing. Even she is on the last place. She won over millions of hearts
=
She may not win, but she wins my heart ❤️ blackjack forever
=
omg i can't. I'm literally crying non-stop because of this it's so sad. 3 mikes with the 3 girls dancing in the same outfits as the members in their last performance, the beginning of the song where she sits in front of the mirror while the dancer who looks like her showing how even though she's hurting so much she still performs and oh my god the lyrics.
I'm ugly crying right now
=
what's up，we‘re 2ne1!!!
=
Og my god... my blackjack heart... minji, Cl , dara signature mic there
=
Queen BOM!
=
Omy  She really misses 2ne1 by telling on her song
=
that green mike though
=
Bom whyyyyy
=
Even I don't  understand what she sings but why I'm crying
=
look at those mics and the dancers costume guys im cryin rn :(
=
The 4 colored mics broke me...
=
At the end it feels like she's ready to finally throw her green mic and move forward.
=
I think Bom is in a place where she has been through so much, she is just happy singing on stage. She may be much older than the other teams, she's not able to put on such flashy performances and dances anymore like the others and she just has this distinct image that doesn't really allow her to put on a mask on stage (like acting sth out etc) but all of that makes her stages so much more emotional, real and authentic since she pretty much only sings. I actually never believed that she would win against all those groups since she has a huge disadvantage as a solo artist. But I'm still happy that she was given this opportunity to show her talent and rebuild her brand and connect with the other teams ♥♥
=
If Bom wants to go back, she's going back to be with the girls 
I don't think I'll watch this again without crying tbh
=
Imma throw hands if 2ne1 doesn't reunite on mama 2019
=
Starting from 3:40, the choreography that she did is from 2ne1 song "in the club" right??
=
That 4 mics!!! And thise 3 other girls dancing with her.
=
Bom is nominated in 3 categories for MAMA, please sign up voting every day, Bom needs us!! 
=
Bom did the same thing for the show as she did for 2ne1. She was a "beautifully unique transition." Which made this show special and made 2ne1 unique
=
My 2NE1 heart is crying so hard
=
The chorus singing “I want to go back” breaks my heart... YG really did 2NE1 dirty at the end...
=
She snatched wigs, stole hearts, and poured her emotions in our eyes. This was HER moment, BOM's moment.
=
When I saw all the mics all feels just came back and I felt like I was about to cry .. I know 2ne1 will not reunite here but all the feels ang memories that Bom was able give in show for 2ne1 girls and blackjacks is just priceless.
=
Not even a fan of 2ne1 but her love for the members made me stan 2ne1 and find out how a beautiful person Park Bom is.
As a fan of Mamamoo I'm happy that they won, but low-key I wanted Park Bom to win, the whole performance is full of emotions, professional and tells a beautiful story. 
I hope that she will have the recognition she deserves and even more
=
I started crying when I realized that the dancers were representing  Dara, CL and Minzy
=
This is so beautiful I’m speechless. It’s like a love letter to her members and to the fans
=
Omygaad. My heart 
=
YES THIS MADE ME BALL MY EYES OUTTTTTT.
=
We love you so much Park Bom! Thank you for standing strong despite of everything!
=
Her song to 2NE1 members 
=
Man this song is so powerful and heart breaking! I didn't have the subtitles on at 1st, but as soon as I saw the 4 mics w/ 3 dancers, I immediately understood. I had to start the whole video over to watch w/ the subtitles. This was amazing, I hope all of her 2NE1 members could see this too! 
=
And congratulations to all Mnet & Queendom people for this masterpiece of TV perfection <3
=
I want to see the other team's reaction.
=
she is amazing i miss her
=
I cried from the video message of Minzy till the end of the performance. I love 2ne1, always a Blackjack <3
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ PARK BOM U ARE PERFECT
=
As a fan of 2ne1 , I’m crying after I watched this performance ❤️
=
I'm crying so much!! I miss 2ne1 
=
im crying in front of my parents, they asking me why you crying in the morning while watching youtube ..
and when i show this to them, my mom say, the lyrics is too sad, it has meaning story cause the singer is almost crying ..
and i say, mom she was a part of girlgroup called 2ne1, one of the best girl group in south korea ..
after hearing that my mom say, did they have song that sound like that: bom ratatata tatata tata hey (while doin the dance choreo)
im laughing out loud and got goosebumps, i dunno that my mom know 2ne1, but she say her bias is Sandara, but no worries Park bom, she like you cause u're beautiful and has an amazing voice also
=
i got goosebumps watching this omigod
=
I think this was Park Bom's best stage on Queendom. Great way to end the show.
=
forever blackjack ❤❤
=
I cried 
=
I'm crying this is too beautiful
=
My tears cant heandle, even though your song at the beginning of the release number 6 for me you are still number 1 , your song a magic to take my heart and blackjack.Thanks for joining in Queendom #Imissyou2ne1
=
I cried so hard.  Way to go Bom!!!
=
She's like a Queen
=
Its really break my heart miss you 2ne1
=
Park Bom, you made me cry. I miss 2ne1 
=
I saw the mics and I was like... I MISS 2NE1 T.T
=
When they showed 2NE1's signature colored mics 
=
She is the queen 
=
QUEEN ✊
=
Those microphones.. 
=
Park Bom is a legend  her song is very dedicated 
=
Fantastic reallyyy!!!
=
We all wanna go back... 
I really need 2ne1 back. My tears won't stop. 
=
I started to cry alot ! 2ne1 was my first kpop girl group and bigbang  I listened too this two groups  and they will forever be my first favorite kpop artists whom got me into kpop and watching this whole performance and song it was very emotional to me and I bet many others whom listen to 2ne1 I respect every single one of them and I hope I see them once again even if its just one day for them to perform together that would be amazing ! But for now all i want for them is their good health and good future opportunities so I can be able see them often !
=
I’m crying
=
Bow down to THE QUEEN 
=
Proud of you 
=
The lyrics are so beautiful❤
=
Park Bom! 
=
Oh my.. I love you so much Park Bom
=
En mi corazón eres la ganadora ❤️
Mi corazón siempre estará contigo y 2ne1
=
When I was Cl & Minzy & Dara's mics, there was an waterfall in my eyes. I was really hoped other members will come... But, this was so emotional!
=
*I'm not crying you are*
=
We want 2ne1 back. The members want 2ne1 back. 
Why hasn't it happened yet?
=
Bom unnie!! we're here blackjacks hear you <3
=
She dont deserve the last place...she did so much....from all the other performances, it was the only one that i felt...honest...bom....for me you're the winner of this
=
I didn’t even stan 2ne1 but this made me cry so much
=
love bom !!!!! we love you !!!!! blackjack forever and ever
=
I miss 2ne1 
=
We are with you Bommie <3<3 ps:that mic drop in the end tho
=
Thank you for being a living proof that 2nd gen Kpop IS THE BEST ERA EVER!! Thank you Bom unnie for reminding me why I fell inlove with Kpop. It was definitely because of you 4 queens–2NE1 will forever be the queens and I don't care about the bashing I'll get by saying this but I stand by my claims. NO ONE WILL EVER COMPARE. And Park Bom will always be my #1 bias... I could still recall her cute bunny costume during Fire promo days.
=
YG needs to bring 2NE1 back if they want to rise up again
=
I LOVE THIS and it made me cry like hell. I only wish they made a way to not make her cover her face for the first half of the song. 
=
❤
=
MAEZINHA LINDA EU TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
=
I don’t know u guys but to me her song is the catchiest and when she sings, her voice really delivers the emotion and i never hear her hit the note that she hits in this song  i love it! Actually, all of her songs that she put out so far is good! The fans nowadays just voted not by the quality but by whose group that is currently famous at the time. I feel sorry for Park Bom but i gotta feeling that this is only the beginning of her new journey..this is good for her image and to let the younger generation know of her existence kinda almost..so, good luck Park Bom!  all the best! ❤️❤️❤️
=
I'm so happy and proud of her!! She is so brave and strong for coming back to music and breaking through. Keep shining Bommie!
=
✨✨
=
I'm still crying. It's the middle of the day and I'm crying like there's no stopping it. Bom is the Queen. No questions asked. The immeasurable amount of courage you would need to go do this. All by herself on stage exposing just how much she's hurting and missing her members, her best friends, her family, WHILE she's paving way for all the other girls in the industry, showing that you can go solo, you can have the body you do, you can be fiercer than ever in your thirties. That there's no stopping her. She's my role model. There I said it.
=
THE AMOUNT OF POWER THIS WOMAN HOLDS OH MY GOD.
=
Ngaun lang ulit ako nanuod ng mnet dahil dto kay bommy na performance
=
2NE1 forever
=
=
i miss 2ne1 so much, just know you're not alone bom, we're here for you
=
i feel so sad about Sulli, my sincere consolation to her fan. But as the one who following 2NE1, i feel so thankful that Bommie has been through the struggle and it’s wonderful now seeing her on the stage. Park Bom unnie, if you feel pressured, discouraged, hatred from K-netizen, pls remember that you are having fully support from international fan. Pls keep going with what you’re doing and we are still looking forward to 2NE1 reunion.
=
I feel like she was perform at mama 2019.. it's not a competition show
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
WHO ELSE SHED TEARS 
=
I swear, 2ne1 disbanding was the worst thing that happened to kpop, I literally stopped being a kpop stan when I heard the news about 2ne1's sudden and informal disbandment - there was just no closure at all for each of the members, and us Blackjacks always hope that they reunite one day, because they were all doing so great until it happened. I don't blame Minzy for not renewing her contract, and I'm certainly not blaming any 2ne1 members I just honestly thought YG could've handled the situation properly instead of debuting a new group (yes, Blackpink, I'm sorry for bringing them here) to cover YG's inability to properly take care of his artists. 

I miss 2ne1, and 2ne1 misses itself too - and it clearly shows. Park Bom's performance here has been the culmination of all that. We witness what she feels like from her perspective through her music. Whenever we listen to sad songs, we always CANNOT AVOID correlating it with her missing her group.

I've always been a silent person when it comes to the comment section, but seeing as this is the final performance and she dedicated this to her members as well as acknowledged the fact that she is now a SOLOIST, I'm just so happy that she took the leap of faith and the courage to start from scratch. It's not an easy thing to do, from being recognized as one of the best in the industry to going bacm from scratch where she has to make people pay attention to HER ALONE. I'm just so happy that she went back to music, and I'm so happy I came back to music because of her. She's my inspiration since 2008.
=
The dancer looks like dara, CL, and minzy when "crush" comeback 
=
okay I'm crying
=
We proub of youPark Bom
We 4ever blackjacks#2NE1
=
I was imagining the other three members would come and sing with her
=
she's not just singing... She's telling a story..
=
SHES JUST WANT WORLD SEE HER HOW HER BACK THEN , AND OPEN YOUR EYES WIDED
=
I miss the 2nd generation of k-pop so so much.
=
Feel her love, feel her pain, feel her soul voice <3
=
Queen ❤️❤️❤️
=
She miss 2ne1 
I’m miss 2ne1 và we miss 2ne1 Love unnie
=
I love this song! I miss 2NE1  I want to go back too!
=
I love Bom's performance! She miss her fellow members, and we miss them aswell! Love that pink hair or any pinkish color. You look so good
Bom, you are a legend. And I know you missed those memories...... Us too, we want the whole 2ne1 member.


CONGRATULATIONS IN ADVANCE, BOM, YOU WILL REMAIN LEGEND IN OUR HEARTS. WETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE, WE STILL WUV YOU!
=
I'm so happy park bom have a lot of song.. I really missed her voice
=

=
Your fans always will be here for you Bom please feel this 
=
This performance makes me very sad , it is clear that she did this for 2NE1, the lyrics of the song are dedicated to them and Bom misses, the moment, to be able to return again with them, Hopefully in the future we can see them again  all together ❤️
=
We love you park bom!!!
=

=
This make me cry so bad 
=
3:26 sHOOK
=
2ne1 forever  
=
I’m not blackjack,but I missing 2NE1.
Bom you are the best.
=
:')  
=
I have never been a fan of 2ne1 or Park Bom but I have to admit she got me this time
She really is amazing, her message and song was also very beautiful and emotional.
=
If Park Bom doesn't deserve a win, I don't know who does
=
2NE1 Please Come Back
=
Bommieee 
=
I WISH THAT 2NE1 WILL HAVE A CAMEO IF THIS SONG WILL HAVE A MUSIC VIDEO
=
I WISH THAT 2NE1 WILL HAVE A CAMEO IF THIS SONG WILL HAVE A MUSIC VIDEO
=
 imiss2ne1 
=
me: *is ready to cry during a Park Bom performance*
also me: *still cries harder than expected*
=
Wow this is emotional I cried when the other "memebers" came out and resembled minzy, CL and Dara
=
How can we get over 2ne1 if not even them can. I'm- 
I really hope they come back one day 
=
Gold, purple, and orange mic. I’m crying 
=
Nguwa ngeras lihat dara. Minzy ,Cl  pas mic  4 berderet
=
I still can't believe this won the last  place on Queendom... This whole performance is artistic and full of references. Respect to all 3rd gen groups but we all know the fact-nowdays it's all about looks,being skinny and dancing. 
Our Bommie deserved much better, but in the end she showed us that 2NE1 is still relevant. That's the chemistry some of your faves will never have. Be blessed
=
She really performed the high note live I am SHOOKTH
=
I “WANNA GO BACK” where 2NE1 still exist in the Kpop & International Music Industry
=
Aaaaaaaaa the goddess
=
when the dancers came out in the 'Crush' outfits in front of CL, Dara and Minzy's mics i lost it
=
Alguien noto los demás micrófonos con los colores de 2ne1  awww vuelvan plis
=
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. SHE ATE THE CDS. SHE LOOKS STUNNING. THE PRODUCTION IS TOP NOTCH. I LOVE IT
=
I love Park Bom
=
this performance is a visual and vocal delight with a very heavy feeling in the heart.
=
I cry so much because of this
=
yall surprise with her hitting that note ? She been nailing that in 2ne1 songs + epik high collab "Up", and her latest performance in immortal song also featured her hitting that note. Just queen being queen
=
I cant help but 
=
she is getting fat she is soooo cute
=
She does not need to win, we know what has happened to her over the years, she has returned to do what she loves most...TO SING for people!
=
WHY I'M CRYING 
=
I literally shed tears I'm a former blackjack but still support them poor bom and also glad she is doing good now and still hoping for minzy solo success 
=
Ahh watching this made me soo emotionaaall, I missssss theeemm huhu
=
I hope she has a comeback soon, im kind of in love with her music
=
I'm crying 
=
Bommie perf is all about missing 2ne1 and performing alongside them~
=

=
During this part of the wanna go back performance the clock strikes 13 times. If we go back 13 years ago that is the year Park Bom began her musical career (in 2006). This performance is filled with so many little references 
=
Miss you 2NE1 
=
Ahh the message of the song is for the comeback of 2NE1 ..
=
*524 people can choke in every bom's high note*
=
You are loved PARK BOM . Please know that ❤
=
Daaamn T.T 2ne1 where u all at .. comeback!!
=
She didnt deserve that last place with this legendary performance! She's a winner in my heart.
=
I'm criying 
=
We all wanna go back. :(
=
BOM 
=
Bom really misses 2ne1 from the red hair cant nobody era to her microphone that serves her symbol of being a 2ne1 member and the 3 back up dancers that symbolizes CL Minzy and Dara on Crush .. I MISS YOU 2NE1!!!!!!♠️
=
Love her.
=
I don’t want to cry but I just did.
=
I miss 2NE1 
=

I REALLY CRIED WHEN I SAW THE MIC OF 2NE1 HUHU. WE WANT 2NE1 BACK SERIOUSLY 
I'M SO PROUD OF BOM ♥️
=
2NE1!!
=
Well, that would win the show for me if I was in charge. All the groups did great, but Bom certainly is the standout, with a special voice and an iconic past. The performance was rife with messaging about what she has gone through, her past, present and future. Her singing is just absolutely wonderful and the meaning behind it all only elevates it to the next level. When she throws the mic at the end, it's a powerful statement, but bitter sweet moment. As the song says, she wishes and would give anything to go back to when 2NE1 were together, but she is starting to accept that they are not and she has a chance to continue alone, for now.
There are more technical singers in this contest, but every performance Bom has done has had weight to it, something I can't say I've seen from other groups separate of her. I'm certainly biased in that regard, but I really feel despite rankings, Bom is a true winner here. After, essentially, 5 years away from the scene, she has dropped new music, performed solo against a bunch of groups, formed some bonds with the younger singers and really recaptured a lot of that spectacle and confidence to perform, while challenging herself to sing songs she'd never sung.
Congratulations to Bom, the one from 2NE1 who had fallen farthest and been the most vulnerable, is the one that has come back swinging the hardest.
=
I badly want to go back to the time when 2ne1 was still a group,as a blackjack. Im crying so hard rn. I feel you bom,i feel the same way.... 2ne1 is the best
=
Things to note in this performance:
*Her red hair, homage to her 2NE1 days and their last MAMA stage
*Mic stands and color-customized 2NE1 mics
*The three dancers wearing the other three members' "Crush" outfits, which they wore in their last performance as a group
*The floor's design is 2NE1's Crush album art cover 
*The dance she did is the dance to 2NE1's In the Club
=
Only true blackjack can decode this performance.. Well done Bommie
=
Bom eu te amo demaaaais
=
Jusko yung mata ko.. Huhuhuhu
=
I didn't find one thing that makes Park Bom Not the winner !!
=
When she says that she wants to go back and she dances like in 2ne1... OMG, this performance is a masterpiece! It's not even about her voice itself, it is the meaning behind everything. She is a fighter! Love you, Bom, you are a legend!
=
now we got minzy  
2ne1 on mama2019 please!
and vote for bom!
=
Don’t mind me just crying in the corner ..
=
Tho park bom didn't win this, she will stay legendary and iconic. PERIODT!
=
when she elevated i cried she really wants to go back to their old memories as 2ne1
=
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
=
Go park bom go bom
=
her voice is just.... it's so unique and powerful, no one could EVER replace her. the emotions and everything that her voice carries, truly amazing and to me, she's already a legend and i am so proud of her❤️
=
The song itself are good but the messages are too deep.. she miss 2NE1 so much
=
this song has me crying i miss the time of 2ne1 together  and now it just Park Bom
=
Last time she wore that red was when she was stil 2ne1  I love how the dancers hair looked like the 2ne1 members 
=
This performance made me sob like a baby.  I just kinda wanna give her a hug, man
=
Love u bommiee
=
Park Bom deserves the world
=
We know that this song and this performance is to show that how much she miss 2ne1,she want to go back to their Era,when they were still together..
Oh my Blackjack heart
=
The microphones! THE MICROPHONES!!!!!!!!!!
=
I miss you 2ne1
=
I miss you 2NE1
=
She tried very hard. Support or Be quite, please.
=
This kind of song would never get bored even you hear this song for 10 years later.. right ?? Still curious who the girl tho.
=
I had goosebumps when they show the other 3 mics.. Bommie is trying to say that she's alone on stage without the other members right.  
=
"I still miss our last day together"  awhh I feel her ...
=
" Just one more time
Just for one day
I miss you too much
I wanna go back "
=
Im ugly crying. This whole competition Bom really knows how to move people. Its sad,  I wasnt even a hardcore stan but like its....sad. Its very raw. Her voice is very gifted.
=
The goddess who sings the songs with her all heart and soul
That’s the real talent that is hard to find in kpop (not only in kpop but also in world)
=
I died when that 4 mics appeared. Bring back 2NE1!!
=
Seeing her performing with 3 other girls breaks my heart.
Missin’ the good old days
=
Omg this breaks my heart. She is so talented.
=
She's amazing ❤
=
2:49 Hear the clock tick and think of 2NE1 <3
=
3:52 The Real Queen <3!!!
=
2NE1 FEEEELLLSSSSSSS 
=
Just got goosebump when i saw the mics
=
Awww this is so heartfelt. 
=
Let’s vote for Bom MAMA2019
She is showing she needs and misses 2NE1 members and us(blackjacks).So we need to show(tell) her that we love and support her.We need to let her know she is not alone
#Sorryformypoorenglish
=
i was shock when I see their mic omo huhhuhuhuhhuhuhuh
=
Enjoying every single second of it!!! B❤M
=
OMG!!! 
=
I wanna go back  You are killing my heart 
=
Hahaha i was wondering why they want a lip sync not the live voice of my dear Park Bom
It was so dissapointing 
Thats why world funs love Park Bom 
#2ne1
=
Omg her performance made me cry!! I miss 2ne1
=
I love her so much 
=
Excelente!!! Park Bom la mejor ❤️❤️❤️❤️ #2ne1forever ❤️❤️❤️
=
Beautiful performance !!! The Queen 
=
Im crying 
=
Alright. I’m high and now confused.
=
It reminds me of 2ne1
=
Love you, Park Bom
=
I miss 2NE1 so much :(( 
Kangen banget sama 2ne1 hadeuuhh tadi pas liat backing dancernya pake baju era COMEBACK HOME rasanya pengen teriaaaakkkkkkkkk!!!! 

COMEBACK 2NE1!!!!
=
OMG
=
 you did well Bommy!
=
_G O O S E B U M P S_
=
Parkbom I LOVE YOUUU!!!!! PH HERE
=
I m crying !!!!
=
Seriously, watching this performance makes my blood boil. You all can see how Bom really misses her members. 2NE1 did not deserve this. All of the members just seem so deprived of 2NE1 itself. If not only because of YG and the k-netizens, 2NE1 would still stand strong and we wont see our girls like this. This is truly heartbreaking.
=
Omg bom unnie slaying the final dance . So in love 
=
Queen 
=
Go go go go unnie !! 
=
OMG I noticed 2ne1 mix
=
It made me cry so much when I saw the 3 mic that represented the three members of 2ne1 miss them together so much I feel so sad
=
Bom did very very very well.
I miss 2NE1 soooooooo much.
=
I didn't notice the 4 microphones at first.
As I watching this performance again on the full episode and saw the 4 mics, I just started to cry like crazy.
=
Bom is too brave to compete solo in Queendom considering her opponents are groups and new generations of great girl groups. She's a true Queen indeed never afraid to compete. 
=
I cried when i saw the color of the mic 
=
I’m so thankful for what Queendom did to our beautiful lady.
=
Clear as day and sad as the night. 
=
She slayed even though her one in ear was out
=
The dance at the end just killed me. Also, I love how she represents each stages of her life and also 2NE1 ❤️❤️
=
We want 2NE1 on mama 2019 stage who is here to support? Please like
=
This stage is EPIC.   LEGENDARY.  
For those who are unfamiliar with the technical details of a live stage:  at 1:37, Bom Unnie starts having problems with her in-ear monitor.  This small earbud provides the music to the singer, so they can clearly hear what is happening on stage.  Please continue watching and notice Unnie's earpiece, which falls off completely at 1:53, just as the high note portion of the song begins, and the energy of the song is starting to build up.   This is the worst time to lose the audio feed.  
Still, Bom sings, emotes, owns the stages and doesn't show the audience the problem At this point, she cannot hear her backing audio clearly, and she is "singing blind".  At 2:50, Unnie has a break in the music and she discreetly tries to put her earpiece back in.  At 2:55, you can see her fumble desperatly with her earpiece, she cannot place it easily because her gorgeous nail art is in the way.  The high note is coming and she risks going out of pitch without her audio feed.  Also, at this point, she is already standing on the platform which will rise her up above the audience just as the song reaches its crescendo.  She doesn't want to miss the note and she is nervous for the finale that is coming. 
Even without her earpiece, she nails the high note at 3:26.  And the dance solo that follows - despite probably not being able to hear clearly.  This is the result of years of experience in front of an audience, and all the talent she has.  All hail the queen.  
TLDR:  Bom's earpiece fell out at 1:53, she delivers most of the stage without it, including the big high note.  EPIC.
=
The microphones were the colors of her 2NE1 sisters, my heart 
=
ok did   i just saw big bangs floaating lights?....ohhhh Bom i know we  missedd theem aand you guys too  T_T
So the othe Bom from the staaart is the old Bom.... T_T
=
The QUEEN IS BACK 
SCREAMIN* THOSES HIGHT NOTES FOR REAL 
BOM IS AN INSANE VOCAL!!!! 2NE1 WE WILL WAIT U
=
I got goosebumps the moment I saw those microphones 
=
" I WANNA GO BACK…" and with those 4-colored mics........YG take them back 2ne1 
=
I love Bom and I love 2NE1. This stage HURT. It was so damn good though. She gave a great performance and I love the song. It was very her. I'm glad she's had an outlet to actually be able to express some of the feelings she's had since 2NE1 disbanded.
=
I’m crying  
Bom we miss you guys too! 
So so much!
=
THATS A LEGENDARY VOICE GUYSES!
=
she try to put the thing back to her ear so hard.
=
Park bom de cabelo rosa ja e tudo pra mim
=
My tears suddenly burst out when I saw the four mics. I know what they mean. 
The red hair. Their looks.
Lyrics "You,  you,  you. I miss you so much."
Bom pointed at three different yousss. 
The shiny debut album cover, the "In the Club" moves... 
She poured all her heart in her singing. Can I not cry? 
WANNA GO BACK
=
I was wondering how other groups will react after seeing the 4 mics. I was touched.... Park Bom, keep on fighting!! You're awesome!!
=
I miss 2ne1 huhuhuhuhu.......
=
Ohhh llore  al ver los microfonos tan solo al imaginarme a 2NE1 junto otra vez   BOM hizo un gran trabajo  estoy orgullosa de Queen
=
I think Bom is the member of 2ne1 who miss the most being in the group :(
=
This stage was full of emotions 
She filled the stage with her presence, with her emotions 
Park Bom, you were great , you were awesome, amazing, beautiful 
Thank you
=
=
noooo the three other backup dancers :((((((
=
=
1:21
You You You is mean 2ne1
CL Minzy Dara 
It make me  cry TT
=
Thank you for being alive. Thank you Bom for not giving up. For killing the stupid knetz with your music. The bully knetz are killing kpop artist. Continue to spread your wings my queen!! Time will tell you gonna get back to time with the other members. 2NE1 #FOURever
=
Muchas bomshell mexicanas te esperamos y te amamos 
=
Same as: Paul, and if you add John, George and Ringo you get The Beatles, and that's too big, the best ever! <3
That's the message^^
=
" I’ll stay here 
Waiting for that day you come back 
Wanna go back "
=
They really don't let go of each other, we missed you all. We're so proud to you bommie luv u!
=
I swear I was doing fine until I saw the four mic stands, microphones in each of the members' colors, and outfits similar to the ones they wore during their Crush era. Makes me miss 2NE1 so much, but also makes me very proud of Bom for continuing to sing and make music.
=
The more I watch this, the more emotional I feel. And those lyrics...  Bommie, I love you!
=
The way I cried during the whole performance 
=
Preciosa eres la mejor
Tuve el mismo sentimiento que en los MAMA2015 ♥️
=
 my goodness! My heart is in a wreck! 
=
 This should have been ranked higher ❤
=
I'm crying (〒︿〒) ... I missed her so much,  her beauty and cute personality, her awesome voice, ALL HER ❤ ... And now she's here giving all for her and us... The Blackjacks & Bombshells we'll be for you
=
this shows that our queen can fight alone! how much more if we have full force 2ne1??  love u boommmieeee ❤️♥️
=
This is a beautiful song ❤
=
The mics mde me cried
=
my blackjack heart 
=
Wow, these goosebumps ❤️❤️ love you bommie, miss 2NE1 so much
=
When i saw the four mics, i cried. Hard. Bawling.
=
We still got no idea HOW GOOD Bom is <3
=
Park Bom bigger than the universe! <3
=
I'm crying so much. Bom, i miss 2NE1 too, a lot.
=
Park Bom is  the only winner of Queendom for me
The feelings of this song... The fact that she's talking about 2NE1... I'M CRYING
=
Omg when it shows 3 other member mics  miss 2ne1 as a group
=
Amo essa mulher❤❤
=
It's PERFORMANCE ART!! Park Bom is amazing as usual!
=
Almost 1 million, let's keep streaming blackjacks & bomshells <3
=
This voice.. ♥️
=
Ur not the first in queendom but My heart :)
=
A lenda extremamente aclamada
=
As soon as i seen 2ne1's mic i started to cry 
=
WE WANT YOU BACK ALSO
=
I miss them too, Bom... I feel you  I miss 2NE1 together  but support and love them all as solo artists  
=

=
I luv you my beautiful boooom we wanna go back 2 :(
=
Wow omg Bommie 
=
Rewatching this after mama2015 
Speechless
=
Best love lyrics ever
=
This is bom's screaming at as that she badly miss  2ne1, calling     her members and all the blackjack.. this performance hit us in another level..
=
Bommi! Never give up! Such an awesome performance! Please, be more confident!
=
Touch my heart always ❤️
=
What an amazing concept...I hope the other 2NE1 members see this and push to reunite someday
=
Red is definitely her colour ❤️❤️
=
Bom unnie ❤❤❤
=
Where can I order this, please?
=
Impecável! Merece TODOS os #1 dos charts! 
=
The references to 2ne1 songs, the stand in's for the other members in Crush era outfits, her In the club choreo, the red hair. If you can't feel how much was put into that performance then you're numb.
=
This song is beautiful!
=
With the trans... The song become surreal... Amazing!!!!
=
I cried with this song.
=
Omg!!! 2ne1 mic!!!
=
Siempre será la mejor 
=
Aşığım sana park bom
=
IDK why I feel so happy to see her there on stage. ❤.❤
#2ne1 #blackjacks
=
Perfect
=
Why this songs slapped tho??
=
Park Bom wins, no doubt, the best! <3
=
Bom needs to master the falsetto altho the tendency to easily hit high note has prompted her to use it less........her vocal still has so much potential. Take a few month leaves after queendom Bommie!!! I love the faletto high note more than anything else!!! LOVE YOU BOMMIE
=
i started crying when i saw the mics, bom wanna us know how  bad she want 2ne1 getting back together just like what blackjacks want too
=
4 mics that represents 2ne1 im crying ryt now
=
so sad……
=
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
When the dancers showed up, I thought they're actually 2ne1 members... hope is killing me right here:')
=
This performance made me so emotional. Bom has been through a lot in her life but in this show you can see how her confidence has been growing so much on and off stage. This final performance shows her full power as a vocalist and as a solo artist. She owns the stage even when she's all alone.
=
When i see the colour of mic i know it will be 2NE1 
Although its only dancer but i know there dress up look like Crush era in mama award. 
I really need 2NE1
=
The microphones I repeat 
THE MICROPHONES!!! 
I’m sobbing 
=
I'm crying so much, i really wanna go back i miss 2ne1 TTnTT
=
2in1!!!!!!!!
=
This performance has so much meaning. Bom and her voice is so magical. And I can't stop myself watching this performance.
=
were the 2ne1 girls' microphones?

I loved it, she always rocking in every way possible.
=
im not a devoted fan of 2ne1 but seeing this performance made me remember the days when 2ne1 was still active. they need a reunion
=
Omg!!!!! She hit her high note!!!! So much memories from this performance... Even though her earphone dropped she still rocked!!!
=
Bom did amazing  ❤️❤️❤️ I didn't like the others performance besides mamamoo, this is great, but does bom have a different fanbase? I wonder now that she is soloist
=
Bom's red hair, her green mic, the back up dancer's outfits. . . .  "mention of Goodbye". . . so much symbolism in this song. I wanna go back too Bom
=
LA AMO, NO PUEDO DEJAR DE ESCUCHAR ESTA CANCIÓN
=
she nailed it.........QUEEN
=
Seeing the Red, Gold, and Purple mic back on stage with BOM holding her Green Mic again.... *THE TEARS Y'ALL!!*
=
It is not her era. But she's still giving a good fight and doing her best despite of everything. And that's the most important. We always love you, Bom. You're great 
=
Really beautiful
=
I feel like all these fangirl things has just come back to me. And I realize that my youth Bommie is now 36 years old. Gotta Be You was 5 years ago. And here she is, gathers all her courage to be back again. Thank you Bom <3
=
This is what singing from the heart looks like
=
i wondered how can she didnt cry when she sang i can feel the emotions by the screen only.. 
DAREALQUEEN is COMING!!!!!
i've missed them so much
=
Lenda ❤❤❤❤
=
The moment I started to see those members mic, I'm crying 
Bom unnie song's telling us that she miss 2ne1 also us Blackjack, we truly miss them so much. Miss you Bom unnie, Dara unnie, Chaerin unnie and uri maknae Minzy  Fighting!
=
I really love her voice. 
=
AAAH I ATCUALLY THOUGHT 2NE1 CAME FOR A SECOND
I WAS ALREADY CRYIND SEEING THE 4 MICS SHE DIDNT HAVE TO GO THAT FAR
=
I started ugly crying when their mics appeared in the shot...2NE1 fourever <3
=
I felt her emotions!! Park Bom, we also miss 2NE1!! Thank you for such a heartfelt stage!
=
i dont even know how bom does it. its my first time hearing this song. yet her singing this make it seem like ive missed it soo much. and when i saw the remaining 3 mics i starting crying. its so sad to see how much she misses 2ne1. 
actually i was lowkey hoping that cl, minzy and dara would come on stage and grab those mics.
=
This song is so sad love you Bom unnie fighting!
=
Imagine if Dara, CL and Minzy performed with Bom 
=
the final stage looks like their AON album :c
=
The lyric....omaigad
=
Omg  im so speechless. All we ever wanted is a comeback ♥️♦️♠️♣️
=
Omg!!  bring 2ne1 back.

=
THE MICS!!!!!! AND COSTUMES!! CRUSH ERA. 2NE1!!!!!!
=
PARK BOM HAS THE VOCAL OF A LEGEND. I MEAN I WAS LITERALLY CRYING THE WHOLE TIME
=
she won that thing. change my mind.
=
The microphone kept falling out of her ear, especially in the end, but she continued anyway and slayed so hard! ❤️
=
Bom delivered such a beautiful performance! Idk about anyone else but I feel like her voice had definitely improved over this show and her vocals for this were incredible! Great visuals, loved the 2NE1 member tribute and the ending was perfection!
=
♥️♥️♥️
=
the crush concept outfit of the back up dancer, the 4 mic ! its all about her group! i bawled! i dont care weer she win or bot! after what she been through , she’s bow back on stage that made her a winner a already
=
I honestly cried my eyes out seeing minzy's   short video message and was kinda hoping 2ne1 would do a surprise performance as OT4. Us blackjacks will continue to wait for that day!! ❤
=
Indonesia 
Kenapa hati aku hancur melihat park bom menyanyikan lagu ini,,,karna aku fan di jaman mereka dulu
=
I was already emotional when she started but as soon as I saw the gold mic I was a goner. Oh man....
=
*Seeing the legendary mics of 2NE1 makes me WANNA GO BACK in time so much. I miss those times where they can be happy as four. I want 2NE1 back.*
=
I’m crying so much right now Bommie we love you
=

NO I cannot hold it
=
Makahilak man sab ta ani. 
=
cuando he visto los microfonos...uff que llorera
=
For 2ne1 
=
Is it just me, or like during the other times when Bommie is watching the other girl groups in her resting/waiting room she always looks a little sad or longing about the old days when 2NE1 would perform and do this kind of things together, but now no moreee :''''''''''''''''(
=
I cried, in a specific moment, when bom unnie goes to the center of the stage and pops up the microphones each with the color of the members of the 2ne1 , I did not hold on i cried a lot , I still miss the 2ne1 .. all blackjack feels.. 2ne1we love you , no matter if gave disband we will always love you under all circumstances , we love you Good , Dara , CL , Minzy 2ne1<3

This is a really meaningful. I really can feel the pain. Im crying so hard. Oh Bom we love you so much❤
=
It's fine... Let's walk on the flower path at another way... Let's find it together ❤
=
This is art, my queen!
=
I’m so proud of bom. Such a sweet baby. I’m happy how much she has done on her own and how hard she has been doing a soloist. Also, I’m so sad to see that she had dancers who were made to look like the other members. Breaks my heart  blackjack forever!!!!
=
The 2NE1 tribute 
=
THIS IS THE TALENT OF MY PARK BOM!
=
when the three girls appeared, i literally cried.  it reminded me of the times  before 2ne1 disbanded. Bom's voice and expression really showed that she missed those days.
=
you know why park bom never become 1 place ? 1 of the reasons mnet surely is trash over real talent. 2 she is solo compare to other they perform as a group and has a huge fanclub. but after all. win is win and lost is lost.
=
I LOST IT WHEN I SAW THAT THERE IS 4 MIC STANDS!!!!!!!
=
I cry, when i see 4 mic
Minzy Dara CL Bom 
=
You did so well, Eonnie!! I really hope four of you will be able to reunite 
=
Dude this is hella good!!!! I know this means so much for 2ne1 members and the fans. Thank you Park Bom!!
=
Yaaassss the red hair and the legendary mic!!!
=
i wanna go back too. when yg is a family :( 2ne1, seungri, bi, nam taehyun :(
=
You are still the queen, Bommie! 
=
O I miss those legendary mic hope to see the owner (2ne1 member) performing as a group again
=
Those mic's 
=

=
I don't know what I love the most about this performance. The iconic red hair, Bom's vocals, THE SONG ITSELF, the overall concept of this performance, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT. except for Bom's damn ear piece. HAHAHA.
=
She is miss her sisters (2ne1) . . I wish will reunion  soon 
=
my dear BOM you really the elderly sister of 2NE1, you fight with 2ne1 I really hope that can see 4girls performance again in the future
=
when 3 mics were standing there and empty... I started crying... I miss 2ne1...
=

=

Park Bom did legendary perf every week.  this show unite all the group. A very rare interactions that can only be seen in end year award. I love to see their friendship. Ranking doesnt matters.fighting! *feeling nostalgic with the mic colors and when she drop the mic. CL and Taeyang also did that before. TT

=

=
This is definitely her best performance, I'm crying so hard, i feel like she finally found herself here❤❤ she is a queen
=
she'll always be one of the four queens
=
Omg the 2NE1 references in this performance had me shook :(
=
omg 4 mic belongs to 2NE1
=
look who is crying right now?

=
Is there anyone think the last pose is similar to the finishing pose of BEST “OMG”?
=
THE IN THE CLUB CHOREO AT THE END WITH THE OH OH BACKGROUND VOICE IM OMFG STOP PMG 
=
i've been crying a lot when i watch this performance . its because , i have been supporting 2NE1 since their debut . seeing how much they've struggled just to be on top , going through hard time , harsh words and even worse , their company doesn't treat them right is like a hard life but they still manage to stand and show us that they can do it . when i watch this performance , i cant hold my tears cause i can feel how lonely Bom is and i hope people will keep supporting her and a solo artist and support the other member too <3
=
We need a 2ne1 stage on MAMA 2019.
=
WHEN SHE HIT THOSE HIGH NOTES.  I WAS LIKE GET IT GURL!!!!!

=
The meaning of this stage concept was so deep :( when the 3 dancers as CL minzy and dara ? OMG. I can feel what she felt right there!! Bom was struggling too much. She is one of a wonder woman *applause*
=
I still hate the fact that YG destroyed 2NE1. I'm crying rn.. You can see how much Bom missed being with 2NE1
=
I got goosebumps when she pitches her high note. I was like "YASSSSSSSSSS BOMMM YASSSSS!!!!!!!"
=
I'll be here
Till the day you come back
I'll be waiting for you
-Park Bom, waiting for her girls to come back.
=
I cried so hard while watching this performance. Once a Blackjack will forever remain as a Blackjack, I guess :)
=
IM SO EMOTIONAL WHILE WATCHING THIS TO THE POINT THAT I NEEDED TO EAT A CHOCOLATE TO BE HAPPY AND SMILE
=
In terms of performance, this is the least fancy, but the song is the catchiest.
=
The moment I saw the gold, purple mic. My heart goes like Park Bom's high note really got me goosebumps. 2NE1 FOUREVER❤❤
=
This really makes me cry and sad. 
=
when I saw the dancers it reminds me CL, DARA and MINZY and I burst to cry it reminds me 2ne1 :'(
=
the most emotional performance for me. i cried
=
I MISS MY QUEENS THE LEGENDARY 2NE1! COME BACK PLEASE
=
I know how much bom misses my noona’s! HOPE 2NE1 Will definitely have a comeback. Blackjacks is feeling me rn 
=
Listening to the full album and I love her song the most, the feeling and the voice tho, still a legendary queen 
Eventho I must admit she is not as strong as before, her pronouncation is kinda off.... so fighting!!
=
Ohmygod the coloured mic is 2ne1 i haven't forgot that, i miss them❤
=
Bom unnie! I cried when the 3 other girls came out with iconic 2ne1 royal-like outfit. the lyrics, the story, it fits perfectly. im crying rn. wishing 2ne1 to reunite and come back. i love you bom. fighting

OMG the mic 
=
for a sec, i tot 2ne1 was on stage...T.T
=
I truly missed the times when CL, Dara, Minzy and Bom performed together. The last time that they actually show people how powerful they are is during MAMA
=
I reallly like her voice...so unique
=
I love you Bom.
=
There's just something about Bom's style that makes her songs very sentimental. This stage was so personal to her too.
=
You don't need to win. You don't need trophy. You don't need any competition to prove you are a queen bcos you already proved it since then. You already won without any battle bcos you keep fighting until now. You are powerful as an artists and you've showed a lot. You are at your best, and those best will never fade in people's heart. Thank you for being our BOM ❤
=
OH MY GOD WHEN I SAW THOSE MICS LINED UP I INSTANTLY CRIED 
=
I'm crying..... who's cry with me.. click vote..
=
Aren't y'all proud of our Bommie? She's so precious, she must missed those 3 amazing woman she used to perform with :(
=
To happen to put an artist as talented and creative and so filled with emotions in a show like this is such an amazing experience!! Park Bom was always the sweet soul in 2ne1 knowing that it a girl crush powerful girl group but she always succeeded in making it all fade and create the ballance we all fell for with her magical angelic vocals!

I'm so glad she's got to show how emtional she is! how talented she is! and how ready and preapred she is to give it all when it comes to things she loves and appreciates starting with her most beloved group 2ne1!!
I couldn't help but cry and smile at the same time watching this cuz I know as a 2nd gen Kpop fan how is it for all of us, how do we feel.. cuz Kpop is not like any other Music industry.. we get hurt and miss our faves so much!! it sometimes lead to depression and extreme sadness because as we grew up, we were always casted out and only KPOP made us feel there's something fun and colorful and amazing to live up to and feel happy and enjoy!!

I'm so happy she's doing her best to relive all of that and can't help but be happy for her and support her from the bottom of my heart cuz she deserves that!! she really does!!

PARK BOM IS A LEGEND!!
=
2NE1
=
NAO AGUENTO MAIS SOFRER CARALHOOOOO EU TE AMO DEMAIS 21FOREVER 
=
I wasn't a Park Bom fan before Queendom started, but I'm definitely one now! That was a fabulous performance! Love the song!
=
I want her to be with her members again, she's so sad T_T
=
She dedicated that song for cl,dara,minzy and blackjacks fans.. 
I Miss them so much im still hoping were back as a 4 member 
Goodjob bommie saranghaeo 
=
=
=
Tell me I am not the only one crying while watching her performance.
=
This song is for 2ne1 banwagon and also to her co-members gosh miss niya na talaga ang 2ne1 
=
