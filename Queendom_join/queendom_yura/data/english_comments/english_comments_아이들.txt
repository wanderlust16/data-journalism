คนไทย❤
=
Who else agrees Minnie should do this intro on one of the award shows it would leave everyone shook
=
Producer: so how many versions do u want of  latata?

(G)-idle: yes
=
The number of Thai people not realizing Minnie is Thai until now......lol
=
ไหนคนไทยที่มาดู "มินนี่" ส่งไลค์หน่อยเร็ว!!!
=
too bad this is the only performance they got 1st place, like all of their performances should place 1st, so i stan talent not just winning, GO Idle
=
I've replayed this so many times for Minnie's Thai intro
=
คนไทยทางนี้มีใครดูไหม~♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
Don’t be fooled by Minnie , she’s a sorcerer in here but in her Instagram dean cover , she’s an absolute angel. DUALITY AT ITS FINEST
=
And a lot of people thought Queendom was a bad idea . This performance definitely isn't 
=
I'm Thai person. Minnie's part it feels like a Thai ghost movie.
=
Minnie will collab with Wengie on a song named "EMPIRE." M/V and the song will be released on october 18th! Please show a lot of love for the song!
=
Both Latata and Fire cover on Queendom are now 10m, only Gidle could pull that
=
Minnie’s part after Soojin always kills
=
(G)I-DLE's journey on Queendom was honestly incredible! They did nothing but deliever high quality performances every single time they stepped on this stage. I'm really proud of them!
=
im not a fan but this whole remix totally kill me, im shook man. pure talent Soyeon

and Gfriend Yuju sure dead watching this lol
=
Minnie's vocals is really something 
=
honestly the fact that both of their queendom performances have received 10+ million views. Gidle leaders of the 4th gen for real!!
=
Soojin she always caught the  camera fixing her hair 
=
they should do this kind of concept if they perform MAMA next year
=
U know what this is g idle. The iconic intro is so lit ..minnie u are the best..
=
G idle definitely has the potential to be as successful as BTS! only if they get the right support from their company, cube ent.
=
Minnie speaking thai in the beginning is LEGENDARY
=
Minnie's intro straight up gives me Thai horror movie flashbacks, scaaary
=
Its incredible how they performed Latata a lot of times but you never will get tired listening to it, Its just Amazing! 
Neverlands, we are in the correct Fandom >:'3/
=
Damn it’s not a good idea listening to the intro while reading the subs, dark at night
=
Soojin's "Who's Scared?" me bish, I'm scared. You girls are too powerful!
=
People got scared when our soojin asked “ who is scared “
=
Minnie: calling demons 
Soyeon: give me your soul
=
14/12/2019 
Still cant move on from this
=
their queendom perfomances are all high quality and not your typical stage..they set the standard..
=
ใครคนไทย
.    มินนี่
=
Nevies stream their koyote "sad dream" performance in immortal songs, one of the proof gidle can slay any concepts. :) koyote is also their fan. Gidle collecting legends, seniors that loved them.
=
Honestly I love this concept more than the original ..
=
We should be praising Queendom for giving us all these amazing performances that drives us insane
=
And all of this incredibly good shit is coming from Jeon Soyeon's incredible brain.. she's a prodigy❤❤❤
=
They look so healthy. 
They are not a morbidly underweight gg.
=
I wish they had released a studio version of this version.
=
soyeon is a greattt leaderrrrr
=
1:27 awwwww
=
Everyday everynight latata” the audience frozen  me too ✋
=
Imagine this On MAMA stage 2019 crazy
=
They performed latata for millions times but each performance is different 
Soyeon is so creative
=
One of the most iconic intros in the history of kpop 
=
It's not soyeon's fault that she's extra talanted & attractive
=
The world need to know about gidle!!THEY ARE THE BEST IN THIS GENERATION! COME ON GUYS THE TALENT, THE VISUAL, THE MUSIC, THE QUALITY OF THE GROUP DESERVE THE WORLD!JUST ACCEPT IT GUYS.
=
ใครไทยบ้างไลน์​หน่อย
⤵️
=
02:46 I'M LAUGHING SO MUCH AT THIS.
=
This group totally freeze the moment
They're absolutely dangerous!
=
As the winner of 1st round, GIdle got to choose which contestant they want to cover on the next round n they picked Park Bom cuz they want to cover 2NE1's song..
=
soyeon: *breathes*
me: 2:45
=
Minnie and Soyeon are so stable omgggggggggg
=
soyeon is a genius
=
It is true that I was under spell of Minnie. I've been obsessing (G)idle since then. I'm trying to find a way to break the spell but somehow I end up here 
=
When LATATA first came out, my friend said Minnie gave him scary stage presence and now there’s this and I see why 
=
Every perfomance is the most v**es in queendom
=
So happy to see so many korean and thai comments (even tho I can't read them). 
=
Ok, but Minnie’s intro will be the most iconic thing in kpop
Am I right, she’s a vampire
=
At first my bias was soyeon bcoz of her stage presence but now I'm more into Minnie  her voice pull me toward her and also she's so cute with bang.
=
小娟真的是不可多得的人才
很高興舒華跟雨琦有這樣的隊長
讓她們發光發熱 加油
=
Aaaaaaannnnnd this was the performance that forced everyone to kick their performance up another notch. To me, at least. Everyone's probably thinking at this stage that they cannot let the maknae show them up. 
=
Minnie X Soojin siren twins' visual really captured my eyes.
=
They're born to perform 
=
Honestly Latata is one of those songs that will be legendary forever. It's amazing and I always get goosebumps
=
Thailand is very famous with horror movies and Minnie's makeup looks like Princess Ahmanet in the movie The Mummy. I LITERALLY GOT CHILLS 
=
SEEING THIS PERFORMANCE MADE ME A NEVERLAND. I LOVE YOU ALL, MY QUEENS 
=
I'm thinking if I should stan these girls
=
Someone recommended me this and I will regret it. Such a mesmerizing performance. I have never seen a play like this.
=
Soyeon coming back to Mnet as Scary Unnies with her sisters :)
=
every moment when soyeon appear at the center make me feel excited!!!she always  make the audience cheers
=
I've watched this many times already but I still get goosebumps all the time 
=
Deadass though, soojin and miyeon can kick me in the face and I’d be blessed for life
=
this is insane, I REALLY LIKE IT!!!
=
Soyeon would make a great executive producer of a record label in the future.
=
GET THIS TO 10M NOW..
=
ชอบอ่าาา มินนี่เอาความเป็นไทยมาโชว์ด้วยน่ารักมาก หลงนางเลย
=
I love Minnie's expression. I mean its so dark even her voice! Man she's so scary.
=
00:43 "JAK MAKITA" ILOCANOS CAN RELATE TO THIS HAHAHAHAHAHA
=
Gotta love that G-IDLE always puts a unique twist on every live performance of their songs.
=
Im excited to their "say no/ put it straight" performance in queendom. I think next next  thursday it will air :)
=
Minnie using her mother tongue for the intro......SLAAAAAYY!!
(edit) YO THANK YOU FOR THE LIKES...it's just so....RARE
=
I just love how (G)-idle gave everybody a run for they money since the beginning they didn’t come to play with nobody .
=
what soyeon can't do....she is gold
=
2:46 I died at that guy’s expression 
=
Love minnie in the opening !
=
How many versions of Latata do u want?
Soyeon:yEs
=
is it just me or did i see yoon junghwan and kim sihun in the audience?
=
minnie is truly thailand princess! bringing her language to a perfomance that is broadcasted in a different country, just wow. im so proud of them! and im so happy that they won!
edit correction: proud
=
Shuhua’s voice sounds so confident I love it :)
=
I've only seen two performances from this group. I'm liking this Soyeon girl. Heard she's the leader. It actually shows by how she carries the group. I like her.
=
Rewatching this for the nth time and the feeling is the same 
=
Its october and I have watched it for a 1000 times and ik that I won't be over it no matter how many years pass by
=
1:43  that part got me shook
=
Was watching Mamamoo on Queendom, then saw this performance ..  now i keep comming back to watch this amazing performance ^.^  love it so much.
=
*Alert Mnet this the reason you need bring them on MAMA this year and give them special stage*
=
The intro  Amazing
=
10M!!!
=
Glad so many Korean comments. Hope more Korean Neverland！！！People around world love GIdle！ ♥️❤️
=
0:40 these guys look like they're from a school trip
=
At the end everyone was entranced with the song and stage, singing along to the last chorus.
=
YEAH YOU ARE K-POP.
=
Almost 2 months have passed yet this performance still haunts me! I love it! 
=
Jeon Soyeon my ULTIMATE BIAS WRECKER.
=
Before this i only stan Soyeon, but thanks to Queendom NOW I STAN ALL OF EM 
=
2:03Yooa❤❤❤
=
OMG SIHUN IS THERE WITH THE OTHER CONTESTANTS OF PRODUCE X 101
=
I got goosebumps by that Minnie thai intro every time,
They nailed this sorcerer theme that got them to the #1 place.
=
ugh i just love soyeon, she shinessss
=
Wow... This version's more vi3ws than debut stage Latata on MCD, in the short time.
=
Guyss check out their lion mv!!
=
As expected from soyeon, the genius leader
=
this and Say no are absolutely crazy performances, I got goosebumps watching and hearing both. wow! The arrangement and the choreography and all the added details...
=
2:48  his face
=

=
Attention neverlands Cube Ent confirms collaboration between Minnie of gidle and popular Australian influencer & YouTuber called wengie .The single ‘EMPIRE’ will be released Friday October 18th at 4pm KST.
=
Woooaahhh this performance is perfect for the Halloween season. Its so mysterious and all.
=
Wow is an understatement. This is absolutely a masterpiece! ❤️
=
(G)i-dle jst killed it ....keeep it up
=
Y'all!!!! Check out (G)I-DLE's performance on Immortal Songs. You'll be amazed even more of their live vocals!!!!
=
The only right decision cube made was letting them debut
=
This was the performance that made me fall in love with them ❤️❤️❤️
=
You know latata’s spell worked bc towards the end , all of them are singing along as if they were enchanted
=
On every qeendom performance they had, 
Everyone : please perform like this in year end awards
Guys, chillllll LOL
They might shook you with new performance
=
Soyeon is a genius!
=
Soojin killed me and i'm happy 
3:42
=
Keep repeating the intro
=
I think I'm in love with the fanboy at 1:27
=
I keep on coming bck here watching their performance. A side tht, do u guys notice at 1.28 cute guy? Heeee
=

=

ANYWAYS LOVE THE PERFORMANCE THEY ALWAYS TO THEIR BEST AND THEY NEVER FAIL TO LOOK GREAT~
=
To think again.... This is their DEBUT song.... 
=
Move give way, (G)I-DLE is on the way!
=
Ok...ok I loved this performance they changed this song into something completely different they tricked us and the crowd with this performance we all expected that drop but nope
=
Eyy Guys....am i the only one thinking WHY G-IDLE'S FANBOYS ARE FREAKING HANDSOME!!!!
=
i can't stop coming back to rewatch this performance 
=
คนไทยยยยย❤️
=
This could be their performance for the award shows
=
1:27 fan boyyy❤️
=
I like this group for there like a mixed 2ne1 and gg
=
That’s a freaky intro! 
=
Their stages are so cool I should watch them more often
=
Minnie is a Goddess isn’t she I mean a person can’t be this perfect !!
=
*this is what i call art*
=
3:22 who is she?
=
I swear! I’ve been a fan of Thai drama and music wayyyyyyyy before Kpop was even huge. Thai is such a beautiful language. 
Idk what she saying but she can call me a hoe and bitch and I still think it sounds beautiful lol
=
O M G 
=
Still this my fav..
=
i thought minnie was summoning a demon but i read the korean subs and it looks pretty normal

=

=
They just confirmed this is not a fandom anymore but a cult
=
SOYEON❤

=
I’m sorry but his face at 2:46 has me dying 
=
1:27 หล่อนะๆ
=
THE INTRO AND DANCE BREAK WERE BOTH SO GOOD OMG I'M SO PROUD OF THEM...LEGENDS!
=
g(idle) out here starting a cult
=
3:22 wtf even is that thing
=
Minnie's Thai Intro:
ค่ำคืนนี้ คุณจะตกหลุมรัก
Tonight, you will fall in love

ถึงมันจะอันตราย แต่คุณจะลุ่มหลงไปกับมัน
It may be dangerous, but you will be addicted to it

หากเป็นเช่นนั้น คุณจะไม่มีวันถอนตัวออกมาได้
If so, you will never be able to escape

แต่เชื่อเถอะว่ามันจะเป็นค่ำคืนที่ดีที่สุด
But believe me, it will become the most beautiful moment of your life

(and then comes the creepy part)
จงรักฉัน จงมีแค่ฉัน
Love me, only me

จงมองแค่ฉัน
Look only at me

จงฟังแค่ฉัน 
Listen only to me

And she keeps repeating these lines. Minnie says these lines in kinda forceful way like she's casting a spell. Hope this help!
=
Minnie's voice at the start gave me chills. Thai sounds beautiful. Especially when she whispers "LATATA". The girls killed this performance, too. Soyeon's part left me speechless. I love ya (G)I-DLE ❤
=
Someday they will be so big and they will have so many wins in music show you know why bc they are talented
=
@1:27 The best Lata!
=
i came here to watch sihun crumbs AHHHH my baby at 3:10
=
Gosh all the fanboys were so cute 
=
My fav intro it gives me goosebumps everytime Im watching it
=
00:18 / I never knew G-IDLE have a really cute fanboy like this guys...
Excuse me
=
ชอบมินนี่~~~~
=
I don't stan them but damn these girls know how to preform
=
The guys on their audience look so good damn

=
All the audience reaction is my reaction
=
Thailanddd❤️❤️
=
I see Kim Sihoon :)) my pick
=
I'm Thai and never thought that our language would sound this creep and horror. Minnie is daebak.
=
This performance made me fall so deep in love with them
=
Soyeon can do everything except eat vegetables
=
Goosebumps!
=
WATCH THEM FLEX THEIR LIVE VOCALS IN IMMORTAL SONGS.. JUST SEARCH ON YOUTUBE....
=
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS
=
I miss soyeon's long hair

=
ชอบที่ใช้ภาษาไทยเปิดคือแบบขนลุกมากรักๆ❤❤❤
=
This is amazing I really loved it
=
Minnie made me feel blessed for being Thai and understanding all of it
=
that dude who went from 1:26 to 2:45 kills me every time lol
=
This is still my favorite performance out of all (G)I-DLE's performances in Queendom. Fire and Say No were kinda lacking for me. They should've changed Fire and Say No's arrangement too (I mean the instrumental.)
=
0:39 Latata
=
Happy Birthday Minnie ❤️#DreamyMinnieDay
=
there is no doubt idle truly are performers this was amazing i’m endlessly proud

很有宗教感開場很讚   但歌的部分沒有很什麼改變    照原本的唱感覺有點浪費的舞蹈跟背景整體風格   感覺就不足了什麼
=
ชอบน้องจากคลิปนี้เลยฮือออออ หลงงงงง
=
2:46

=
คนไทยหรอ
=
is it produce x 101 trainees reunion or smth?
=
Soyeon is such a queen. She doesn't need to lipsync because her rap is on point always.
=
Not a gidle fan. But that was one hella lagendary intro
=
Don't be lazy, mnet is crazy!
=
Can't understand a single comment but I bet they said this was amazing
=
The fact that Pdx101 trainees has a lot more screentime here than in produce ahhahahah
=
I'm here for (G)I-DLE but the fanboys killing me
=
Can someone send this to taehyung, HE’S GONNA LOVE THISSSS
=
When jealousy strikes you the only thing you want to do is throw hate on that person. So haters, grow up and matured. Too much jealousy can kill you. Its not gidle's fault if they are monster in stage or they are getting attention now. Workhard and keep supporting your faves than stalking idle and throw hate on them.
=
จงรักฉัน จงมีแค่ฉัน จงมองแค่ฉัน จงฟังแค่ฉัน ๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆ
=
1:56 i'm obsessed with this

Why does everyone in the crowd look like idols 
=
"who's scared?"
ME
Edit: this is the most likes I've ever got. Thank you ❤️
=
i am a proud neverland since day 1!!
=
(G) I-DLE) for me it is the best group of kpop girls of the moment of this new generation :)
=
after 2ne1, MMoo and Gi-Idle are the groups i love watchig because their stages are never boring. plus I like that they arent stick thin unlike gg's these days.
=
Cube can you please release studio version of this? We are still begging you.
=
10M LET'S GO NEVERLAND
=
I see a lot of korean's commenting. Thank you for noticing this girls
=
Minnie at the beginning ❤️❤️
=
The leader of this group is good, she’s the blond girl right?
=

=
Do you know instagram a guy at 1:27?
=
Wow 3:42 Soojin
=
Soyeon should make her own agency and produce groups like G idle when she graduates. This girl is just too genius to stay as a kpop star
=
This is epic enough for MAMA end of the year performance BDJSISIAJS monster rookies 
=
minnie summoned a slaying demon to slay them viewer
=
What's the best decision you have ever made ? 
Being a (G)I-dle stan
=
Minnie cast the LOVE SPELL
"This night, you will fall in love..
Although it is dangerous, but you will be enamoured with it..
If so, you will never be able to quit (loving me)...
But believe me, it will be the best night you ever had..."
"Love me, have only me, look only at me,listen only to me x2 " (0.28-0.29 This is a kind of a black magic of ancient Thai  love spell)
=
Gidle really gonna be a big thing in kpop. They produce their own songs and their live performance also good
=
มีภาษาไทยด้วยย
=
I go back too watching this too tell people how fcking talented these queens are.
=
Because of this I because a (g)i-dle fan and my bias is soyeon and minnie
=
I hope the cover this on kcon Thailand tomorrow
=
(G) I-DLE is on KCON Thailand. Hoping they would perform this in front of Thai crowd 
=
this is the nth time that i'm watching this performance and minnie's intro still gives me goosebumps
=
Soyeon killing me, 
(G)I-DLE survive me
Again

Not to be rude or anything but I think this group has more talent than blackpink and deserves to be known to the whole k-pop industry
=
You know why i stan idle? 
I've watched this performance everyday and I'm still watching it without getting bored. 
That's the stage presence.. Not everyone can relate ‍♀️

=
Unsurny spt berbau mistis :v
=
Soyeon is the people behind this concept and chose the legendary part Minnie's. And teach the right minnie's tone, finally people like minnie's part
=
We are excited on your US Debut girls.  i know america will going to love you all.
=
Gidle is just pressure in performing fire, but regardless they did amazing cover of that song and they are still trending until now at some countries. But when it comes to their own songs they can beautify it more with their remixes and changing the choreos :) still this is their best performance in queendom so far.
=
ค่ำคืนนี้ คุณจะตกหลุมรัก
ถึงมันจะอันตราย แต่คุณจะลุ่มหลงไปกับมัน
หากเป็นเช่นนั้น คุณจะไม่มีวันถอนตัวออกมาได้
แต่เชื่อเถอะว่ามันจะเป็นค่ำคืนที่ดีที่สุด
จงรักฉัน จงมีแค่ฉัน จงมองแค่ฉัน จงฟังแค่ฉัน
จงรักฉัน จงมีแค่ฉัน จงมองแค่ฉัน จงฟังแค่ฉัน

=
It's crazy how one can never get sick of this song. Its so freaking addictive. And now a remix?!?! The front got me so shocked, it's so freaking amazing. Like I was under some kind of spell. Soojin looks amazing T.T
=
Remember that they're still a rookie group compared with other contestant.
=
Gidle will be deputing in the USA on their next comeback omg they signed with a famouse American label.  The girls are going world wide.

=
Dayum this whole time I’ve been thinking well it’s nice and Soyeon likes to grab attention but this one is not really for me. It’s nice but it’s not my favorite and it feels a little static.
But the end. Ohhh the end. Wow. So it was probably on purpose to shock you through all the performance and to blow up in memorable moments in the end. It was really good
=
ฟังครั้งแรกเหมือนโดนสะกดจิตอะขนลุกเลย~

=
*SOYEON* is such a girl crush she’s this talented.
edit: I get it!! some of y’all don’t like her because she’s stealing all your hombres!!!!! PERIOD!!!!!!
=
they have already performed this song for how many times already and soyeon still squeezes out something new for this song. it never gets boring. i swear she's so creative
=
oh my god soyeon
=
Soyeon is one of the best leader ever in kpop
=
The fact the original singer of this song was so satisfied with this performance but sadly it only got No.6
=
Park Bom : *I wanna show this to Dara*
Me : *Crying* 
=
I'm a girl but Soojin is it? She's freaking seductive
=
I'm sure Soyeon can 180 degrees change this song, but she chose not to. Bcs she still want to use the original color of this song as a tribute to 2ne1. Proud of them!!!
=
I love miyeon's voice I feel like her voice suited this song.
=
miyeon must have practiced this before when she was in yg
=
6th place for this. What  a joke. Can't mnet hear the crowd
=
"i wish i had her talent."
*lick lips*
=
Miyeon didn’t debut with Blackpink but she performed Fire before them lol
=
Soyeon looks like she's having so much fun
=
Why is that happy dad in the audience actually me??
=
The way she licks her lips at 4:02 fangirling over soojin had me dead .
=
Shuhua: *breathes*
Me: 
Shuhua: *Gets lines*
Me: *Literally dies*
=
"I wish I had her talent"
I FEEL YOU, GIRL
=
They ain't playin' when they said they're the best in this generation.
=
Soojin is so shy in person, but on stage damn man
=
I love how yuqi somehow took inspiration from Dara’s crazy hairstyles:(((
=
why does Soyeon sounds like CL? Goooosh she's the long lost daughter, owemji.
=
Guys gidle did not want to change the original that much . They were kind paying tribute to their seniors.  Wait for their next performance or comeback song it going to be epic
=
that's the number of girls who turned lesbian after seeing soojin at this stage
 |
\/
=
Can we appreciate hwasa being fangirl over this song aaa such a cutie
=
Shuhua is like a real life princess fantasy chinese movies. Beautiful
=
When Soyeon said they're the best in this generation, you gotta believe her
=
the fact that miyeon is a former yg trainee and performs this song ❤
=
no one:



literally no one:



Soyeon: *SOOJIN!!!!*
=
yuqi:
everyone: so cute uwu
=
Hairstylist: How many hairbands do you want

Yuqi: Yes
=
Imagine yuqi's hair like that getting to the members face, like ASDFGHJKL
=
Cant stop laughing at Hyejeong licking her lips XD
=
Soojin seriously has one of the sexiest and best body in kpop no cap
=
This is the most viewed gidle queendom performance and yet they came last mnet your gay
=
Shuhua's part is so cute with her voice omg 
=
Still not over the fact this got sixth place, they owned the stage.
=
The fact that MIYEON  was an ex YG trainee I feel like she practiced this so much
=
Soyeon: *Trying to honor a culture*
Everyone who isn’t Indian: “CuLtUrAl appropriation”
=
Unlike everyone else, I came here from 2ne1's MV and some recent commenters are talking about this cover. They're really good! I'm starting to stan them.
=
As a blackjack, my mom really satisfied with this performance, and she was very angry when she knows this performance got 6th place
=
I just want to share something to y’all blackjack doesn’t hate this we’re glad that girl group this day love cover 2ne1 songs heart all of u with love.
=
Никто даже не заметил, что одна из них вообще не пела.....в целом мне все понравилось....но почему для одной они не оставили партии???
=
(G)i-dle really is the best of this generartion. They produced and write their own albums, they are a self-producing group and a versatile group, they are exploring different types of concepts. Each member has their own color and ways to shine. A unique group indeed.
=
Yuqi: breathes 
Everyone else: “AHHH CUTE”
I think she was trying to be sexy not cute even tho she was 
=
queendom: * give idle last place for this performance *
yt viewers: *HOLD MY VIEWERS*
=
Will never get over Soyeon calling Soojin’s name
=
Yuqi is my bias, but damn, there's something with Miyeon's voice that made me fell for her. ❤️❤️
=
I just wanna say that Soyeon is one the best female rappers in the industry,her power.Daaaaamn
=
No one:
Me:
Suddenly
Soyeon: we are the best in this generation, no one can stop us.
Me: WAAAAH! AHHH! YESSSS! LOVEE YAAAS!
=
(G)-IDLE deserved to win queendom. I love MAMAMOO and they did really well. But (G)-IDLE killed it. Im all the performances. They should’ve won.
=
Did anyother girl enjoyed the others' performances AS MUCH as Hyejung.
=
The way bom watching them, she look so proud in their song
=
soojin : *comes out of no where and starts dancing*
fan boys : *suddenly existing cheering loudly*
=
ahhh bom T^T she looked like she was about to tear up at the beginning, they did so well I bet she's really proud and eager to show the clip to all the former members
=
of course they deserve to be the new queens of this generation, they are on another visual level as well as loud and dancing torn voices, I saw the queendom show and honestly they are the best
=
I'm still bitter that we didn't get a studio version of this lol
=
Nobody:
Literally nobody:
No one in this planet:
Soyeon: SOOJIN!
=
Are we not going to talk about Shu Hua at the end like I never thought my I could feel so 
=
I stan the most talented girl group in k-pop
=
Who want them to cover more 2NE1 songs like “I am the best”?
=
white girls get offended when it’s not even their culture to defend  it’s sad really
=
G-idle is so strong in everything. Visual, vocal, rap, dance, dressing, style, concept, performance & entertaining. 
=
G idle is unleashing out of  their comfort zone..
=
i saw this when it came out but so nobody gonna talk about my baby shuhua you could see her confidence on stage coming out
=
yuqi tried to look like sandara but it ended up cutely funny
=
iS ANYONE GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW MINNIE ENDED THIS SONG WITH HER VOICE ALONE OR NAH
=
Still here watching this...i can’t get over it
=
I normally don’t have girl crushes but dang Soojin is gorgeous!
=
No one gonna talk about miyeons vocals and damn her dancing too
Edit: dang 1.3k likes
=
My tears drop every times when Park Bom express her feeling to her past song. There are the precious memories of GG of that generation. I can feel 
=
Ok but they're so stable singing live (you can actually hear their voices over the bgm), can we appreciate that real quick
=
3:21 was that high “OHHH” soojin!!? OMGGG
=
*I'm so whipped for Minnie,Soojin and Soyeon .. They're so sexy*
=
When Bom said:
"i wanna show this to Dara"
I DIED A LITTLE
=
1:47 Miyeon fixing her hair magnificently
=
Miyeon's  voice is sounds like booomm omooo
=
I wanna say a huge THANK YOU to Gidle and especially soyeon for firstly covering this song and doing it JUSTICE. Covering 2ne1s songs are hard just like bigbangs and they did with such grace, style and flair while keeping the flavor of the original is amazing. I have seen many groups covering Fire but this is the first time I felt like they actually got the vibe. 
And I am so thankful that they did in front of Bom..Her touched expression and tears is more than enough for me to feel grateful to the new gen of kpop artists. Respect from a blackjack 
I was a casual Stan of gidle but now I feel that I have to Stan them harder.
=
Cube could afford to let Hyuna go because they knew they had Soyeon. No shade on Queen Hyuna, but if Hyuna and CL have a legitimate heiress, it's her.
Seriously, girl just turned 21, right? Between her stage presence, her writing and producing skills, and indeed her visuals, she might be the most multi-talented idol of her generation.
=
When Park Bom say " I wanna show this to Dara " hmm I could say that Park Bom miss 2NE1 era so much ")
=
Why doesn't every senior like this stage??? It's extremly impressed, isn't it?
=
My thumbs up is for Yuqi's hair.
=
3:53 can we talk about Shuhua's hip movement? Not being a pervert but she did that move so nice.
=
I can see the sadness in park bom eyes. She must miss to perform with other of her 2ne1 members
=
(G)i-dle made Queendom worth to watch.
=
I love the WAY Soyeon shoot Soojin's name as CL did for Park Bom
=
Soyeon always shows that she borns to be on stage, even tho this is ranked 6th i still personally enjoy it the most
=
sorry but .. THIS PERFORMANCE WAS THE BESTTTTTTTT
=
how this got 6th place is beyond me
=
When the fact they only change a bit of the music and just add dance break. But the performance are already these litBest gg of the new generation indeed
=
It hurts me when I see Bom miss her group so much... at the same time I’m happy idle has that 2NE1 sass I smell future dominators
=
I love shuahua’s part. As they say, save the best for last, giving her the last part was brilliantly genius. The way she sings is so soft and sensual but the stage is getting so violent with bursts of fire around them. It’s such an interesting contrast and creates and sounds amazing. Personally, I can’t stop replaying that part.
=
ATTITUDE + SWAG = (G)I-DLE
=
The views from all gidle's queedom performances on youtube say everything
=
every time i see yuqi's hair i laugh haha
she's so adorable <3
=
Should have gotten 1st place,
Snake Mnet: Nope
=
Neverland:(G)I-DLE FİGHTİNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
soojin seems to have the talent of turning everyone gay
=
This is insane omg❣️
=
The feels hit hard when Bom said she wanted to show this performance to Dara ❤️
=
Hi, neverlands! I know you guys may dissapointed by MMA and MAMA who wasn't invited (G)I-DLE. So, we have the chance to make sure that (G)I-DLE will attend the upcoming Seoul Music Awards in this early year by voting for them!
How? You can download the apps called "29th H1 Seoul Music Awards". And we all recommend you guys to focus the vote on Main Category, we currently in 27th rank, and need to be top 12! We all have to work harder for the girls y'all!
=
Soojin off stage: ❤️
Soojin on stage: ❤️⚡✨
=
(G)I-DLE NEVERLAND(G)I-DLE
Miyeon
Minnie
Soojin
Soyeon
Yuqi
Shuhua
=
Unpopular opinion: I prefer this version over the original. I could just be a total Idle bias tho haha
=
Gidle makes me cry. kpop is alive again. They are amazing.
=
When you LOVE 2NE1 and Like (G)-IDLE .. I'm loving this cover 
=
don't worry 2NE1, YG might have forgotten about you, but all the groups and all K-Pop fans will remember 2NE1's legacy !
=
I CANNOT MOVE ON WITH THIS 
=
2NE1 is the EVOLUTION❤
(G)I-DLE is the FIGHTER against ALL❤
FIRE is the debut song of 2NE1 and (G)I-DLE made JUSTICE and made their sunbae 2NE1 PROUD for sure
=
I was really thinking Shuhua wasn't going to sing and then she gave me a heart attack like that???
=
How did this get 6th place? The judges are blind.
=
I love how Soyeon says Soojin!!
=
Can we talk on how a badass song turned sexy because of Soojin. Like , can you step on me , ma'am?
=
Dancers behind dressed like teenage mutant ninja turtles
=
The performance that was ranked 6 has the most views 
=
4:02 when you dont have a chapstick...
=
As a blackjack for 10 years, this was such a beautiful Tribute to 2ne1. Nolza!!!
=
0:49 I hate his reaction, his face confuses me
=
Wey, me muero con Soojin aunque sea niña we
=
3 millions in less than 24 hours is a huge slap to all the haters !
=
they got more views than 2ne1’s 2015 mama performance (not including CL solo), and yet they were ranked last... somethings wrong.
=
Every time I watch this it reminds me that there isn't a studio version ;_;
=
They are soooooooo good at dancing!!!I love (G)I-DLE!!!
=
I literally had goosebumps for this!!
=
I am the one that hear in the first "eh eh eh eoh" the public says "2ne1" ?  The people loves 2ne1
=
No one : 
Me : *looking for comments who're hyping shuhua and put likes*
OMG Thanks for the likes!!
=
seeing my fave girl groups in one video is littt!
=
4:00 "i wish i had her talent"
(Licks her lips)
=
SOOJIN PART IS REALLY IN PERFECT TIMING
=
soyeon: we are the best of this generation
No one can stop us look 
Me: you are the legend's  of this generation no one can stop  that 
=
that guy screaming loud af at the end is me
=
3:56 omg- *_gay panic activate_*
=
YuQi was trying to be sexy but she looks cute :3 also her hair reminds me to Dara's hair 
=
3:37 onwards 
=
This is so lit ❤❤
=
They made Park Bom cry, who stated: "I'm thankful that such great junior artists covered our song." 
The only opinion that matters
=
I don't care for other opinions about this performance as long Park Bom liking it. She even cried bcs it reminds her of 2ne1 old days 
=
4:00 same sis, same
=
If fire was launched in 2019 
=
Bom‘s „i want to show this to dara“ made my cry
=
waaaa yuqi hair....i'm in love <3
=
Shuhua sounds like bby
Y is no one talking about her to☹️
=
Was this the song they was talm bout when one of them said ethnic hip
=
I just have to say one thing to the people speaking badly about this cover: Bom had tears in her eyes and she loved it. Hers and the other 2ne1 members’ opinions are the ones that matter.
=
When yg stop being trash and let us have the studio version of fire ):
=
i cried over bom's reaction
=
fact: soojin is the sexiest women in earth
=
90% of korean comments are pissed off bc this stage got 6th place related af
=
I want to see them in Mama, like this haha
=
15M and placed 6th ? Well mnet
=
as melhores dessa geração SIM ♥
=
I'm crying while watching this vid  
=
I literally sang this song all day
=
*Yall this is the most viewed Queendom stage! Congrats to G-Idle and Neverland!*
=
why is now one talking about this scene 3:12
=
Omg cube raised some monsters ❤️
=
Miyeon.. I Love U so mach ❤
=
Oml @ hyejeong(?) trying to imitate soojin's tongue thing haha
=
Soyeon really can pull of talent her member...
This is way leader part really important on a group,
They have a big responsibilities..
=
Anybody loves Minnie’s voice at the end of the song and her makeup?
=
Bom’s reaction to the performance is everything for me
=
3 months passed and i still got goosebumps
=
SOOJIN ATTACKED ME IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE OMG
=
All yugi wants is to be sexy but everyone thinks shes cute!! 
=
Uwu, Minnie at the End 
Megush
=
yuqi:
everyone: AAAAH SO CUTE
=
1:58 one of our black jack spotted.
=
I like their body. it looks firm and healthy. Especially, their voices are on point.
=
Can I just say these backup dancers did AMAZING... honestly they're one of the factors that made G-idle have such extraordinary performances, the energy and power I cannot （≧∇≦）. Also Shuhua @ the end agghh so beautiful and Soojin gorgeous and sexy solo ❤️
=
"I want to show this to Dara" omg 
=
I like how at 1:13 she screams "soojin" like Cl used to scream "Minzy"
My blackjack heart is so happy right now
=
Sojin at Stage..  Auuumm.  
Really Amazing.   But She Shy Person  
=
2:21 that girl look like v  a little bit
=
This song is so risky and they have a big shoes to fill. G-idle did a fantastic job covering this song. Considering they rearranged this whole song themselves and did alot of things themselves in short period of time, I really admire this group. They are very talented and such phenomenal artist. ❤️
=
Best perfomance in k-pop industry
=
Mini loveyou❤️❤️
=
I miss 2ne1✨
=
Soojin❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
a darker and sexier take on "Fire" as a blackjack, i not only approve, I STANNNNNNN
=
they are the best of this generation , this is a fact 
=
Legend performance.
=
I just say "WOW"
=
i love that minnie ends the song <3
=
minnie’s visual in this perf aosknsjwjs 
=
Shuhua's sweet voice  I can't 
=
soojin reminds me of park jihoon from wanna one(just my opinion)
=
Nobody is going to mention how happy Soyeon looks?
=
I need the studio version of this cover in my life so much, like right now 
=
damn this song is stil fire
=
I’m telling yallllllll g idle is the next 2ne1
=
i wish we could get 2ne1’s reaction
=
2ne1
=
Wow miyeon is singing a song from her ex-company! I love it i-
=
4:02
Who is this artist?
She got seduced by Soojin. 
=
Love G idle and mamamoo’s reactions 
=
Best kpop gruop actually , Soojin aura kill me
=
I can feel how this performance nearly made bom cry because i feel the same, i miss this era
=
It's so insane that this got 6th place! This performance was awesome!
But coming from Mnet it's not really a surprise... We all know they manipulate everything
=
THEY DID SO WELL
=
Yuqi shaking her pigtails
The girl idols:cutie aw cute
The amount of cuteness yuqi has is overloading 
=
Soy la unica que en la parte donde dicen get up escucha "quiero" ?
=
1:59 so cuteeeeee
=
3:56
I replay 5x
=
Shuhua is such a goddess
=
if Idle did it exactly like how 2ne1 does this song, they would have been called copycat..but no they’ve done it Idle style..
=
So Cuteeeeeee <3
=
Shuhua's voice
=
yuqi:
everyone else: ahHhh so cute!
=
Korean blind that give them number 6
=
i like that when Soyeon shout Soojin
=
Only search queendom and i am here
=
I miss 2ne1 together 
=
Okay but that grown man singing in the crowd made me go 
also seeing Bom throughly enjoy this made me go  as well
=
Soyeon shouting "Soojin" and mc-ing the whole time! Stunning!! I love them all so much!!
=
2ne1 in MAMA 
=
I miss you 2ne1 T^T
=
They need to do a tutorial on those makeup looks. This is amazing x
=
Omg im dead at 4:02 
=
yuqi: tried to be cool
everyone:
literally everyone:


Ahhhh CUTEEEE
=
Okay soojin, i went str8 for u
=
Iam watching produce 101 and i dont know why iam here LMAO 
=
This performance was incredible ahh
=
No6!!!!!! .. Are You Crazy Mnet ???
=
Im sorry but my eyes were focused the whole time on soyeon she's amazing!
=
3:55 free replay button :>
=
As a blackjack, this makes me proud. I was grinning the whole video. Soyeon was perfect.
=
Who are the girls from 2:21 and 2:53  and  3:46 ? They look interesting 
=
Yuqi sounds like minzy,shuhwa sounds like dara
=
DAMN THE TALENT THAT INVOLVED IN THIS PERFORMANCE
=
so nostalgic! i will always love and cherish 2NE1 and GIDLE really did them justice!! <3 <3 <3 LOVE!!!
=
this video just proved that seo soojin is the hottest woman alive
=
The tribute that 2NE1 deserve!
=
Thank you for covering this song my one and only fav group 2ne1❤
=
Queens 
=
17m? We can Queens like a Lions⚔️️️
=
Awww Bom looks like she want to cry and she’s also very proud too
=
Why the heck am I crying
=
Soyeon saying “SOOJIN” before soojin stole everyone’s wigs. A moment so pleasing to me
=
3:55 thank me later
=
I keep repeating shuhua's part
=
Me an Indian watching this comment section lol.Funny how people try to bring the talk of racism at a small sniff of anything controversial.
=
Damn,Soojin is so hot
=
aHhh, this is stuck in my head I NEED A STUDIO VERSION HSJSHSHS
=
13.5m coming
=
I am the man at 1:58 :D :D
=
It's amazing how gidle is  a one year old group and they have this much charisma and stage presence . One of the things that made them so different from the other rookies was that they didn't looked like rookies  .
=
3:57 killer 
=
Sojeon 's so hot ❤️
=
I loved Shuhua’s part. I love her voice and her visuals r amazing
=
OH MY GOD THEY SLAYYYYYEEEEDDD!!!!
=
DO u know how many times I loop this MV? hehehe a lot!! I LOVE IT
=
Deserve top most v*ews in Channel 1thek perfomance
=
Imagine 20m only cover
=
Soyeon reminds me of CL so much and I’ve been saying that since I seen her on unpretentious rap star . And this proved it
=
We are the best of this generation:)
=
Vote them on Asia artist award. Blackjack here to help because we stan talent not fame.
=
This could be 1st
=
i’m teary eyed :____
=
2:57 literally Fire 
=
Bom Watching Yuqi part 
Park Bom : “ I want to show this to DARA” 
=
Soyeon and Soojin are so damn on FIIIIIIIRE
=
2:16 Ang kyotttt charot HAHAHA
=
“ I wanna show this to dara” Park Bom   
Who’s crying with me?
=
This is giving me Indian vibes~
=
Bom is like a proud mother, 2ne1 should see this omggg
=
Please appreciate shuhua too like for real she has improved so much ❤️❤️ I’m so proud of her ! And her beauty is just mesmerising ❤️❤️❤️
=
Eu te amo Yuqiiiii❤❤❤❤
=
My bias ranking:
1-Minnie
2-Soyeon
3-Soojin
4-Shuhua
5-Yuqi
6-Miyeon
they are perfect 
I LOVE
=
4:14 damn Shuhua 
=
On Dara’s Instagram story she said she wants (G)I-DLE to cover more 2ne1 songs. I just really want them to do Clap Your Hands
=
still can't believe this landed 6th...??????....
=
I CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF THAT SOOJIN 4:04
=
soyeon calling soojin's name is like cl calling minzy i am emo
=
When Soyeon Calls Soojin
Soojin Nuga Mu Geomnu
=
Shuahua ENDING !!!! LIT !!!! 
=
Sandara Park given her approval of this, she posted on her instagram she look forward to gidle to perform their other 2ne1 songs. Bom and Dara approved. I am waiting for Minzy and CL 
=
I miss 2ne1
=
1:14 Soyeon's 'Soojin!' is so cute
=
Soyeon popped off in this performance
=
Yuqi: **breath**
Mamamoo, AOA, Park Bom, Lovelyz and Oh My Girl: hOw cUtE
=
Nobody: 
Soyeon at 4:29:Having the time of her life!
=
They are so authentic and such amazing artists. <3 In this performance Shuhua really killed it! So happy she got her time to shine, she has such an amazing voice!
=
OMG ! Soojin ! I LOVE YOU !!!!!
=
Why is no one talking about Minnie's voice fitting the chorus so much????
=
I love you so much SHUHUA Ｏ (≧ ▽ ≦) Ｏ
=
argghhh Soojin make me crazy
=
Yes YG stop acting like 2ne1 didn't happen and let people cover 2ne1 songs!!!
=
Guess what? Queen Soyeon could arrange this song to 360° with (a+b)2 = a+2b+b, but she hides her secret weapon.
=
2:30
Yukiiiiiii 
Ilove you ✌✌✌
=
4:06 how soyeon enter my life
=
The fact that park bom actually showed this to dara and both of them liked it 
And dara said that they should cover more of their songs 
So what we all care about is that 2ne1 members liked it or not
=
Nightmare versión channel official (G)idle trending 2hours
=
My 2nd gen heart is crying
=
11 years later and this song is still a BOP. LEGENDS 2NE1 FOREVER
=
Soyeon and CL my only favorite kpop rapper so far. :)
=
Why am i crying watching this 
=
Bom constantly remembering her members .... Wish they could perform once more together .
=
Park bom: i wanna show it to dara hahahaha omg 
=
so y’all are telling me this placed 6th-
=
This and Park Bom performing Hann. LEGENDS. OH MY GOD.
=
Out of all part of fire, dara's line is the hardest to cover. Great job G-Idle. 
=
I read alot of comments compared them to 2ne1.. Wait why compared them tho? Its obvious g-idle cover this song with their own flavour as same as park bom cover hann with her own flavour.. Both songs sound good to me..
=
1:14 I'm addicted to the moment when soyeon scream soojin
4:12 Shuhua looks like the card  who leads  her  owner to the victory
=
G-idle the Queens of all stages
=
how dare you soojin. How. Dare. You.
=
Imagine if you had Soyeon and Hwasa’s stage presence like WTF.
=
G IDLE is just a year old, but they take risks. It might be unsatisfying to others, but if this is their step towards a greater success, surely they took a big step. More so they just don't buy their songs, they compose, write and produce their own songs since their debut song (even before debuting in gidle) especially their leader soyeon. 
=
My favourite girl group (g)i-dle
=
(G)I-DLE making people forget that they are only 1 year old group. Only (G)I-DLE
=
they owned that shitttttttt 
=
I dont know y im abt to cry,  i love 2ne1 & gidle
=
The amount of view imf
=
Shuhua always got line up surprise ^^
=
This gruop are insane
=
4:11 
=
I miss 2ne1 :(
=
Yuqi: looks so fierce 
Everyone: owaaaa so cute
=
2:41 meeee
=
Best cover of 2ne1 song love it love them
=
That girl with violet top looks badass af. She beautiful tho
=
came here for seeeing the viewwwwww..... i want a view and subcribesssss..f akk my lifeee
=
not the 2NE1 vibe for me. still proud for them for having a tribute to 2NE1 thanks G-(IDLE)
=
thank you, miyeon, for the amazing job :) hope you can get more parts like that on your next comeback. i'm really sorry that you're still underrated and your company doesn't give you the lines you deserve. but we are here, all of your fans, supporting you!
=
That old man at 1:58 singing to 2NE1 is me 100 years later still loving this song.
=
Soyeon's so hot
=
Sojin very sexy  
=
They deserve to come last
=
yuqi's face and voice doesnt match i love it
=
I love yuqi!!!
=
After QueenDom we Stan Park Bom, G-Idle, Mamamoo and OMG
=
3:56-3:58.....
Miss Seo Soojin
Stop it.
I'm------
=
Therapy: expensive
Soyeon saying "soojin" after her verse: *FREE*
=
Minnie’s voice killed me
=
this was so nostalgic they rlly had the same energy as when 2NE1 would perform this :((
=
its over months but i still need to say , shuhua slayyyy mf
=
I wheezed at 4:03 HAHAHAHAHA
=
is there a playlist or a name for this kind of mix for this (idols singing each others songs )  in english title please
=
まってww itzyかと思った爆笑爆笑
=
........Perfect!!! Nostalgic AF!! Still fresh though!!! 
=
1:59 fanboy 2ne1 =)))
=
15M 
=
Soyeon is a one of a kind artist in kpop. Her charisma and talent is over the roof.
=
I LOVE SHUHUA'S VOICE I WANNA CRY I LOVEYOUSOMUCHOMG
=
i had *goosebumps*
=
4:28 Okay, but like my Queen Soyeon be going HARD!
=
Ох, какие горячие девааачкиии
=
Why are yall mad if it isn’t your culture to begin with? Im african and im happy to see our culture being used in a good way
=
Soyeon = CL
=
Shit!. Soyeon calling soojin make me got a goosebumps suddenly!
=
I’m just never gonna stop saying this, but Yuqi in this video and performance seriously looks like Yeji from ITZY at certain angles.
=
Watching this makes me miss 2ne1 even more
=
Love their performance
=
I just cant stop watching this♡
=
True blackjacks appreciate this cover while fake blackjacks saying this is the  worst performance.
=
Yuqiiiiii❤❤❤❤
=
Omgggg soojin!  So hoooot!
=
Currently crying because Soyeon saying "Soojin" is like how CL said "Minzy" on 2ne1's MAMA 2015 performance
=
1:06 as dançarinas  eu descia e não levantava mais.. puts nem descia
=
ethnic hip queens 
=
Are most of (g)idle’s fans international? I feel like their performances views ranked so high on here and yet on Queendom they always got voted lower.
=
13m views oH YEAHHHHH
=
3:56 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Soyeon slay it
=
I’m not  crying you are
=
Soyeon might be small but she absolutely fills the stage 
=
I hope to see them attending MMA, MAMA etc in future.
=
私はクリップがとても好きでした
=
2NE1❤️
=
Soyeon look like CL
=
Soyeon: "We are the best of this generation. No one can stop us."
Only Soyeon can have the confidence to say that and disregard the hates from other fandoms, cuz she's confident and she have and will prove it...
=
Everyone meet our Queen CL's Daughter! *Jeon Soyeon*
=
soyeon is vibing sO HARD
=
So yeah, ca.
=
That old man singing is definitely some of the 2nd gen fan LOL
=
Soyeon, yuki, mini, shuhua  I still do not remember the name of the other girl
=
Why did I see this so late. What is the concept of this show??
=
im not even mad they placed last on this one considering they had this mucu stage presence when they've only been a one year group. idle will still come far, *fight me*
=
I like how they didn’t make drastic changes and too much extra additions with the song it makes it an authentic and genuine take on covering a legendary group like 2ne1. I think they didn’t want to ruin the song while still adding their g-idle flavor
=
Yuqi's cuteness is overflowing ☺️
=
Soyeon dad? I think I saw him in unpretty r.
=
When the cameraman thought Miyeon is gonna do the signature leg step so the camera was focused on the legs.. But Miyeon didn't do it Hahaha
=
I love it when soyeon screams "Soojin!"
OMG GUYS NEVER EXPECTED THESE LIKES FROM YALL. THANKS AND S+R34M THEIR PERFORMANCE LUV
=
Oh... miss Shuhua ♡
=
this was 6th place????
=
Amazing cover!
=
4:00 Same girl, SAAME
=
Hmm when gidle or bp or rv invite in award
=
Me quede loca. 
Ahre que nadie habla español o eso creo. 
( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
=
16m today 12m lion perfomances
=
minnie and miyeon with those vocals tho, like damn
=
I was thinking it didn’t find right at fast but as the song went along it got better loved it great job girls
=
*I TRANSLATED THOSE KOREAN COMMENTS, AND THEY'RE SO MAD THAT G-IDLE PLACED LAST BECAUSE THEY DID BETTER, its my first time to agree with k-netz*
=
i need a studio version of this
=
If they liked it then Why were they placed last Aren't u disappointed if yes like if no comment
=
1:57 us in 20 yrs
=
I still refuse to believe they came last with this performance
=
Best part 4:13
=
Soyeon: "We are the best in this generation. No one can stop us."
Me: i know sis.
=
shuhua killing me
=
1:14
=
You are the best female K-pop in my ♥
=
3:45 WHO S THAT
=
Legends
=
I turned gay because of yuqi’s “hey” (2:29)
=
fck this Soojin's part was so.. GOOD 3:55
=
Ohh my Soojin and Shuhua.
=
Why i crying as soon i heard this song !! I miss 2ne1
=
I LIKE THAT...
=
Fight Lion mv
=
the fact that this video is trending again prove that they deserve better
=
2:57
=
Other lv in k-pop
=
Too bad they didn't win. I miss 2ne1 
=
They are always different but so pretty:)
=
Breath Soojin!!
=
They did well but for me this song is way too iconic that I can’t forget the original, 2NE1’s voices and style are too distinct for IDLE to pull this off convincingly esp since they didn’t change much about the style. And omg bom’s reaction to this made me teary 
=
YG CRYING
=
I love shuhua part at 4:11
=
Bom: "I want to show this to Dara". thank you, I cried
=
งง ยอดคนดูเยอะสุดในรอบนี้ ต้นฉบับนั่งดูยิ้มไม่หุบ
แย่กว่าต้นฉบับตรงไหนว่ะ ได้ที่6 เหมือนโกงอ่ะ
=
goosebumps. They are excellent performers!
=
yuqi: tries to be sexy
contestants: OHH SOO CUTE
=
Omg Miyeon~~~
=
G IDLE MA QUEENNNNN!!!
=
ok i'll make it cleary , they cant make " fire " ghostboomb like 2ne1 do but they do is the best cover.... AOA is my Bias forever but Gidle make it really happen than AOA. i play this even most than i play AOA Egoistic but So sad the got 6th Rank. :( dont hate me please , i just say my honesty....

=
Sandara Park or Dara (to those who dont know she’s former 2ne1 member) just posted on her insta story about complementing (G)i-dle
Translations: “hoobae Gidlenim are so cool”
“You gotta fire ”
“hoobae please sing more of our songs in the future”
=
3:55
=
老實說我比較喜歡2NE1的版本！
她們的live即使沒有伴舞氣場都是一流！
謝謝但辛苦了
=
3:55
=
Was waiting for shuhua’a moment and she killed it :’))
=
Hwasa 
=

=
OMG 
=
4.05 the hottest performance i've ever seen...
=
OMH YUQI WITH DARA'S PINEAPPLE HAIR
=
Real and cover. Wow!!!!
=
Who appreciated G Idle?
=
Their energy omg ahhhhhh
=
Is hard but this song is better original, more poweful, more epic.
=
Looks like I have to stan gidle now 
=
Soyeon always puts her all into every performance and you can really tell she was made for the stage
=
C'mon new Queens of kpop
=
Me encsnto esta parte 4:27 ; )
=
Park bom cried and said she is grateful that a group like gidle coverd their songs
=
คนไทย
=
Literally everyone screaming Cute at Yuqi >>>
=
i keep coming back here becase im a blackjack fan.
=
they are the best of their generation indeed.
=
Queens
=

=
Soojin, stop bias wrecking me!!!
=
Queens of kpop
=
That Soyeon Girl is so Badass
=
3:46 ?
=

=
3:55
=
Park bom cover GIDLE song. GIDLE covering 2NE1 song.
=
1:59
=
Ooh I heard  gidle was called out for cultural appropriation for wearing a bindi. I don't see why blackpink wasn't called out because jennie too had one in the dudddu mv. That's not fair bashing the rookies alone. I have seen a couple of kdrama where they clearly make fun of Indian culture with Korean men wearing bindi and all like why remain so ignorant, if you don't appreciate another culture don't use thier stuff for your aesthetics. I really don't mind gidle wearing bindi but I hate it when they (Korean Society)stereotype and mock others but then still choose to take thier culturally significant symbols for glamorizing. Ooh and I am an Indian myself.
=
Did DARA go inside SHUHUAs body? I was ShockedImpressive!!!
=
1:58 это я кста
=
QUEENS!!!
=
Esta canción  y coreografía es muy buena se merece  un mv✨✨
=
im here because of miyeon
=
Idle will be big. They exude that aura- that legendary aura. The talent will pay off someday i just know it
=
Why can’t I find this on Spotify?
=
3:36
=
4:04
=
2ne1 is the best. THE LEGENDARY QUEENS
=
All of them are beautiful but SHUHUA's Visual is so unreal she looks like a princess from a fantasy drama .. Stan Talent .. Stan OT6 ... Stan IDLE ..
=
3:41
=
So this is how it feels when miyeon is singing and dancing to YG’s song
=
4:03
=
 
=
@ 3:46 i thought she was jane from momoland
=
This is the attention G-idle really deserves.
=
Of all the great performance they had this is their best, as of now. Kodus to our queen. 
=
I’m crying
=
واوو 
=
*I'm African ( Morocco) and I'm not offended at all. Anyways Shuhua killed it.*
=
OMg THE BEST COVER EVER.. I LOVE BOTH MY QUEENSS

=

=
Instead of enjoying the perfomance, I sang the whole song lol
=

=
*My exams r coming and I am here watching these...*

=
Cl would be pround watch this
=
Haters pretending there 2ne1 fans am sorry but gidle are gidle you canr expect them to be like 2ne1.  They coverd it not became 2ne1
=

=
2:42 The fanboy screaming and this fangirl are a mood
=
1:59
=
Fire!!
=
2:14 yuqi must thinking that she was swag but everyone called her cute
=

=
0:59
=
Bom: i wanna show this to dara
=
I want to see a performance of Minzy with Soojin, Dara with Yuqi and Shuhua, Bom with Minnie and Miyeon, and CL with Soyeon! My idols! ♠
=
Oh my god! The scream of the fanboy at the end... same dude same
=

=
My bias is Miyeon and I thought she's the visual. But after I saw shuhua here... My God she's a Goddess All of them is pretty tho
=
(G)I-DLE was always on the top!!!
=
30m 3 perfomance queendom coming
=
Love you girl❤
=
Awkward moment when the last place got the most view, l hate mnet 
=
My 1st love kpop song ever ..
=
Who's crying?
You!
=
My Minnie!! 
=
(g)-idle is too good for queendom
=
They are the best! I’m sad that they got the last place!!!
=
I miss 2ne1 (crying) who else miss the queens?
=
Legends
=
Idle new song... Lion 
=
Omg I got chills all over my body. I need a comeback right now with an album! I hope cube are not dumb they must use Gidle popularity now. So after Queendom I hope there will be a comeback with the right promotion they can replace one of the Big3 GG
=
Lion is out on spotify
=
3:56
=
So this last place ranked performance is the most viewed. 12.8 million right now. PPl know who the real winners are. G idle are legends in the making.
=
the starting of the song gave me bollywood vibes lol how was that jungle in fact it sounds like an instrumental of a song i heard really ago . also sorry for my english :)
=
WE ARE IDLE
=
Bom had tears on her eyes . Imagine making  your idol proud.  Cant relate
=
3:54
=
Thank you to those Blackjacks who are appreciated this cover. We know , 2ne1 songs is untouchable and iconic, no one can duplicate 2ne1 presence and charisma and swag. But please dont mock or underestimating gidle, they do really respect 2ne1 and look at BOM shes about to cry to reminiscing her members. I just want you all to know these girls are only 1 year old in kpop industry but they are self produced idols , they choreograph themselves too. Please appreciate their effort for this song .
=
Soyeon 
=
Saying that Yuqi is cute when she tried to be badass is such a MOOD
=
SHUHUA SLAYED IT QUEEEEEEN
=
(G) I-DLE has new title track called Lion. Stream it on Melon and other charts. Also available on iTunes. The song is an absolute bop.
=
(G)-idle promoting 2ne1 better than yg
=
For me , this performance is No. 1 
=
after a cool breakdance 



the cute maeknae shuhua comes out
=
From the beginning of the performance they said that they are IDLE, this is a cover and every group is different why did everyone expect them to give the same vibe that 2ne1 gives.
=
1:13-1:30
=
Ketagihan gw haha
=
Send '5' to +820011 to vote for them now!!
=
Miyeon took bom's part  thank god boths left YG HAHA
=
13m yas
=
im gay for minnie, soojin, and miyeon periodt
=
Their supere original omg
=
*Soojin is making me a lesbian. Damn, she's so hooooot. (Insert "Fiiiiiire" part of BTS' Fire)*
=
Nobody noticed Shuhua is literally amazing in hip movements. I'm not being a pervert it is intentional cause the lyrics translate to something along the lines of "Shake your booty gently"
=
I like how SHUHUA came at the end .
She is really awesome 
=
Everytime Soojin came on screen i was like O_O or 
=
TIME TO VOTE NEVIES! IDLE IS NOMINATED FOR 3 CATEGORY :

=
I just noticed Soyeon says Soojin’s name at 1:14
=
Happy birthday to DREAMY MINNIE (October 23rd 1997)
I love and support minnie and all members forever.
=
*Sojin wrecking my bias list @3:57
=
3:55
=
i have been wondering for a couple of weeks now and watching it a couple of times cant see the problem here why r they last?
=
Koreans: not putting any subs and even putting only Korean in the title
Me: is this a personal attack or something?
=
I wondered why they were not win and got top 1 ??????
=
almost 13M
=
0:59
Who is that girl?
She is so cute and indulging in the performance.
=
I honestly think that shuhua's the cutest in this performance of (g)i-dle
=
They're make their song with popular song or make popular groups dances
What a clever thing!
=
LOL imagine the burden on Gi-dle's part. They placed 1st on the first round, they're the maknae, they have to cover the legendary debut song of the legendary girl group 2ne1. Everyone expected too much from our girls. They did their best and I bet if any other gg will cover 2ne1's song it'll be considered a success to even pull off Gi-dle's level of cover. Well done girls! We are very proud of you to even make this cover a success despite your busy schedule. Take note they self produce almost everything. I hope that makes it another point for them.
=
Does anyone notice how pretty and sexy Shuhua on this performance? 
=
Dara said she loved Idle's performance and that she wanted to hear more covers from them. 
Haters keep talking, Idle keep walking
=
The fact that Miyeon was the part of 'The Next 2NE1' tho lol
=
I can't say That Gidle may be the best kpop girl group on this generation but their aura on the stage is incredible and unbeatable <3 especially soojin and the blond one sorry guys I'm just new to them
=
Okay let's don't forget that they are still rookies okay.
=
why nobody talks about soojin. this girl is burning PLEASE NOTICE HER MOVEEEEEEEEEEE
=
Gidle's popularity has really led a lot of people to go out of their way to kill them. The haters followed suit and attacked them, but they didn't even know what cultural appropriation was~ which reminds me of a massive attack on an American girl for wearing a Chinese Cheongsam to her prom, and the irony is that the real Chinese have been overwhelmingly supportive of that beautiful girl.
=
they're the best of this generation, and no one can stop they.
=
The power
=
Hwasa cantando..kkk
=
This performance is already ICONIC 
I'm sorry for the haters who are afraid of the power of (G)i-dle
=
still cant believe this performance ranked last
=
I was waiting for shuhua
=
THEIR STAGE PRESENCE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD....THEY ARE AMAZING! THEY ARE QUEENS OF THIS GENERATION! WOW, I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!
=
Soyeon looked like she was having way too much fun 
=
Shuhua's part is literally on 
=
Hyeojong : i wish i had her talent "then try to copy" xD
girl you are already an all rounder and had good talent to <3
=
彼らは業界で最高です
=
Glad more Korean comments！
I hope they are all good comments.
GIdle deserves more recognition in South Korea.
=
the fact that soojin can pull off a very sexy strong concept onstage makes me forget that she’s a shy person in real life sometimes..
=
SHUHUAAAAAAAAAA <3
=
Não tem desculpa A MINNIE ESTÁ MARAVILHOSA 
=
Thank you gidle for bringin this great song back to the lights it means alot for us ❤️
=
Can't control of Yuqi's cuteness
=
idle:WE ARE THE BEST OF THIS GENERATION
world:‍♀️‍♀️‍♀️‍♀️‍♀️
=
I've wondered why they got 6th place for this show? In my opinion they did it very well.
=
15m both 30days one perfomance yas
=
OH MY GOD
=
Still waiting for this cover to come available on iTunes 
=
Best perfomance in kpop ever
=
Welcome trolls 4:12
=
3:55 you died
=
I bet everyone really miss this song so much as i am
=
15m coming
=
3:55
=
It’s funny that they got last place for this performance but look this is the most viewed performance from queendom. I still don’t believe the ranking tho (not to say they deserve first or second because some other group are really good too but atleast not the last)
=
Keep stream
=
My queens
=
Shuhua 
=
La park bom ni puede expresarse de tanto botox
=
3:56 
=
Can’t believe this wonderful performance is the 6th :) thanks mnet
=
Bom have a teary eyes watching them, she miss 2ne1 so much so bad
=
Good job .
=
4:47 
=
After this performance I have the confirmation that Soyeon is the hidden daughter of CL. :)
=
*I still can't believe they got LAST PLACE for this performance TT*
=
Bom rooting for Miyeon as part of the YG Dungeon Coalition 
=
Nobody can seem to 2ne1, 2ne1 are the queens 
=
بتعرفوا انو في وحدة منهم كانت بدها تدخل الي فرقة بلاك بينك بس هني نقوها في هاي الفرقة
=
Ohhhh..MG. I love this performance. It is another great version of 'Fire'. They bring many great ideas to the song. But it seem their voice drop from singing while powerful dance. If it was studio version play along with stage performance that will be Perfect. Original still Masterpiece, But I love this one too. Sad for them to get 6th in this round.
=
OKAY THAT'S IT I'M GAY
=
Soyeon : We are The Best Of Our Generation
Did they lie? I don't think so.....
=
secret ace weapon
3:56
=
park bom say : " i wanna show this to Dara! " ... uhhh <333
=
The short hair girl killed it
=
2:21 i would like to know name of the girl on the right please
And which band she is from
=
I’m addicted on this video
=
Soojin's expression here is killing me
=
"We are the best this generetion"
True
=
Soyeon being a singer and rapper here.❤️
=
i come back to this song a lot to just remind myself how cute yuqi is even if she tries to be cool
=
Fanboy screaming in audience, I feel ya
=
Hyejeong seductively licking her lips is the hottest thing I've ever seen
Hyejeong: "I wish I had her talent."
also Hyejeong: (makes the sexiest face in the history of sexiness)
=
13M keep stre*ming neverlands
=
This makes me wanna stan (G)Idle even more 
=
played this a hundred times and still so f*cking good 
=
Why did they cut away when Minnie gave that ending smile???  4:45
=
3:37 yes, Soyeon, you guys are
=
minnie so cute~
=
Ohh did i just heard it right? they shout "2NE1"  0:13

=
Amo o grupo, porém elas tem que comer muito arroz e feijão ainda
=
May I know what show is this? Thank you~ 
=
Literally how did this get last place
=
Keren parah sih
=
they deserve a higher ranking than 6th
=
Even knetz think it’s ridiculous that idle placed 6th
=
Wow @ from Cambodia 
=
miyeon's vocal still really suit yg song after all these years. lol
=
Dude, you realize how iconic this song is? You can see all the girls in the back singing along the song. From MAMAMOO to AOA.
=
That "EH EH" part in the beginnig was sung by YuQi?! 
=
Legends
=
When bom said she wants to show it to dara 
=
รายการอะรัยอ่ะ
=
It is *very hard* to cover a 2ne1 song but these girls did amazing, especially considering the fact that they're rookies. Blackjack approved.
=
i love how no matter yuqi tries to be swag and tough, everyone calls her cute 
=
Soyeon 
=
Am I the only one? Yuqi is like Sandara's child and Soyeon is like Chaerin's child
=
Is this the most viewed performance in queendom so far? I can't believe they placed last with this performance.
=
Where is soojin's tattoes?
=
Which ones the one at 3:46?
=
يليت يشيلون رياكشن هالمتصنعات
=
Why is no one talking about Minnie's stability? She was on *FIRE*
=
4:034:034:03
4:034:034:03
=
16M in 2moths
=
I WANT A STUDIO VERSION OF THIS
=
Soyeon is another level of stage presence noone can top her in korea currently
=
They're totally ripping the stage. I love how they're all singing on stage. They show true talent. I just saw the older guy in the audience stanning so hard. That's all of us.
=
It's not that I'm baised to (G)I-dle but they really deserve winning queendom (no offense to other idols I do love them too, but (G)I-dle really killed it!)
=
damn g idle getting a lot of views on this show
=
11k dislike from jalouse people who didn't like (G)i-dle because they are so talented and beautiful " Queens  "
=
4:03 the girl licking her lips while looking at the girl on stage ❤️
=
Now (G)I-DLE is the most viewed Queendom perfomance
=
0:58 the cutest reaction
=
who's here after watching gidle performance today❤
=
there was too much fog especially during the chorus as well, just seemed to me like they tried to cover certain blemishes TT
=
3:56 *soojin just killed a punch of gay girls rn*
=
4:12 you welcome
=
0:04 2ne1 or (G)I-DLE?
=
I can only hear their gold and diamonds rings and pieces of jewelry lol
=
This is going on my iconic perfomances list
=
SOOJIN <3
=
Soyeon❤
=
This was so good, wtf
=
Watching Miyeon's part made me think "at least one of them is allowed to cover their unnies." =]
=
Boom : i wanna show this to dara
Me : (crying )
=
*I NEED A COMEBACK OF (G) I-DLE. Bye*
=
Best tribute ever
=
Shuhua's voice is heaven
=
Amazing  performance ❤️❤️❤️
=
SOYEON ❤❤❤❤❤
=
Thank u. For giving justice of 2n1 songs....
=
00:05 , the fanchants, they said "2ne1"
=
G idle obviously FREAKIN SLAYED...but can we just appreciate the backup dancers?They were amazing especially during the dance break and  soyeons bit when they went back onto the ground, that must be really hard! 0:30 1:07 3:43
=
They did Yuqi dirty with that hair hahahaha
=
Best kpop gruop ever (G)idle
=
when shuhua was in the center, she seemed to be moving a bit too fast in comparison with the beats and other girls..
i feel like not all the girls are as good in dancing.. which is why the stage suffered a bit.
just my opinion though, they don't have to all be aces in it
i love the girls and concept regardless
=
1:58 en la vida yo soy este hombre
=
Nightmare 2m in 20hours
=
Happy 12 millions
=
Park Bom - best!
=
Who else is crying? Blackjacks, this bring back so much memories
=
"We're the best of this generation, no one can stop us" 
-Jeon Soyeon, 2019
=
2019 Soyeon reminds me of 2009 CL... her stage presence is no joke
=
Can’t believe they ranked last. Even Park Bom the original singer of the song approved them. I hope Soyeon will be really really mad and make the next song arrangement to her very best that nobody can beat their performance in queendom.
=
Why nobody talking about Shuhua?? Thought the line is less but she still great.
=
Tomorrow video official Minnie Empire
=
No.1 or not, the only thing that matter is they make Park Bom proud of them and that the real prize,an appreciation from a legend.
=
Soojin wasn't there to perform, she came to slaughter us
=
"I wanna show this to Dara" aww so cute
=
Yuqi: *exists*
Everyone: *AH CUTE*
=
The views high to the top literally at 6 place, neverland views is no joke
=
Even (G) I- DLE  got last on this round but we got first place for brand reputation of girl group. 
I m sure the next stage going to be legendary.
=
12M!!! Queens did that! 
=
i dont believe this is the performance that can got 6th
=
Legends
=
Soyeon, soojin and minnie stage presence really are something
=
Soojin at 3:56 WOW shes got it. shes got the it factor. congratulations.
=
They rly hit 12MIL omgggg
=
Justice for 2ne1 (G)idle is the most view in Queendom, the power Next generation

=
Suhuhaaomgg
=

=
I cried. I feel bom missing her group.
=
حبيييت
=

=

=
xdiooos shushuaa la voz de esta piba es la melodía más suave que jugó bien con el tono, el baile y la última escena de fuego tipo todas las chicas combinaron a la perfección.
=
How did they rank so low?!
=
Devil works hard but soojin works harder
=
You can't never underestimate g-idle
=
1. To all the BLACKJACKS who appreciated our girls THANK YOU SO MUCH from the bottom of our heart .  - Neverlands
2. To all the negative people hating our girls its okay we can't force you all to like them but we all wish you peepz will find peace in your heart that full of hates. They said if you hate someone who doesn't do bad things to you means you are living a miserable life.
 We would like to remind you that this is (G) I-DLE "FIRE" version anyway.
=
I love Minnie's ending! She has strong stage appearance
=
*Bom* reaction to *Miyeon* I'm crying right now because I was waiting for this moment
=
Streammmmm
=
Damn soojin
=
When Soyeon said, "We are the best of this generation. No one can stop us" girl aint lying.
=
Soojing is the queen of seduction
=
Gosh I think 2ne1 is Back!!!
=
2:00  kim hyang gi???
=
Soyeon has CL's aura 
=
I’m shook. Minnie’s outfit fits her hair so much. Soojins Lip Licking And Her ‘Hump(Sound of air) is so cool XD. And idk why y’all not talking bout it but don’t u guys find yuqis boom boom boom sounds so cool XD
=
park bom like.  omo i want to dance with my member right now..  
=
Honestly, their vocal is not as good as other groups but Soyeon definitely hard carried the team. Her stage presence and rap are seriously good.
=
Love it
=
yuqi: does literally anything
everyone: *cute* *cute*
=
No one can top soyeon's stage presence in this generation
=
yuqi :I'm good I'm hot I'm fresh I'm fly
everyone :kiyooooooooo
=
bom's tears are everything. it really shows how much she misses those 2ne1 golden days
=
how the hell they placed last T.T i still don't get it until today.....
=
It's sad that there's no such version on Spotify.
=
No one:
Yuqi: does anything
Everyone: 2:17
=
I hope that (G)-IDLE Is the winner of the Queendom Because they are very good and I think they have a good voice And exotic music styles for me So I want (G)-IDLE to be number one Otherwise I am a fan club from Thailand and minnie He is also a member of the band That is Thailand So I therefore want to support (G)-IDLE Foreigners, they will accept that my country Amazing!
So I would like to cheer for (G)-IDLE And I will follow the work of (G)-IDLE Forever.
I love (G)-IDLE I love (G)-IDLE!!
=
when i first heard the intro i had to thik abt the movie "zootopia" xD
i really liked their cover and their theme.
their stage presence is no joke :0
=
I honestly loved everything about this performance, I can’t understand why they ranked so low  This performance and AOA’s stood out to me, everyone else’s was amazing too
=
The power of (G)idle
=
4:00
Im Literally on the floor
=
This video is always on my recommended and I'm glad
=
I think that the fans are also to blame, I mean, all the most famous idols and groups are not great, we should appreciate the variety that gives us visuality, before criticizing, but we hope we are the only human being who kills for fun.
=
get ready to stream put it straight once it’s out nevies!! we gonna break youtube
=
Shuhua looked great in this performance (any performance tbh), she's so photogenic, great stage presence, and a great dancer, a shame that she barely got any screentime
=
1:35 you see another mamamoo member very focus
=
Damn it...they are so good in this concert I can't move on❤
=
Omg can we talk abou yuqi and shuhua! MY HEART!!!
=
iM STILL SO PISSED OFF THEY GOT LAST PLACE LIKE HOW no hate to lovelyz i think their performance was v gud but personally i think they and gidle should have been switched

ALTHOUGH YUQI'S VOICE IS SO POWERFUL, SHE KILLED DARAS PART WHICH EVERY IDOLS STRUGGLE TO SING,
=
Its my 10th time repeating to this performance. Its so addicting. Their charisma,their vocal, their performance are on another level. I really really love this
=

Btw Minnie really suits this 
=
11.716 
12M is coming  and congrats idle for #1 in brand reputation

Yep, this presentation had the last place ... Amazing ._.
=
Thank you everyone for focusing on Idle instead of ur faves idle is currently the most popular group in korea rn,the more you hate them the more theyll rise
=
G idle are super talented this fire cover is amazing 
For God's sake and words are missing to describe how amazing that presentation was 
They reminded me of the great talent of 2ne1 ❤️
When I hear them, my body shivers 
=
11.7m no stop replay
=
Miyeon so beautiful
=
Omooo  i miss 2ne1 
=
3:56 
=
Honestly I was shocked at them placing last cmon they deserve another win its hard enough to cover such a popular song by 2ne1 as the song aldy has a special place in the audiences hearts
=
why am I crying
=
Ready for the most views in queendom
=
Shuhua’s really beautiful though
=
Legends
=
Minnie
=
is it just me or yuqi reminds me of yuto? (from pentagon)
=
Good stage!!!!

=
Blackjacks: *OMO! I MISS 2NE1! GIDLE IS DOING GREAT! I LOVE THEM!*
Other Random: *Wtf! This is the worst! They don't know how to cover 2NE1*
=
Honestly, this is one of the best covers of all time, they slayed. Soyeon's charisma, Soojin's sexiness, Miyeon slaying her vocals, Yuqi being the baby she is, Minnie having the most iconic line, and Shuhua having REAL LINES. And the most important, they all looked like they were having fun, and that's a very hard thing for rookies, and Bom got boosebumps, you know what I mean, right? Seeing them perform the song of her debut made her cry. (G)I-DLE will be one of the biggest GG for sure. Soyeon wasn't wrong when she said "we are the best of this generation, no one can stop us"
=
I bet Yuqi is sweating cuz she’s wearing long sleeves and there is fire
=
it looks like bom miss thier group in the old times
=
Fandom: Neverland
Fans: Nevies
Haters: Hookers.
Spread the word.(Got it from BTB IDLE)
=
even blackpink didnt dare covering this song! i knew it! i am seeing CL in Soyeon ever since... after this.... Its verified!! hands up! Awwww! Yuqi!! krungyyyyyy!
=
Most viewed Queendom performance. 11M and counting. (G)i-dle does that    #blackjacks
Correct me if I’m wrong.
Views Update: 12M. 
=
I wish if there were fancams for this epic cover...girls you did great job .. Proud.
=
これらの女の子は最高です
=
SOYEON❤
=
12m coming
=
4:03 That’s gay panic right there
=
450k for 12m GO NEVERLAND TOMORROW
=
I watched it countless times but I can't believe it was only in 6th rank
=
Let's go
=
Everything is on point  So much talent right there
=
Gran cover, lo hicieron genial!!! es una canción icónica y supieron hacerla brillar igual de 2en1 <3 me hicieron recordar buenos tiempos y cantar con ellas
=
Hermosas mis niñas !!!!❤❤❤
=
4:12
=
雨琦太绝啦！！！米妮太️啦！！！
=
4:04
=
It showed here that 2ne1 is still alive and inspired other korean girl groups
=
OMG soo good
=
Shuhua dance !!!!!!!!! She has improved so much that it’s scary and makes me excited for the next comeback
=
3:40
=
The vi*ws are frozen ... THE POWER IT'S LIKE A COMEBACK
=
Who thinks CL must been  here..  I think she will cry
=
Burn stage queens
=
SOYEON AND CL NEEDS A COLLAB. LIKE, RIGHT NOW !
=
Sorry but cultural appropriation has a really hazy line, because in that case nobody should rap cause it was invented by black people in the US, nobody should use the piano cause it was used in classical music by Europeans, nobody should use the drums cause it was used by many different cultures around the world to dance. People need to know the difference between inspiration and disrespect. They were not doing a parody or mocking a culture, they were dancing and getting inspired by other cultures to do their performance which in fact shows how much they respect them or they wouldn't be using it in something so serious for them. For this reason stan talent, stan gidle.
=
I'm a Blackjack and I'm so impressed with G-Idle's version. They gave justice to the song!!! Cube better not sh*t on these girls, they're so precious.
=
Why no one talking about Yuqi ? She looks like freaking Anabelle doll.
=
am i the only one who want them to perform this song in an award show along with Lion, please babies please even for once
Edit: thanks for the likes :*
=
minnie looks like the little girl who killed kids in corpse party
=
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT SEO SOOJIN?! THE WAY SHE TOOK OF HER LIPSTICK, SOOJIN BABY U DESERVE MORE
=
Why did Soyeon’s smile at the very end actually scare me-
=
i don’t care what anyone says, no girl group has EVER moved me like this. this stage is perfect, the way the emotion poured out of the girls!! i’m so proud!
02:34 will go down in history.
=
Okay so no ones is actually going to mention Soojin's expressions as well? She's literally crying on the stage LIKE DAMN GURL I FELT THAT
=
Maybe you DIDN’T NOTICE:
 Background was a tidal wave (wave of emotions).
 All six of them are wearing a ring on their ring finger (copule or engagement ring).
 They red grown was like it was stained by blood: Passion, Love, Anger.
 Female backup dancers and the man at the beginning have an ❌ on their mouth.
 At 3:03 the backup dancers are dragged off the stage.
  Soyeon “are you going to leave me?” represents a mad/ possessive girl who is broken but doesn’t want her loved to go.
 The contortionist made a heart shaped (distorted) monster form but it later broke off.
Thanks to the girl who found out all those particulars!
=
Will never get tired of Minnie's facial reaction. She's like someone from the horror film who got killed by the man she loves the most. You can see and feel the pain and wrath esp in her eyes.
=
4:06... Minnie what the f...her eyes gave me chills.. I replayed that part for 7 times
=
The way she took of her lipstick...... I won't be able to get over it for a while
=
No one talk about my soyeon slaying her rapping and her expressions.
=
Just my opinion, from the sadness on there face:
Shuahua: i'm still hoping, we can fix this, be toghether one more time.
Miyeon: that's enough! No more sadness, no more pain! I'll be stronger.
Yuqi: being abused every single day...What must i do? Am i losing my mind..?
Soojin: NO! This isn't you! PLEASE! Comeback to be the man you was! I cant take this anymore..
Minnie: nothing important anymore. I'm going to end my life.
Soyeon:*LAUGH*...*Cry*...*LaUgH*...
=
Minnie's expressions are no joke
=
Still wondering why gidle not perform this masterpiece in MAMA or MMA.. they are bot even invited to perform.. duh
=
if no one is going to talk about soojin’s part then i am. girl she ruled this performance. the way the music was glitching during her part and her facial expression as she cried and wiped her eyes. man that shit looked so real it really hit me
=
People are talking about Soojin just wiping off her lipstick but it's so much more than that. It's the connection she made with the audience and the emotion she poured out into it.
=
Who Love Minnie?


=
Can't get over of Soyeon's face cause she's really like getting mad (crazy) and also Soojin's facial expression when she removed her lipstick, I can feel the pain through her eyes
=
Why is no one talking about yuqi in 1:42 like the smirk smile at the end is sending me creepy vibes
=
Minnie's gaze, dayum, it's going straight thru my soul
=
Isn’t it cool that their entertainment promotes each member equally , AND HOW (G)I-DLE showcases their talents  and personalities. Bruuuhhh, no one can conquer them . 
Miyeon & Soyeon- KDA
Yuqi- Running Man China
Soojin & Shuhua-Solo Dance Performance at Queendom
Minnie-  Solo Debut- Empire
=
I dont get how they didnt win 1st. Like they put so much emotion and it was bone chilling how real it felt. The other groups were good but this was something so different. You feel the pain and heartbreak and inner turmoil and (G)Idle were such amazing actresses
=
Everyone’s expressions are so beautiful but I think we should all focus on Minnie’s! I mean! She did phenomenal. You didn’t only say just the pain and sadness but anger. I’m in awe
=
when u realize in the time slot the other groups had to just practice their performance, gidle had to remix the entire song, add a rap and other parts to turn the song from a ballad to having a dance appropriate flow, have someone make choreography from scratch for the remixed song and then learn it just for this stage. Imagine how little time they had to actually practice the performance itself, yet it turned out so perfect with each member overflowing with stage presence and perfectly in sync with eachother. 

They are monsters.
=
Yuqi and Minnie literally walked out of a horror film
=
this is so impressive. these girls are no joke
=
This and their LION performances are enough to win over any year-end performances if they ever perform them
=
Shuhua and Miyeon looks like those crying wife ghosts to me-
Yuqi looks inSaNe.
Soojin's small actions give me the chills, like when she smeared her lipstick
Soyeon's smile at the end—
And omg Minnie scared me the most-
they are qu E e n.s
=
This is the only performance where I didn't see Yuqi's adorable face
=
Even I can't believe they didn't win, it's okay. This show letting people know how talented and hardworking they are. I think (G)I-dle will be more successful because of that reason. They have a lot of new fans. They got the viewer's heart.
=
They really enjoy every moment on stage,  not acting.
=
Cube's artists are ALWAYS ALWAYS deserve a lot more than this.
=
I think they channeled horror female themes such as fatal attraction, grudge, ringu, obsessed jealous lover. The body contortions king of look like a heart which they drew while preparing for the song. This performance should've take 1st place because the song and performance jelled so well.
=
i love minnie's expression so much i had to stop for a bit at 4:07
just look at her
=
That blonde girl’s smile in the very last part scares me fr. She killed that performance 
=
Miyeon's visuals
Minnie's vocal
Soojin's lips and more
Soyeon's rap
Yuqi's voice
Shuhua's charm
It's so amazing and perfect❤️
=
HUGE respect to all the other girl groups but G-IDLE RAN QUEENDOM their performances are so powerful
=
4:34 Hwasa was like: "Damn, they are strong contenders"
=
I cried seeing soojin's expression. Too breathtaking.
=
I can see the pain and anger from Minnie's eyes. It's like she got killed by her boyfriend. It's sad but scary. 
=
Their stage presence is getting better and thats crazy
=
This performance is the very OPPOSITE of typical girl group performance imo
=
4:06 her facial expression there is so good. She truly looks like she have been hurt, and the painful look in her eyes that shows that she's broken and cant move on.
=
Soyeon looks like a person who is obsessed with their S.O. but went insane after parting with them. Who ends up killing their S.O. 
(I LOOOVE how her character gradually falls into insanity in this performance. At first she looks like she doesn't want to believe that her lover left her and that she was in so much pain. The frequency sound plus the way she grabs her hair while covering her ears was like how I was before when my hallucinations started. She looks like she was hearing voices but desperately clings to her sanity. But in rap part kinda shows how she was slowly giving into the suggestive voices in her head as she slowly falls into an endless pit of rage and pain. If she ever kills her lover, I'm very sure it's at this part. Lastly, with her psychotic smile at the end shows how she finally let go of her sanity and completely went bonkers after killing her lover. She totally looks like a person who'd say this "If I can't have you, you're better off dead." Our baby is a total yandere lol)
Soojin is like a person who was betrayed by her lover by killing her loved ones or family.
(Our baby was on the brink of crying on stage. The look of disbelief she has at her first appearance in this vid combined with the expression she had when she removed her lipstick litterally moves me to tears. Dang she was the embodiment of pain in this vid.)
Minnie is like a woman who was killed by her own lover but somehow miraculously survived/she died and is now a vengeful ghost.
(No need to explain with this one. Can't get enough of her facial expressions. There's so much hate and pain in her eyes that I can't help but feel chills when she looks at the camera. If soojin was the embodiment of pain then our baby minnie is basically hate itself)
Shuhua and Miyeon looks like a woman who was used by their lover for something like inheritance cause of being heiresses of some bigshots (lol)
[Their lack of expressions (in comparison with other g-idle members) for me looks like they're holding back the tears cause they have too much pride hence the heiress thingy background]
Yuqi looks like a woman who was cheated on by her partner for a long time with her bestfriend/sister so she formed an impenetratable wall in her heart and is now a sarcastic/mocking/passive-aggressive person.
(She looks like she was in so much pain. She looks like she was suffering so much. The smirk she has on 1:43 shows how the betrayal affected her as a person hence, becoming a passive-aggressive/sarcastic person. Her bangs covers her eyes a lot in this vid so we see how unattached she may seem to others but the occassional times we see her eyes we can see how much pain she was hiding and how she was suffering tremendously inside.)
=
All of Idle performances reached 10M except this one, let's steam it to 10M because this performance deserves it
=
minnie make up is iconic the moment this video drop
=
this was actually rlly scary. soyeon’s smile at the end was creepy ;--;
=
That moment when Soojin takes off her lips. Find me in the heaven
=
I don't care if they didn't win, they're the best of their generation, Soyeon said it and she's quite right. I'm not a big fan of k-pop, but thanks to this group I've been feeling like when I was listening to BIG BANG as a child.
I love these girls and I love all their performance, they are the winners of my heart. My Queens like a lion.
=
Let's just take a moment and appriciate soojin's acts
=
THEY NEED TO PERFORM IN MAMA 2019 
=
those 2.8k people who disliked the video just simply couldn’t handle the professionalism and talent in this video
=
To be honest all gidle performances in this queendom is amazing is versatile that name performance with strong concept
=
Still cant move on with their performance lol i became their fans after watch queendom hahah
=
I really had to watch Soojin rub off her lipstick like 12 times
=
I hate when people say "wHy nOoNe TaLkS aBoUt 'idol's name'?" 
It's annoying af.
=
I swear... i can’t imagine queendom without them....they put a whole lot to the table THEY’RE SOOO GOOODDD UGHHH
=
Wooooooooooow. This is one of the best performances I've ever seen from a girl group in my almost 12 years in kpop. I was tense the entire time. This was riveting. All the girls did amazing. Soojin is meant for the stage. That part where she's shaking while rubbing off her lipstick.....chills
=
I can't be the only one who was like *"dude. this is scary"* in the beginning-
=
1:44 THAT SMIRK THO
=
i actually cried watching this, felt the pain that they were expressing
=
I'm watching this like its a part of a theatrical horror play. These girls know how to perform. Not just dance & sing but perform
=
*When it said "Nightmare Ver." I didn't took it seriously. But now I legit got nightmares every night. They're so amazing. Soyeon really didn't lie when she said they're the best of this generation*
=
i have never seen any girl kpop that dare to mess up their make up during perfom so daring !!!( if have then theyt are also daring)
=
they are AMAZING 
=
The other groups were always so surprised with what G IDLE came with.....
=
This. is PURE. TALENT. They are incredible. No one's doing it like them. Legendary performance. Perfect in all aspects
=
how many of yall noticed when during soyeons rap the background dancers dragged the other background dancers away
=
I never realized how pretty Yuqi looks with baby blue eyes
=
All their other 3 performances have surpassed 10m, let's get this one there too!!!
=
Knetizens were to scared by this performance 
While International fans loved it
=
2:31 This part alone deserves an Oscar.
=
SOOJIN you are a LEGEND
=
This is great...think this is my fav girl kpop idol group...the stage presence...
=
Mimi was scared by idle's performance, but I was scared by her make up 
=
SOYEON'S VERSE IS PERFECTION. the emotion, the intensity, i can't breathe
=
Saudades deve ser menina talentosa amo muito elas sinto falta dessas meninas lindas g idle
=
I have no cometsthis is a real talent
=
Dude they scared everyone
=
Neverland we need more 2.9m to reach 10m views. gogogogogo(sorry bad english?)
=
I  think its the best kpop nightmare song with scary dance
=
*G-DLE*
   *❤*
=
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT YUQI?? SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL IN EVERY SCENE SHE WAS AT
1:35 - GAVE ME CHILLS
3:39 - SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE CAME FROM HEAVEN
=
real artists
=
soojins acting is actually crazy i literally teared up wtf???
=
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS ACK—
THEY'RE ALL SOOOOOOOO GOOD. YOU CAN REALLY SEE AND FEEL THE EMOTIONS. SALUTE TO THIS GIRLS!!
I JINJJA LOVE THEM ❤️
=
Minnie could def be in dreamcatcher with those expressions damn
=
I just noticed Yuqi's smirk at 1:44. I got chills damn it
=
This performance is the best in queendom, I know other performances is good too, but I can watch it many times of one day, every time I watch it, I can discover something new. Too many details in this performance.
=
y`all stan this quuens! i repeat you all stan this queens
=
Say what you want about idle but their stage presence is INSANE
=
Their reaction is me
=
omgg all of gidle's queendom performances are legendary im shoook
=
To me , this was THE performance of Queendom.....Lion was also great, but this one to me deserves as much praise
=
God... nothing describes a perfect performance better than this. The emotions, the charisma, the perfection in timing and vocals, the meaning... This is power.
=
after watching lion i feel like this is the moment when they scatered into pieces before they found some sterngth to rise as a queen
=
Soyeon's smile in the end gave me the chills--- I love this song so much. Another reason for me to love this group. 
=
g idle will be queen of k pop in coming era
neverland will always support them
=
I wish there is a better word then "Impressed" because I really am. But one thing I want to say is I really love it. (G)I-dle gotta build their own name in music industry someday. Believe me.
=
Outstanding performance !! Love from Nashville, Tennessee USA
=
CHRISTLER THEIR EXPRESSIONS, also the lipstick smear is EXTREME GENIUS. They really made their makeup part of the choreo
=
what an underrated performance. 10/10 in my book
=
Simon cowell be looking at performances like this and trying to figure out how to achieve such perfection
Good luck to him
=
Everyone had such killer parts where they shined individually omg
Soyeon: Her evil smile at the end with the chilling lyrics
Shuhua: Her hair flip before Minnie’s ‘Appa aiya’ 
Miyeon: Her phrase at the beginning when she looks down at the floor starting the ‘hurt and mad’ feeling.
Yuqi: Looking straight in the camera looking like a abused doll with the mad expression 
Soojin: Facial expression as she smeared her lipstick.
Minnie: Eyes. Omg.
=
2:30 i dont know but i havent seen anyone remove lipstick as effortlessly as soojin did.
=
minnie’s eyes omfg I love them so much they’re so powerful
=
I love it and i love (G)I-DLE the group is unique ❤
=
And it was in this video that I was seduced by minnie
=
I can't with solar's facial expression
=
What a stage presence!!! If they are this FINE now, just imagine what will they do after few years (if they don't disband).....
=
when Mnet cameras cannot get 1 silly reaction from AOA in 5 minutes...you know this was deep....

PEACE!❣❣
=
This is from a month ago and I still watch it everyday it’s so good

تفسير الغنية:
 النظرية: الأغنية تدور حول امرأة توقف زوجها عن حبها ، فقتلته.  
شوهوا وميون: إنهم يمثلون إنكار أنه لا يحبها.  وجوههم لها نظرة فارغة ، لأنها لا تريد أن تصدق ما فعلوه أو أنه لم يحبها.  
يوكي وسوجين: يمثلان الألم الذي تشعر به ، قبل وبعد أن تصبح مجنونة.  Yuqi في البداية تبدو حزينة ولكن متحمس أيضا أنها ستقتله.  تبدو Soojin حزينة حتى تلطخ أحمر الشفاه ، عندما تلطخ عصا الشفاه ، فإنها ترمز إلى فرك دم يديها.  لم تعد حزينة أو غاضبة فحسب ، فهي خائفة مما أصبحت عليه.  وبعد تلطخ أحمر الشفاه لم يعد يوكي يبدو متحمسًا ، يبدو أنها مرعوبة تمامًا مثل سووجين.  (عندما تلطخ سوجين عصا شفتها عندها تقتل الزوج.) 
ميني: إنها تمثل المرأة لا تشعر بأي شيء.  العاطفة الوحيدة التي تظهرها هي الألم الشديد ، لكنها لا تبكي.  إنها علامة حقيقية على الجنون.  
صويون: في البداية كانت حزينة وفي حالة إنكار ، لكنها في النهاية كانت مجنونة تمامًا إلى درجة أنها كانت تبتسم تمامًا ثانية واحدة لتبكي بصوت عالٍ على الأرض.  من بين جميع الفتيات تمثل الغضب الحقيقي والمجنون في المرأة.  مزاجها التحولات أكثر من غيرها.  في النهاية ، يغني الجميع أغنيات مختلفة وهي فوضوية بعض الشيء.  انها مثل رأسها مليء بالأصوات والمشاعر.  هي مجنون تماما.  
هذه قطعة فنية حقيقية.❤❤❤❤لقد أبدعوا❤❤❤❤
=
anyone going to talk about wheein hiding behind her hands?  3:16  
=
I LOVE IT
The facial expressions are so real, the movements... it's like they are really suffering.
I'm so proud of them, this group deserve much more.
=
3:07 always me
=
solar's reaction
=
Soojin's expressions literally make me want to fight whoever hurt her! Thats how good she is!
=
I legit cried to this. I can't imagine people sleeping on this
=
1:15 Miyeon's voice breaking is breaking my heart..
=
I could never take my eyes off them. Even now I am shocked. Their stage presence and charisma is not a joke.
=
THIS IS *MASTERPIECE* AND YOU CAN'T CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE!
=
why does yuqi look like someone froman anime horror movie
=
Like I'm still not over this masterpiece, MINNIE tho 
=
How they performed the song with such an amazing feelings make me wanna cry they are a really really great and an excellent girl group 
=
But damn these girls tho!
=
the best stage ive ever seen in my 
life
=
This is a great song. It's cool to see them perform a nightmare version of it on Queendom. An amazing performance.
=
Omg, I'm so amazed with every gidle performance in this program.
=
Their reaction was like they are watching the most scariest horror movie
=
From Sean and breaking down the k vid.
=
They're SO TALENTED
=
2:31-2:35 this part made me cry.
=
WAIT I DIDN'T KNOW THIS GRUP IS THIS SICKENING
=
Even though it’s like a horror movie but a captivating performance not only they sing, dance, and act
=
Son minnie is fucking amazing i love that scary look her facial expression was on point and soojin baby girl who hurt you she did so well
=
I can't believe they didn't win. In this moments is when I realize how fixed Mnet is.

=

=
One of G-idle's iconic performance  that I have ever seen! I'm so proud of G-Idle they slay ❤❤
=
I get so into the performance but then Yong's face at 1:16 cracks me up every time
=
Idle set the standard!
=
They got the higher viewers on each videos *handclaps
=
THIS IS MASTERPIECE. THIS IS A TOP CONCEPT ART.
=
i cant believe that, that amazing. 
=
I watched this so many times
=
although this is a nightmare ver, i cried bcs of the emotions they brought out. esp soojin's part while removing the lipstick.
=
Wow, they're really amazing how come the didn't win?!
=
I CANT BELIEVE SOOJIN COULD BE THIS DRAMATIC IM SO SO LOVING IT
=
NO ME CANSO DE VER ESTA PRESENTACION ,ES TAN UNICA ,LO AMO❤ ES LO MEJOR PRESENCIA ESCENICA QUE HE VISTO EN UN GRUPO DE CHICAS !!!
=
SOOJIN SMUDGING HER LIPSTICK HIT ME HARD DAMN
=
MINNIE KILLING MEEE YOUR EYES OMG
=
1:57 esta parte me pone la piel de gallina  
=
Best minnie♥️
=
Minnie and soojin should be casted for a horror drama...
=
The amazing performance i,never,see before❤stan my queen❤✨
=
Haters! Bark loudly I can’t hear u!!! The louder u are the more popular idle is. It’s not your turn to judge but keep your intentions so that idle be raising fast than before.
=
I always liked this group, but this performance and song has stolen my soul. I am now a massive stan of this crazy talented group! ❤️
=
well, soojin just killed me!
THOSE ACTINGS!
=
Beautiful presentation
they are great ❤️
¡¡(G)i-dle!!
=
Why I feel their message..this was the best stage I've ever seen in kpop girlgroup.
 SOOYEON RAP WAS THE CRAZIEST!!!!
=
As a Miracle (and Elvis - poor AOA) g-idle should’ve gotten first for this, it was amazing
=
3:07
the boys wow so fabulous...how they doit that?? wow so fabulous..
=
A concept I never knew I wanted.  (┬┬﹏┬┬)
=
My Queens ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
This is y I loved them when they debuted. 
They r unique & music is good.
=
Imagine they preform this on MAMA2019 
=
Please perform this performance again on another award show. I really want to know how other groups/artist react to this crazy performance 
=
I'm crying, sweating and getting goosebumbs. Amazing.
=
Goosebumps 
=
All of them did so well but I will go with yugi in this song and choreography she was awesome ..
=
if you wondering who’s agust d’s sister, come here look at soyeon, she’s agust d’s sister
=
The facial expressions- the dance- IM *SHOOK*
=
This performance is so crazy. They are really good with their facial expression especially Soojin, Yugi and Soyeon
=
I LOVE MY GIRLS SO MUCH 
=
well this vid reaches to the point where even I randomly screenshot a part then it can go viral . They're just too good
=
Idk why but this song makes me feel sad while watching this scary(amazing) performance again n again
=
why is no one talking about yuqi. y’all see that bro! soojin, minnie, and yuqi definitely owned this stage.
=
when Lion era came... but you havent moved on to say no nightmare ver.
=
omg soyeon your talent is no joke
=
After artbeat cover :)
=
I'm so drown with their emotions
=
Soojin ❤️
=
Creepy but addictive. I can't stop playing this song again and again
=
I want another performance like this from them, this has made me a Stan, I’m officially a g-idle fan now ☺️
=
IT'S SO HURT ANYMORE.CRAZYYYYY
=
Legendary 
=
That Yuqi's smirk was just aaaaa
=
M not a g-idle fan but I can't stop watching this performance  
=
Performing live on stage as a rookie is not easy ..since their debut last year they have been performing in some award show and based on all I see they are already unleased out of their comfort zone compared to previous mma and gda performance competing and performing better than even the senior artist ..damn they are talented..
=
OH MY GOOD! I'ts so epic, i never seen this in K-pop
I love G-idle! I love You! Thanks for this epic perfomance 
No sé mucho escribir inglés, aguante G-idle, saludos de Chile , son grandiosas, sigan así 
=
Perfect girls 
=
10M with this one COME ON
=
Why am I watching this at the midnight I am so scared.help.
=
4:32 she's cute 
=
I love their stage presence
=
im a international fans, i cant keeping myself watching this video as it is a masterpieces of arts. comparing with others girl groups  i think these girls are the best
=
My favourite performance from this episode... and one of best performance on this show.
=
is there no one talk abt soyeon's smirk?  she has that horror vibe but i like it
=
Omg i love this song❤ ! !
=
Define ARTIST
=
Great performance. Too bad it was eclipsed by Lion, another great performance, because of timing of finals.
=
If could I would want them to perform this whole piece of art of 5:01 min on the stage of MAMA my lord I love it
=
Solar at every performance be like:
️️
     
=
This is amazing!
=
Minnie!!!
=
I just keep coming back to watch this epic performance (and Soojin’ s Senorita fancam!)
What should I do omg NEVERLAND(G)I-DLE
=
THE FACT GIDLE IS IN ANOTHER LEVEL FROM THE OTHER. GIDLE IS REALLY AMAZING
=
This group will shine more in the future. 
=
These girls know how to perform so much emotion just wow
=
3:06 lmao
=
I m sorry that I get chills watching this performance. One of the legendary performance. If this performance is in award show, it will be epic as well. I feel bad about the fact this performance didn't win but I know it has won hearts of neverland❤
=
i really like yuqi voice at 3:39 and the end 3:49 i really love she voice  idk why that part give me goosebumps ;–; 
=
The one who take off her lipstick make me want to stand her. Every performance give me unique feeling.
=
This is my favorite video awesome
=
2:50, iconic.
=
That lipstick smearing, I cant even... soojin you're killing us 
=
they are something else.
=
watched this countless number of times already, still getting the goosebumps all over...
=
bless mnet! bless queendom! its like im watching mama!!!
=
3:38 Yuqi looks like a yandere there
=
I'm so in love with this song and the dance routine that I can't even talk about it..
=
Loving Minnie's dead eyes 
=
Why MAMA didnt perform this epic stage?
=
they are not idol, they are the TRUE ARTIST
=
The lipstick part omg Soojin!
=
Let's be real. (G)I-dle really put their effort in every performance here. Their dedication is amazing.
=
2:31 soojin just killed me
=
Im here from sean Video breaking it down !
=
G idle always showed a strong performance 
=
I hope they will perform it on award shows tbh i can’t wait to see the reactions of my favs
=
Omg not sure if it’s due to speechless or what but Hwasa from Mamamoo, please show some reaction. Any reaction at all! 
=
In a competition not everyone can get first place. I’d still say the winners were deserved that’s not to put anyone down every group brought their A game.
=
They all amazing
=
Minnie with her bangs makes her look more badass and sophisticated. How can someone be so cute and badass at the same time. Minnie's visuals are no joke. She stole the show. Applause.
=
Soyeon at 4:47 is so scaryyyy she gave me goosebumps and I'm watching this at 12:35 in the midnight gosh.
=
Amazing (G)I-DLE
=
Please teach me everything about G idle
=
4:06 n 4:31
Just in case u guys want to feel haunted..
=
Perfect perfect perfect
=
พี่มินนี่คือดีไม่ไหวแล้ว❤
=
The harmony at the end was perfection! This is one of the best stages gidle performed so far. Just makes you wonder what more they can do. 4:03 also gave me goosebumps and yuqi and soyeon's smirk was eerily creepy. Never seen much girl groups do this horror concept but gidle nailed it! I am still amazed by this performance. The hair the dress the *lipstick smudge* and all was breathtaking. More people started to stan gidle from queendom and I'm so proud their talent is being recognised! I hope they continue with success in the future! Lion came out recently (as of this comment) and l suggest you check it out too because it's a bop. Gidle slayed this and I hope they come up with hits in the future!
=
One day they'll be veryyy BIG. No doubt in that they're complete package as a Group ❤. Their vocals is not a joke esp their talents. Keeep shining G-IDLE
=
Like her psychopathic smile #Yugi
@1:43
=
1:26 love that look!!
=
DAMN GOOD✨
=
1:50 I love this part so much 
=
1:51 My baby Shuhua what are you doing?
=
Wow. Just WOW. Gidle.. I'm freaking love you guys
=
this stage was really amazing!!!!!!the vibe of this song,they  performed it so well❤️
=
soyeon's vocals
=
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ MIYEON TE AMO.❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
2:31 will forever be iconic like just- AGH
=
The best live girl group performance in history of kpop
=
Best k pop girls group ❤
=
2:30
Soojin is crying..so sad this song..and so scary..but i'm not scary...
=
They came with this and then Lion... Awesome.
=
2:30 , Oooooh Soojin , a I'm so sad, she is a amazing actress
=
2:32 honestly just give soojin an acting role already
=
MINNIE IS PHENOMENAL. ALSO EVERYONE!
=
Someone give them an oscar
=
Omg...they are women in red!!
=
The way Soojin's eyes got teary, her lips trembled, and let out a deep breath as she wiped her lipstick truly portrait a desperate and deeply hurt person. Everything about it was perfect I keep replaying it!
=
Minne was fascinating!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Why is no one talking about Yuqi????????????
=
This should be No.1 !!!

=
This is magnificent!
=
Soyeon rapp is deep and i can feel the emotion in it..
=
Finally they sing this song in stage! For me, that's really great performance!
=
We got so many webtoons make into movie. Can we get this song too?? The story line and concept are insanely great.
=
Minnie est juste extraordinaire !!! Superbe performance

=
Lion was a great performance, but I feel like this performance is the one ....this is truely different.
=
SOOOOJINNN

=
i’m a moomoo but i still cant get over this performance. it gave me goosebumps, mixed feelings, captivated, and hooked. safe to say that i’m starting to listen to (g)i-dle now and i’m in love
=
Soojin's eyes - Let me out
Minnie's eyes - I'm dead inside
Soyeon's eyes - Psycho
Yuqi's eyes - I'm tired
Miyeon's eyes - I'm used to it
Shuhua's eyes - I'm still trying
=
This is amazing 
=
Hwasa lookin like she's ready to throw hands at anyone who comes near her just sends every goddamn time

Soojin, Minnie & Soyeon know how to portray different emotions through their faces, body's and expressions perfectly. 
Hands up for Yuqi, Shuhua & Miyeon too cause they did their best and still killed it!♡

=
funny how idle performance are always trending and getting the most views but still not getting 1st. dont talk about being overrated bc idle arent overrated and their perf are always a high quality content that people can appreciate.
Edit: im not saying mamamoo didnt deserved the title goddamit
=
soyeon is so creative omg
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
the spotify song version lacks the iconic charisma they displayed here.. That stage presence and acting, really makes me wanna cry
=
Okay this is perfect
=
I like mamamoo but (g)idle needed to win these girls worked harder than mamamoo but I like mamamoo too
But (g)idle deserved to win
=
It should be reperformanced at MAMA 2019 
=
OMG SOOJIN 
=
Saranghae Idle <3<3<3<3<3<3

OMGGGGGGGGGGG SHUHUAAAAAAAAA
=
Woow... ❤
=
2:33
=
soojin's lipstick smearing never fails to give me goosebumps fr
=
Until now i still wonder how can they didn't win :(
=
They all have amazing acting skills , they all looked angry, sad and  devastated throughout the whole thing!!! What the heck is Mnet and live voter's problem ?!
=
I love how they also got some backup dancers here that are very talented too!
=
One word to describe their performance: Wowwww
=
Lol i love the réaction of other participants ❤️
=
Queens 
❤️❤️
=
4:47 THAT SMILE...
=
I got goosebump from the beginning till the end  (G)I-DLE is my queen!!

=
Pero me encanto pero me encanto un monton! Increible presentacion
=
ใครคนไทยแสดงตัวหน่อย☺
=
Damnn bagus puolll
=
So um...where’s their Oscar?
=
its like every girl had her own somethings painful inside but we all feel terrifying about it
=
2:29
=
The performance is REALLY amazing beyond words. I never expect those girls would make a real PERFORMANCE on the stage but they did. One of those looks like an abandoned and broken doll seeking revenge in desperation :0  And incidentally I would say they do have a very dramatic and ambitious goal if they generated such idea completely by themselves
=
Still gives me chills .. no one can do it like them
=
Who hurt you soyeon?
=
i thought the song title was nightmare lol
=
3:38
=
Literally not one person has mentioned Yuqi
=
yo that like hybrid chorus got me shook
=
素晴らしい
=
This is the first female band that really made me a fan ever since 2ne1.  Well mainly Soyeon that really caught my attention. Same thing as CL that caught my attention to made me fell in love with 2ne1.
=
#streamlion

=
I need (G)IDLE x VIXX they're both concept kings
=
Soojin!! You've killed me!!!!!!
=
2:44
=
03:35
=
Ok there's actually a plot line going on throughout the stage. I saw this in one of the comments from the full version vid and I think it's pretty interesting so I'm just leaving a comment here so more people can see it.
 
*In the very beginning,  you can see some police lines that says 'you dare' on them (i guess it indicates a crime scene,  probably murder).

*The line goes, "say that you hate me, try saying that you don't love me," but the guy's mouth is shut with tape so he's not able to say anything.
*Right at the moment the light turns red, there's a metal sound(probably a knife) and the guy bends down as if he's dead.

*All of them have rings on their left ring fingers and their outfit represents a wedding dress, except it's completely stained in blood. Some Korean fans believe all 6 members represent different characters of one woman, who just murdered her fiance cuz he said "no" to her.

*Right at the moment Soyeon's rap part ends, you can see the backup dancers dragging other dancers out of the stage on the floor, which means dragging out the dead body.
*Soyeon's last line of her rap part goes, "You'll end up like this if you leave me." Right after that, the dancers and their movements, which probably would've freaked you guys out, represent the stages the body goes through after death, such as stiffness and flaccidity of muscles and limbs.

*Along with the choreo and the overall tone of the music, Soyeon's expression changes throughout the performance. She closes her eyes and trembles in rage in the very beginning. During her rapping, she goes crazy and spits out words like a mad person. But at the end, her facial expressions and how she walks make it seem like she's almost out of her mind. At the very last moment, she smiles as if she finally went insane after killing her fiance.
*One more interesting thing I found. The last line in the original version goes, "Just say yes. No, I mean tell me you're in love. Just like the good times. Now, can't you love me?" but this time it goes, "Just say yes. Yes, keep saying that. Just like the good times. Just like you'd love me now." I feel like she's saying that to the body of her lover, whom can't say anything anymore cuz of course, he's dead. It just shows that she's completely out of her mind.

Thanks for reading such a long comment :)
=
She is wearing a bloody wedding dress.
That means she killed her fiancée, who had said goodbye because he no longer loved her.
=
my theory is a woman slowly turning insane as her lover left her.
let me explain..

So at the very beginning, we see a man with his mouth tied shut. After a while, the man drops dead and everything goes red. We know that this man is killed because of the knife sound, the girl killing him. 
Then, we see Soyeon singing. She's sitting down on the ground, and her face looks blank, no expression at all. It looks like she is in pain or/and quite sad. After she grabs her hair she looks up back to the camera very quickly, before looking back down again. But when she looks down, she looks kind of disappointed. This part shows how the woman is actually turning insane very slowly but quickly at the same time.
Now, after that scene Soojin appears. If you look on her hand, she raises it to her stomach. She raised it up to show the camera the engagement ring. The woman and the man were about to get married, before the man unexpectedly broke up with her. 
You can also see all the members slowly going insane by the end. Messy hair, smeared make-up, very disturbed facial expressions. During Soyeons rap, she smiles every now and then. Just kind of randomly. She kind of screams the rap, and, at the end she looks into the camera with a very angry face. But why is she smi- LMAO NO SHES INSANE NOW 
You can also look at the way they are dressed. Red dresses. Do you know what red means? Blood.
4:27 you can also see them putting their hands on their heads like they have a headache or/and stressed. Like they are so in shock that suddenly they got a headache. 
Then, lastly, at the end Soyeon smiles before everyone sits down on the ground and cry in the rain. This part is right after the murder I'm guessing. Like, they hated the guy for breaking up with her, but she also regrets killing him.
=
they shouldn't include all those reaction from idols honestly it's about the performance not the reaction
=
I really love them so much :'>
And I really don't know why I'm crying here when I'm watching this :'>♡♡
=
i want to watch them perform this song so badly in mama!!

*sorry for my bad english
=
I love Solar’s reaction lol she just looks shook to the core
=
They are legend❤❤
=
This is what i didnt know i needed like this song was my favorite out of the album and i listen to it on a daily and then THIS HAPPENED  AND I AM SHOOKETH
=
LOVE THEM SO MUCH
=
G I-DLE show their pottential....the goal is not be 1 is show that their are in another level
=
I've been waiting so long. Today is  D day. Can't wait for queendom to be over. I want Idle out of this hell hole ASAP.
=
This evoked some kind of emotions in me. This performance is so strong. Maybe I cried. I love these girls so much they're so talented amd creative. They're always surprising me with their capabilities. It's crazy.
=
G Idle always Shuts it down with their live stage performances and vocals and choreography hands down
=
Wow!!!
Parece la presentación ganadora de los MAMA 
HERMOSAS 
=
I NEED TO SEE YUQI AND SOOMIN IN A HORROR MOVIE ♥️
=
this feels like their comebackk.
=
Ddaeng!! This is a real, emotional, and pure piece of arts. That performance so freaking dope af, I'm so speechless.
=
English: Perfection
Korean: (G) I-dle
=
WOW I stan the right girl group 
=
This is so fricken amazing.
=
The best performance ever, this should be winning the show!!
=
Koreans can't enjoy idle's stage
=
This song stuck in my head right now
=
I thought all comments would be about soojin’s performance she did the best especially at 2:31
=
1:44 that's it. I'm gay for yuqi.
=
i stan another group again...
=
Doesn’t matter how many times I watch this performance, I get goosebumps EVERY TIME!
=
Wuuuuaaaaaau :o  me encantooooooo  
=
Daaaaaamn this blew me away holy shi- wait .. WHERE'S MY WIG AGAIN ??! FU- ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
=
Anyone here after the Halloween version just came out? These are my jams!
=

=
ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES EVER!!!

=
7m both and 4th in one week and trending, funny Mnet
=
They are brilliant
=
Yang keren kayak gini pun ga 1st win loh, heran aku tu sama Mnet monyet satu ini 
=
dear mnet I need to see this again at MAMA
=
i love their stage performances..  so different and daebak
=
minnie's facial expression dance move and vocal
=
They should remake their M/V and make this genre performance into their Official M/V.
=
Minnie looks so dead and tired of bullshitty love. Man, she went on a bias wrecking spree since Uh-Oh lol.
=
This is possibly my favorite performance I've ever seen.
=
Can we talk about Minnie's look here. Damn bewitching.
=
I love how Minnie's eye make up accentuated her expressions... anyone who knows how to recreate the look? Gladly appreciate it!
=
I see heartbreaks represented in many ways here: Soyeon turns it into insanity, Soojin into deep sadness, Miyeon into sorrowful contemplation, Yuqi into depression, Minnie into detachement, and Shuhua into blooming rage.
=
MINNIE'S EXPRESSIONS THO HASJIWJXJSJSKKDSKODDJDJEMEJDNDIEJSJDDJJDJWJ IM MALFUNCTIONING
=
30m v*ws for 3 perfomance Mnet and (G)idle 1, 6 and 4 position

La media presentación que hicieron!! 
Yuqi hermosamente tierna 
=
it seems that only girly preformances are popular in korea...thats how oh my girl got 1st in 2 weeks surpassing gidle and mamamoo who did better
=
gidle are still the real winners, they got even more popular and recognized for their versatility.
=
who came here after they posted the dance practice halloween version?
=
To be honest, I really really don’t think oh my girl’s performance is better than g idle’s performance, in whole performances, g idle is the best even though I am not bias 
=
i wonder how they feel being one of the best girl groups of their generation
=
im-
I'm literally shocked now
=
Other idols act so scared while me I was starring blanky at my phone screen I mean it isn't even scary
=
3:05 HAHAHA fue mi cara durante todo el performance xD
=
Soyeon really genius I really want to know how she doing songs like this and reproduce diffrenet verses
=
Best performance ever by a female group!!
=
Holy shit I didn't realise I was drooling lmfao omg but this was really a captivating performance. Keep it up gidle!!

4:04 miyeon vocal is out now...that so amazing...i love this
=
i like how even if this performance rank 4th on the fandora box round(not talking about the whole 3rd round) has the highest views, no each time Gidle performs they go viral on yt, twitter and on korea, they have the highest views on each round whether they ranked the highest or lowest. A controlled crowned would not determine the performance of our girls and just go to say win or not gidle benefitted alot already on queendom like ranking first against BTS on brand ranking.
=
You're the no.1 in my mind！
=
Dang I got hella scared lmao
=
tbh i really like soyeon raps part. the lyrics and emotions. feels like she put so much anger in every word
=
G(idle) deserved a much higher ranking than they’ve been getting. I loved their performances, they were very memorable
=
As expected from my girls❤️❤️
=
Gidle knows how to put up a performance
=
Guys watch nightmare's Halloween version on (G) I-DLE's official youtube channel. It is totally lit and perfect  And let's get this to 5M asap!

=
G-idle may not get the 1st place but they get the viewer’s heart,
=
What's the name of the girl at 04:06? She's so striking!
=
❤️
=
Can somebody cast yuqi in kdrama? Her facial expression is so good and her korean pronunciation sounds like she was born and raised in korea.
=
Legends

=
Does anyone know the story of the song?
=

(G)I-DLE has confirmed that Soyeon will be returning to voice Akali in League of Legends’ upcoming music group, True Damage. Soyeon will be joined by Becky G, Keke Palmer, Jared “Duckwrth” Lee, and Umar “Thutmose” Ibrahim.
Feelinn Exciteddd!!
=
We all know that the queen is G-idle
=
Why is this song so good that I can't even step out from seeing everytime. That emotion, that sadness and the beauty flow of it. Masterpiece!!
=
Brasil?❤
=
Soyeon will be back as Akali in LOL True Damage , Nov. 10......Shes gonna burn down tracks!
=
Pls vote them on AAA 2019. Thank you
=
Their vocals are so damn stable ❤

=
EU OLHEI PRO G IDLE E GRITEI TALENTO

=
Soyeon ft league of legend  coming
=
The concept kind of reminded me just a little bit of The 'Hotel Ceiling' music video by Rixton
=
I love this!
=
すごい好き
=
AMAZING PERFORMANCE!
=
Oh my goodness I don’t want to leave you so dramatic like that scary
=
Akali will make a comeback!!!
=

=
Don't forget to stre** uh oh/ Hann and señorita everyday guys!
Hann is close to hit 100M
=
You really deserves rank #1 
I love you gidle
I love you soo jin
=
When MINNIE appears i was like here the another visual comes
=
แทบัก 
=
To say that this show got attention in the first place bcz of latata stage trending and gaining a lot of attention and look how mnet is treating them. Only (g)i-dle's videos were trending and the most watched too. take that snake.mnet
=
Minnie killed this. 
Her expression is like: 
"I'm going to die from heartbreak, and you are going to die with me. 
Since I can't have you, no one else can."
=
Soojin ruining her lipstick gives me goosebumps omg she made my tears dropped
=
Amazing
=
ชอบมากๆครับ ดูวนไปหลายรอบเลย
=
หลอนอย่างมาก แสดงสีหน้ากันเก่งมากๆ
=
I watched this 4 times straight complete lazer focus like

QUEENS!!!!
QUEEEEEEEENSS!
=

=
Who don't understand the comments like me? 

like:
=
this performance is a masterpiece, i dont know why they have the 4th place
=
This performance was ROBBED  They definitely didn't deserve 4th place
=
it is a cool and memorable performance. When l've seen each member focus cam, It has more impressive detail.
=
they deserved 1st place with this performance, not 4th :(
=
Que talento ♥️
=
This song has always been one of my favourite songs since their first album release. Stream Say No!
=
Still G-idle has the highest views.
I will not watch Queendom without G-idle 
Let Mamamoo take the 
And G-idle will always be the Rookie Monster and the Dark horse❤️
=
OMG I already love the original but in this version you can literally feel the pain
=
WHY I FEEL IT LIKE I WATCH A MUSICAL PERFORMANCE? OMG CHILLLSSSSSS
=
This performance was absolutely amazing
=
Insane performance QUEENS
=
Definitely the winner ‍♀️
=
bruh i tot this was eung eung when I heard the start of the song in my browser while doing work TWO QUEENS INDEED
=
1:17 *ImPAcTeiSHIoN*
=
guys dont expect too much on queendom, everyone can be the winner :)
=
This is art
=
Esta genial! Me encantó como Soyeon arregló la canción de esta manera, es una genia. Ame totalmente el concepto, esta presentación es ESPECTACULAR, para mi en esta ronda debieron ganar primer lugar, pero ni modo. Espero que en la final queden en primero y me sorprendan como lo hicieron.
G-Idle suerte!
=
1:43 Yuqi smirking
=
STAN TALENT ONLY!!❤❤❤
=
Mimi's reaction in Soyeon's rap part is so scary
=
Str3am lion on melon/itunes/spotify
=
This is an english comment that you looking for :)
=
Amazing performance! They deserve all the good things in K-pop, they're terrific! Their talent is art. This is magic.
=
Still can't believe this didn't win
=
Who listen lion here ??
=
I like this concept!!!
=
i am mesmerized. what a fascinating performance.
=
gldel 4st place？？？wtf mnet
=
10m coming
=
2:34 ,oh soo jin
=
Im the english comment ur looking for 
=
心中的第一名！！！！！！！
=
:O
=
Not a Gidle fan but, 
I don't really understand how they ended up 4th in the overall rankings. This performance was clearly the best performance out of all of them. But alas, I suppose others have a different opinion. 
I hope this would not discourage Gidle to go for more stages like this, because this performance was literally so good. I would love to see more of these performances from them.
=
Minnie really shines in these darker concepts, it’s incredible (they all shine but Minnie just catches my eye the most in darker concepts) 
She reminds me of a pretty gothic doll
=
Soyeon-Psychopath
Miyeon-Ghost
Minnie-Haunted Doll
Soojin-Vampire
Yuqi-Zombie
Shuhua-Witch
=
It's about a woman who loves her so much that she wants to kill a man and keep him with her forever.  Blue men are dead, and red dresses are bloodied wedding dresses. The story of a crazy woman who loved a man so much.
=
When this group always had the best views but never made  at the top. Im-
=
*LION IS ON SPOTIFY AND ITUNES GO AND LISTEN TO IT* *LETS GET THEM AT THE TOP*
=
I swear they are the best kpop girl group of all time... They going to be so famous.. So so famous
=
THE BEST PERFOMANCE!!! WHO ELSE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF HAVING THIS KIND OF CONCEPT ON A BALLAD SONG?
=
This is amazing no matter what they get placed 2nd or 5th I'll still love them what matters is the girls worked hard and I'm very proud of them yes I am a bit mad that they got placed fourth and it was a very unique performance but I love them no matter what
=
This kind of concept! 
=
This is the best show in my heart.
=
g idle never fails
=
Minnie's expression TT
=
(G)-IDLE ROCKS!!!
=
This is some pretty crazy yet amazing sh*t
=
Stream Lion especially in Korean chart, keep it up!
=
Shame on you MNET 
=
AMAZING❣❣❣❣❣
=
I still have mixed feelings about them placing 4th... I know they added the points from vocal, Performance and this mission, but still
=
Just a english comment passing by 
I got goosebumps from this performance G(idle) is on fire!
=
I'm the english comment that you're be looking for
=
iCONIC PERFORMANCE. PERIODT.
=
Berasa nonton gonjiam gua pas opening nya 
=
This is badass!
=
Mamamoo is my favorite group. OMG is my second favorite group. But I have to say (G) I-DLE should have won this round. Soyeon - I have liked everything you have created so far. You and Hui (Pentagon) are two of the most creatively talented people in K-Pop today. Teddy move over.
And have to say Shuhua and Minnie just so beautiful here.
=
not a fan of this group but performance is stunning
=
WOWWWWW! 
=
For who looking for English comment ^.^
=
Everyone: yuqi is so cute
Yuqi here: I am gonna end this man whole career
=
Просто бомбезно 
=
Idols are actors too...... to express the emotion of the song. And idle did tHAT
=
G-idle may not the first place but they got second place for brand reputation under BTS this month and They got viewer's heart
=
This performances won online viewers' hearts..we don't need the ranking from this show...we let the world choose...at the end, talent will always stand out the longest..
=
Me: Mom, it's Idle...

A few minutes later: Mom, I'm scared

Mom: AMAZING
=
Mnet give them 4 th place. But actually they got 1st place from worldwide
=
Other groups were good.
I am a Moomoo, MMM's stage almost made me cry.
I like OMG Seunghee's performance.
But I still think this is my 1st place stage.
=
It's ok g-idle is wining big on this show ranking doesn't matter because of those weird rules and it's crystal clear from the views they are wining more fans that what matters and lion is a masterpiece
=
Sometimes I think Korea or just MNET can't appreciate art.. This performance was PURE ART. 
Fourth place? You're kidding me, right? ¬¬
=
this is by far the most amazing stage i have seen in a long time! i am a dancer myself and this has inspired me on so many levels while i have been in a creative down. this is it!! 
ALSOOO does anyone know where i can enjoy this performance and not be interrupted by the reactions?
=
congratulation to (G)I-DLE for winning the best performances that picked by youtube's viewers. Mnet's ranks doens't mean anything!!
=
As much as I love Oh My Girl and am excited they got first again, Gidle deserved that first place title this round. That performance was stellar.
=
When she wipes off the lipstick she looks like Azula!
=
This performance is seriously too good
=
GIDLE ILOVE YOUU  PERFORMANCE
=
(G)idle was amazing even though they got 4th in this... soojin was 
You still got the viewers heart
=
1:49 SHUHUA SLAYINGGGGGG our neverlands who say she is untalented¿
=
I still can't believe they didn't win this mission???
=
Woahhh omg its amazing wow incredible i cant believe
=
TFK!!!WHAT A BLIND AUDIENCE THEY ONLY GOT 4TH PLACE IN THIS ROUND
=
who are the groups that reacted to idle?? i enjoyed this more seeing their faces ahahahahha
=
Actually I’m here to search the group which downvoted them in the comment  anyone has idea?
=
I think soyeon's rap and the beat drop after it feels a bit wrong in there it's just not fitting in the whole stage aura for me
=
guys please vote for G idle ( best dance performance group) at mwave so they can attend MAMA 2019 this year and hopefully win . PLEASE T_T 
also please vote for them on the k-stars Tournament :) thank you x
=
Cant believe this one didn't get the first place :(( such a masterpiece
=
Ni baru betul kesurupan
=
3:06
=
This performance is amazing, i agree, but i can understand Why it got 4th place ... cause they did so well, across my screen i was almost scared so in live ... brrrrr
=
❤
=
They definitely number one
=
SOYEON IS A MF GENIUS. SHES LIKE A BURNING PIT OF FIRE THAT NEVER GOES OUT
=
Miyeon: Siren (Female creature who lures her victims with her voice & beauty)
Minnie: Haunted doll (her expressionless face)
Soojin: Vampire (the way she wiped away her lipstick looked like she was wiping away blood)
Soyeon: Psychopath/Killer (her grin)
Yuqi: Witch (her hair lol)
Shuhua: Ghost (pale skin)
=
If they don’t comeback with this concept then what’s the point
=
The biggest joke in history if this perf won't win No.1
=
Please vote for the girls at #0011.
It's reflected in the girls' rankings.
=
1:25 2:31 3:02
=
Without words... this is perfect, powerful and JSBDDNDL
=
Me encantó!
=
2:44
=
Love you Yuqi! 
=
I watched all 6 performances and this one is the literally the best. I am not even being bias! 
The vocals, the choreography, the acting, the concept
Everything small detail is on point! 
Im so disappointed in the live voters!
=
Guys vote g idle in Mama 2019
=
I’m not gidle fan but I’ve been getting into them a lot alongside AOA.
=
DAFUQ DID I JUST WATCH?? Literally had to cover my mouth while watching because of how unbelievable the stage was. I got goosebumbs. I was in awe. I was freaked out. I was so freakin amazed. Damn this girl group will soar to unbelievable places if managed right.
=
THEY DESERVE BETTERRR THIS STAGEE WAS AWESOMEEEEEEE OMGGGF ❤❤❤
=
soojin's mental breakdown face just gave me goosebumps.
=
3:06
Me reacting to soojin
=
Soyeon that rap tho. That was awesomeeeeee.. ❤️❤️❤️ For Minnie eyes.. I admire your  eyes so much.
=
yuqi is so beautiful but she got even more with this hair 
=
1st place is here !
=
The performance is awesome but I'm sadly (g)Idle got 4th. they are so talent love (g)Idle ❤❤❤
=
The opening might be a lil' fire hazardous as its with alcohol and wax candle......but

EXCELLENCE SHINING FROM IDLE
=
Whoaaaa..... G idle is an another level  Daebakkk!!!!
=
We’re all mad that they got 4th place but let’s look at this objectively. It’s a terrifying performance, the audience (most of them) were scared despite the creativity in it. Also mnet’s a snake lmao
=
What can I say is gidle is on another level..even they were new group but they slays every stage like fire
=
A masterpiece  
=
can't believe they only got 4th place with this stage.
=
My QUEEN  
=
Can't believe that they got 4th place. Mygosh they deserve a 1st place because this is the best performance that really gives a goosebumps.
=
WHO HURT SOYEON ?! I can feel the pain in my heart
The lyrics are so deep and meaningful,  i'm crying like a fetus
Although the audience of this show is a bullshit to set them on the 4th place, they are first in my heart
=
Is mnet nuts? How is this performance just 4th place? Same as AOA's Egoistic's stage. Everyone knows it deserves 1st place and yet it only ranked 3rd.
=
2:34 she look like jihoon
=
Always support (G)I-DLE!
MNET pls wash your eyes.
=
WHAT!!!!!! Mnet are u joking with us ! This performance was 4th hahahah and mamamoo is 2nd this is so annoying
=
Streaming anybody?
=
Melhor grupo da atualidade, sem mais nem menos!!!
=
Lion is out on spotify now
=
=
This was 4th ................
=
Please perform this at MAMA
=
2:25
=
At this point we don't care about ranking bcz idle is the most watched and praised by netizens 
=
Minnie's visual are no joke. And her voice is so addictive. She has that mysterious vibe that makes you want more of her.

Gidle never disappoints. Each  of them are just so special and you just have to see this stage to see how incredible they are but I just wanted to highlight Minnie's presence.
=
SOYEON JINJJA CREPPY
=
Im not gidle fans, but
THIS IS WHAT WE CALLED PERFORMANCE! SRSLY THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS JUST KILLED IT! ITS HARD TO SEE IDOLS THAT HAVE THE GREAT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS THAT MATCH THEIR SONG BUT THEY JUST KILLED IT SRSLY!!
=
I LOVE YOU
=
Oh my god
=
Minnie: Witch
Yuqi: Voodoo Doll
Shu Hua: Lady in Red
Soo Jin: Kayako
Soyeon: Serial Killer
Miyeon: Red Riding Hood
=
I just don’t understand why they end up being no.4. To me this is definitely the best performance.
=
I really thought that they will get the first place arghhh I am so proud of Gidle but I am so angry at the show they put so much effort in this performance
=
If latata sorcerer won 1st place... Then Say No nightmare already top that off. This is no ranking already tbh it's godtier level lmao they do not belong in any ranking in Queendom
=
I hope G-idle knows how many people absolutely loved this performance, even though they placed 4th. It was so deeply moving and I'd hate for them to think that their effort and passion was wasted 
=
This performance is on a different level. I don't understand why it's ended on 4th place.
=
They are in an ENTIRETY DIFFERENT LEVEL. Proof that mnet is a snake‍♀️
=
1:44  can you see that smirk on yuqi face oh my heartue
=
who else comeback for this performance? i came here almost everyday to replay this 
=
I can't understand why they get 4th, I think it is the most impressive performance.
=
Probably their best performance out of the whole show!! It was amazing!! SOOJIN MY BIAS QUEEN KILLED IT LIKE ALWAYS
=
The best performance i've watch!!!
=
i want them to perform this on awards show so much
=
I can't really understand why they get 4th place.The deserve more.I always support them.Love them from myanmar
=
1:22
4:07 on replay
=
This left me speechless!!! All I can say is KICK ASS performance!!!
=
Best performance I ever seen.
=
this art 4th place? what a joke...im really upset with mnet, this was the best performance, or at least should have been one of the 3 best performances in ranking.....neverlands support g-idle streaming their new song and buy it if you can to support them at itunes please, they deserve it T_T
https://music.apple.com/es/album/lion/1484902998?i=1484903003
=
Srsly? 4th? Why MNet? 
=
Me quiero dar un montón de likes AHHHHH~~ amooo❤️
=
Soyeon it’s a really good leader
=
Congratulations neverlands our girls are second place after bts for brand reputation ranking for this month ☝️
=
They won a new fan, like, I watched the show bc of Mamamoo(Stan talent), and then this group appeared and THEY ARE SO GOOD, SO VERSATILE, SO ORIGINAL, I’m obsessed whit this video
=
I love how shuhua barely has a verse but has the biggest impressions
=
Now if I see soyeons small self  climbing my walls in my house asking me if I'm going go leave I'm going to say yes and burn down the house and that's on period
=
Stream their New song is LEON is on fire!
=
No entiendo coreano, pero se me enchino la piel. Se lucieron G-dle las AMODORO 
=
Perfect show ♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
Minnie make me scream;( but it so pretty
=
STREAM LION PLEASEEEEE
=
Lol we all know about M votes manipulation from produce 101 and produce 48 so not even surprised at their rankings anymore ‍♀️
=
Is that MNet or knetz who cant appreciate Soyeon genius brain??
=
Their song is so meaningful. The choreo wow... They deserve to win they deserve to be know in this industry.
=
1:56
=
this is the best performance , are u kidding mnet ??!  gidle should win for sure
=
Omg miyeon cute so pretty ya Tuhan
=
漲速有点慢诶，女孩子们冲啊！！aaaaaa
=
They’re all ready to have their own concert.
=
มีคนไทยไม่ใช่หรอ ไปถึงเกาหลีแล้วทำไมไม่แสดงความเป็นไทยให้คนเกาหลีล่ะ
=
Did they win?
=
Minnie looks like someone who has been broken far too many times and is numb to the pain. Soojin looks like someone who has been used too many times and has been wondering why of all people, it was her who's suffering. And Soyeon looks like a psychopath ready to kill.
=
Just my thoughts on their final 4th ranking position: I guess the reason why they’ve gotten 4th place was because the audience who voted viewed this performance ‘live’ instead on TV. As such, it’s definitely harder to witness the artistic emotions and movements portrayed by each of the (G)IDLE members in the ‘live’ recording studio. Also, the final ranking was combined along with the vocal + dance performances earlier on, which unfortunately, they have gotten 3rd (Minnie) & 3rd (Soojin).
=
WHO IS THE BEST IN THIS GENERATION?
(G) I-DLE
=
=
4th place? what kind of bs is this
=
2018 Latata
2019 Lion
2020 Legend
=
Still upset that they didn't perform in MAMA and MMA 2019
=
Soyeon is the best rapper,leader,producer of this generation
=
For my personal opinion, i think they should have win the competition because i mean they served us with a crazy concept, powerful song, designer-like outfits, representative choreography, and basically everything, that i forgot this is not a mma's or mama's performance. I'm not saying that mamamoo did bad, but i think compared to gidle's stage?. And you should keep in mind that gidle is still a new group so, to be able to held a performance like this is INCREDIBLE.
=
Shuhua honey this was your night! They are winners for me
=
This is literally the best stage ever! How come they didn’t win!!!!
=
they should have won easily, wtf are koreans thinking
=
Not having LION stage in MMA and MAMA is a big loss
=
Mnet get all their money from gidles utube views and yet gidle still not invited to MAMA. Shame on you MNET.
=
say it with me: 
WE NEED GIDLE STAGE IN EVERY YEAR END AWARDS. WITHOUT GIDLE STAGE IT'S BORING
now repeat 100 times a day.
=
They didn’t seem to compete
I mean like what did they compete for when the real crown is on their heads?
=
We all want GIDLE IN MAMA2019!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
I am really surprising about Shuhua. she's really talented. Cube should push her more. I really like this girl and I expect her a lot
=
mnet r afraid of inviting gidle to mama coz they dont want them to burn the stage
=
I gotta say Soyeon is so powerful
=
MAMA you better invite Gidle in mama 2019 ........All fans want LION performance. ....
=
Some of award show this year kinda boring when they dont invited gidle to perfom..maybe they don't kill all charts but in term of perfomance, they is the number 1 for me because they tell the story in the perfomance, not just sing and dance
=
MMA and MAMA you lost this kind of performance!! So bad
=
we need this on MAMA 2019..we need them to represent women..this performance oozes with girl power
=
Who's speaking?She's great at english
=
This >>>>>> Any performance of MAMA 2019.
=
Came here again after their i-talk. And I didn't know that Soyeon sang a wrong lyrics and Minnie is sick and she can't breath through her nose and she breathes through her mouth instead. Shuhua cried because she thought she didn't do well.
=
My favorite things about this stage:
The use of a militaristic dance: Sure, we see it in boy group dances all the time, but it has never been used so powerfully and strongly in a girl group dance. There is raw power and absolutely no soft edges in the marching procession during the intro and I AM HERE FOR IT.
The raw emotion and pain in the song. This is definitely a power song, but there's also an undertone of pain; it's very difficult for any woman to rise to the title of queen without making enormous sacrifices along the way. It's a power that is found through pain; not power that is just handed down.
The transition of lion claws to a crown. POWERFUL.
=
Minnie was like "I can prove that I can sing high notes" dang..
=
Shuhua getting that confidence from Mama Soojin.
=
I will never get tired of watching this performance
=
It's not that Shuhua can't sing. It's because she can't speak korean fluently at first. Sometimes shuhua talked in korean with china accent. But now her korean accent getting better so she get a longer part than usually.. 
Eonni likes you, Shuhua ♥
=
bravo!
gidle never disappoint us.
They are the queen and soyeon is that lion
=
This performance is epic..
=
their stage presence is just....out of the world
=
i wonder if their styliste has some arab origine
=
I'm a MOOMOO and I'm really happy that MAMAMOO won. But I'm going to be honest, I like this song more than 'Destiny', and I think (G)-IDLE is a very talented group and I'm starting to fangirl them lol.
=
still don't understand how they didn't win...
=
I like this stage than the normal one.
Also I like how Shuhua voice can hear clearly here.
=
Probably, one of the best tv-performances of the decade. Not joking. And I’ve seen a lot.
=
this made me shiver i love them so much
=
Soyeon : IM A QUEEN 
ME : slay queen slay
=
Mma and mama this year sucks
=
MAMA INVITE GIDLE..THEY DESERVE WIN
=
HOLY SHIT. POINT BLANK THIS IS THE BEST STAGE
=
0:28 -​1:15 who is she
i like her accent a lot
=
my bias shuhua is finally getting what she deserves, she’s literally shining i’m so proud of her
=
I totally love the roar after Minnie's high note
=
I’m a huge moomoo, been with mamamoo since debut....but y’all really telling me that (g)i-dle didn’t win....EVEN AFTER THIS PERFORMANCE
=
I can't move on  this is so iconic huhu
=
Definitely one of the most unique stages I have ever seen
=
Don’t worry Gi-dle, talent won’t betray you. You’ll hit big soon.
=
They performances are ALWAYS PHENOMENAL! Those girls are so talented, they  concept are unique and powerful, they songs are very captivating, there is something very catching in this group that i can't explain (but it's probably their attitude, talented, personalities e etc) and I cannot fall in love more with g (idle)!!
=
Stage performance ✅
Visuals ✅
Vocals ✅
Everything is on point.
=
Does anyone else watch this several times a week or is that just me?
=
This performance was legendary with the back up dancers I’m-
=
Miyeon is a goddess
=
Soyeon: I'm a queen!!
Me: you are really a queen!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
Hello gryffindors how do guys like this song so far
=
Maybe you didn't notice that the blond girl at the beginning story only has 4 fingers
=
Queens THEY OWNED MAMA 2019 ( don’t mind me I’m just imaging this as a mama performance)
=
their expressions are killing it—
=
You want lion performance ?? *VOTE FOR GIDLE on Seoul music award*
=
I dont believe, this perfomance didnt win the competition..
Whats wrong to korea netizen?
=
this group gets better and better, they perform a song brilliantly, one of the best groups out there .
=
Its a joke that mnet didnt invite them to MAMA...haha you miss something good shit mnet
=
I think they're the best female performers and just with EXO when it comes to mind blowing stage presence!
=
Can we just take a moment and appreciate the back up dancers?
=
Mnet you should invite (G)I-DLE IN MAMA they need to perform this legendary song called 'LION' and the world needs them ok? Neverland fighting! 
=
I love this kind of song. It's not too girly or acting cute. I loveee itttt
=
Still feel sad they didn't get 1st place in the competition. This is MAMA material pfft. I'm so proud of our girls. I remember accidentally clicking latata when it first came out and supported them since then. I thought to myself "ahh this is what ive been looking for in kpop ever since 2ne1 disbanded." They are a legend in the making. Cant wait to see them grow into their full potential.
=
I always found this whole competition worthless and unnecessary but, without it, songs like Destiny, Lion, Guerrilla etc wouldn't exist. So thank you mnet, partially
=
12 M proof that they are the winner
=
Whose here to watch this again after the I-talk that shuhua cried in to enjoy her performance again, and also try to catch soyeon wrong lyrics she mentioned hahaha
=
Shuhua is not a baby anymore. She's a Queen like a Lion!
=
(G)I-DLE didn't win Queendom but the girls have won the heart of enormous k-pops fans, the girls have put their blood and soul to this amazing performance, Soyeon is a music genius and will be becoming successful CEO like JYP one day
=
My first time watching this performance from this Queens ❤
=
I looove these girls!!! 
SHUHUA IS SOOO PRETTYYYYY
=
For the first time I had goosebumps after 2ne1 performance!!! I need CL and SOYEON in  one stage!!
=
"I create a new path that no one has attempted before.
All those condescending people will lick their tongues, but the applause I received after breaking the prejudice is thrilling. I've had a taste now I can't deny it I'M A QUEEN!"
This lines though are chilling ❤
=
Legends❣️
=
This was my favourite performance in the final - the story was coherent, the costumes matched the theme, and it had so much drama.  They used the stage so well.  The song itself was also just exceptional.
=
5:18 Soyeon: I'm a queen!
OMG she knows
=
Still the best performance of the year...
=
One of the most legendary stage by girl group in kpop history, a world-class quality.
Neverland couldn't be more proud of (G)I-DLE.
=
imagine they did this for mama 2019 woah i swear it will be the most iconic thing ever
(if they can perform there)
=
Who's the one with the long pony tail? I would drop the knee to that one.
=
Soyeon: "before queendom ends, i wanna make sure all my members shined throughout all our performances"
and she made Shuhua shined on this stage ❤ she's the best leader you can ever asked for ❤
=
I AM PROUD THAT I CAN SAY I WATCHED THIS PERFORMANCE LIVE
=
This is one perfomance
=
That intro was truly a beast
=
the amount i watch this performance is unhealthy
=
Any Armyland here?
=
CHILLS. QUEENS. LIONS. IDLE IS ENORMOUSLY UNDERRATED
=
They don't just only compete, they made the theme song for Queendom.
=
4:40 that girls voice though 
=
soyeon is a queen
=
I hate g-idle...


Because they wrecked me and now they are my ultimate girl group
=
i want idle to perform lion in mama 
=
This performance is LEGENDARY. JUST WOW! The part when MINNIE show off her vocals. WOW
=
Miyeon slaying with her amazing stable vocals, Minnie's high note that reached the hearts of all Neverlands, Soojin stealing hearts with just a glance, Soyeon's killer rap, Yuqi's perfect low voice and Shuhua finding her confidence and getting the lines she deserves. (G)I-DLE was perfect before, but this song brings them another level up. They are queens like lions. Stan Talent.
=
Coming back here after watching MAMA. Seriously this performance was going to slay
=
The best performance Kpop 2019 Lion (G)I-DLE
=
Mnet like v*ews (G)idle in every perfomance because their win Money, but no invited mama, joke hard
=
THIS IS THE MOST EPIC PERFORMANCE THAT I EVER SEEN EVER.
=
Why is no one talking about the backup dancers?? THEY SLAYED IT LIKE NO ONE
=
I love the perfomance i love (G)I-DLE
=
So, they're the real Lannister family...
=
ok so best outfits of the music video goes to these ones, literally looked like royalty girls, i'm so impressed with this comeback
=
I think that G(I)dle is my favorite comeback!!!!!
=
This >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> mma2019
=
I am  Mamamoo stan and love their voices and songs but tbh, (G)-  Idle should have won Queendom
=
Yall,the dancers did great too.
=
VOTE THIS SEUL MUSIC ARWARD
=
The way they all sat down on their thrones. *Q U E E N S*
=
I am still watching this masterpiece 
=
(G)I-DLE MAMA 2019 !!!!!!!
=
I wondered who sing that high note and there she is..MINNIE THE QUEEN no doubt
=
Mnet Plzzzzzzzzzz invite them for MAMA 2019...
THEY'LL BLOW UP♥️
=
The beginning sounds like blood sweat and tears bts's beginning. But at all I love this
=
Soyeon please take over the Cube's place.. Save (G)I-DLE, CLC, PENTAGON, BTOB, ALL TRAINEE & so on... I don't want Cube mistreat their career...
=
Legendary
=
MAMA 2019 PERFORMANCE OF LION WE NEED IT
=
Imagine this at an award show 

With Intro + Dance Break + Outro 
=
Soyeon Queen!!!
=
5:45 these scene is SO AMAZING look at the backup dancer crawling behind our queen and following them to the throne
=
Need this in mama
=
WTFFFF I LOVE IT!!! IM NOT EVEN A FAN. I THOUGHT ITS MAMA ALREADY — PLEASE PERFORM THIS IN AWARD SHOWS Jaeballl
=
This was the BEST performance I've seen in a while. WOW, just wow!
=
This is the powerful songs in Queendom. They might not the winner but this songs loved by many people Korean and International Pepz Most watched. PANALO pa rin talaga.
=
Dudeeee ...........
Shuhua intro literally chills and goosebumps 
Lion‍♂️‍♂️‍♂️
=
Maybe Idle knew they weren’t gonna be invited so they gave a MMA/MAMA worthy performance 
=
Shuhua who made the entrance beastly amazing.Let's appreciate her
=
4:10 kills me every time! Love them! ❤️
=
The intro was just, wowww
=
Legendary
=
The fact that Shuhua broke down because she thought she didn’t do well enough and messed up in the lyrics
But we all think she did absolutely amazing. She shined and made the stage alive, plus the intro was absolutely fantastic! 
Shuhua, you did so well! I hope you come to accept that ❤️
=
34m mv+perfomance one moth queens
=
It's disappointed...Gidle didn't attend at MMA and MAMA 2019, 
but they'll attending at GAON CHART MUSIC AWARD 
on January 8, 2020.
And Gidle'll explode their performance in there, Why not ?
=
so im just gonna pretend that (g)i-dle kick off the mama awards show with this perf!
=
I’ll never get tired of  talking about Shuhua 
She’s slayed 
She’s beautiful 
She’s talented 
She’s the hidden weapon she is Shuhua ❤️❤️
=
When  ı need  some  power  in my blood  ı m finding  myself in this  perform thank you  idle  so much  love  and support  
=
Still hurts they are not attending mama
=
Omggg i got goosebumpss KPOP INDUSTRY NEEDS GIDLE
=
Shuhua makes me so proud
=
This performance hit me so hard I can't lie I got tears. This was just amazing!!!!
=
Stage the best in kpop . (G)I-DLE Queen for me and I Like Voice Minnie 
=
I haven't been calling them all Queens from the first day for nothing.
=
Queens
=
wow man they're so incredible
=
Minnie is gorgeous, mysterious and captivating beauty!
=
One of the best performances I've ever seen. So many different things going on and well executed!! Gidle Queenz
=
omg shushu has so much confidence now i was i was wow i'm speechless she stands out so much here i think she suits this cocnept the best just my opinion and her voice is so clear i love it
=
Queens of k-pop
=
Woo! That was awesome! Gidle are really undefeatable! Soyeon and Soojin really looks like a LION!
=
Damn im proud of soyeon from being down on her self for not having the same visuals as the other produce 101 girls to standing on stage yelling shes a queen 
=
Soyeon: I'm a queen!
Me: No Soyeon, you are goddess ❤
=
I don't know why this performance drove me to tears
=
Omg (G) i-dle you girls are the real lions 
=
I thought this was an award performance?!?! OMG This is too much to handle 
=
30million mv
=
This performance fits perfectly for the final stage.
=
This performance-12 M   ALL (5) the other performances combined-13 M ........That tells you everything.
=
I can't move over (G) I-dle Queendom performances.
My daily routine is watch in order LATATA "remix", Fire "cover", Put it Straight "Nightmare" (I like the original song but I love the nightmare version...) and Lion.
I'm addicted to (G) I-dle voices and Soyeon rapping.
Now I'm totally their fan....
=
Can we hit 15 million views by the end of this year? Coz that's what this masterpiece deserves.
=
This feels like a mama performance hahaha
=
this perf will forever be iconic and legendary
=
Maybe a few years from now, we'll get a lion stage on award shows
=
WHO THINKS G-IDLE IS A TRUE LEGEND?
=
I really love mamamoo more than gidle, but this a AMAAAZING performance, and they should win
=
Miyeon ma queen 
=
This is the first gg that I think has the strongest individual traits for its members bside  Twice. Stanned!
=
Tbh, I think they deserve to be on top 3.
=
Oh god this is amazing
=
Go on with Queendom 2nd season 3rd season.... etc
Lion stage will be remembered regardless of ranking, like it or not.
=
Mama 2019 is missing this ❤️❤️❤️
=
OmG Shuhua ❤ she always took my attention from the very start and Yuqi 
=
4:10 I literally shivered and shook, Minnie's got a voice no one can ever imagine
=
They dont feel like a recent group at all....THEY ARE LEGENDS 
=
could be one of the best kpop performances of all time
=
I wish I could see them perform this in MMA or MAMA this year and see other idols reacting to this because this performance was so extraordinary
=
going back here after watching their i-talk, Shuhua, baby, you crying over a small mistake--- this was your night. this is your song. I hope you can see all the good comments about you here. Cheer up, love.
=
this is majestic.
=
女娃们走花路吧！我们一起加油
=
THEY ARE FREAKING UNDERRATED
=
The best....
So cool... i like it
Jeon Soyeon very cool...
=
Mama didn't invite our babies  I'm so sad for this. MAMA bvr l mia bolood bx ymaa  ta nar oilgxgu ch gsn setgelee ongoilgoydoo
=
legit got goosebumps from the intro-
=
I feel moved that shuhua did so great and improved that  muchhhhh

=

=

=
if they don't end up in MAMA i swear i will bring dead bodies
=
Now we know why Shuhua has few lines
And that is the most beautiful stage video I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE 
(Sry for my bad english )
=
This remember me to Narnia movie
=
That was amazing as always, but Soyeon was--- wow!
=
Every comeback gets better and better look seriously I expect nothing less from my queens
=
everytime i'm hearing Minnie's high note, gosh! goosebumps!
=
12M nevies attack
=
I don't like the fashion but the song and intro is good and their makeup is also good
=
2:00 can't get over that roar. This intro is so epic.
=
When I watch this for the first time, and Shuhua start singing, I was screaming "SHUHUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA YOU ARE THE BEST NOONAAAAAA" and then my lil' bro come to my room and told me "SHUT THE HELL UP, I HAVE EXAM TOMORROW". Then I told him to sit down and look at this, and he was like "What's the name of the group and the name you were shouting earlier?" .
=
Wow I love this group they go all in an kill it everytime it's new an different compared to other groups I love this group
=
Soyeon the lion king that look like queen
=
haters: Shuhua can't sing, she's just visuals
Shuhua : "I look like a lion, I'm a queen like a lion"
=
4:56 she did THAT
=
They are truly the QUEEN
=
Shuhua you are a Queen ❤️❤️
=
Look at the viewers count, over 10m, g idle have so many international fans including me
=
That's almost better than mama stages literally what the fck
=

=
Verdadeiras rainhas ♡ Amuh tanto essas coisinhas ácidas ♡
=
むちゃくちゃかっこいーーー！！！
=
Can I say this. A large part gidle's image is because of soyeon. She is involved in the making of songs and her rap always hold a very central part in their songs plus her presence on stage is out of this world. Despite this she doesn't overshadow the other members. Each member is so unique and charming in thwir own right that the group is really well balanced. Gidle is really successful and will be more because of this reason
=
Shuhua cried after their performance because she she was not satisfied poor shuhuaYOU DID GREAT BABY❤️
=
ARE YOU KIDDING?? THEY SHOULDVE WON
=
The choreography is so enjoyable to watch ❤️
=
ARRASARAM <3
=
Their outfits are so GORGEOUS, so I really cried
=
Minnie's vocal range is so incredible honestly, she started the song in such a low note and then progressed to hit that amazing high note later
=
this is shuhua's era
=
i feel a bit of narnia vibes here
=
Best performance i have ever seen
=
How did they not win 
=
Who else is back here after the MV trailer? ‍♀️
=
This is my kind of concept, next to 2ne1.
=
THEY DID THAT, WE ARE THAT; QUEEN LIKE A LION 
=
LION
=
Wow this crazy awesome!
=
*Latata* - InLove

So no one is gonna talk about their outfits （＾_＾）
=
Cersei Lannister's
=
(G)I-DLE會紅是很正常的...試想一個超強的詞曲創作人兼舞台設計，全心全意的打造一個團體，幫每個團員選擇最合適的歌曲位置跟最完美的舞台配置，團員本身也很有自己的辨識度不至於完全像大人帶孩子...能有娟真的是方塊祖墳冒煙...

=
Yuqi!! 
=
this song hits harrrrdd
=
amazing gidle
=
I started loving g-idle because of Minnie. But not really like a hardcore stan. I just love their music and style! ❤️
=
Minnie didn't even watch her step when walking down the stairs. A queen indeed.
=
step on meee!!!!!
=
1:27
=
Udah gawaras sih inimah konsepnya,udah gila!! Keren banget!!
=
So Shuhua just went and did THAT? Okay birthday twin I see you
=
wow
=
Legendary performance
=
I'm crying when soyeon said "i'm a queen" 
=
Shuhua carrying her solo parts
She's improved so much it's like another person <3
=
Im here after watching i - talk shuhua crying special.... Why u crying for such an explosive performance dear beautiful? Shuhua u doin great....
=
Aww... LION's still high chart on Melon, after 3 weeks Gidle performed them in Queendom
Happy for these talented girls...Gidle !
=
I'm still not over this performance
=
So proud of our shuhua❤
=
Rooting for this performance in big award shows ..damn it's a big song
=
Who came back after watching (G)I-DLE’s backstage video of queen dom lion seeing Shuhua say she got wrong lyrics. Here to check . Didn’t notice lol
=
Coming after italk ep 47 to figure out which part did shuhua make a mistake..but i cant find any...She did it perfectly 
=
Just imagine this performance at MAMA~♡
=
THE BEST PERFORMANCE EVER!! ♡
=
Wow, This performance already reach 10M (10,322,067) view. Goosebumps
=
Wow this so epic!
=
Can we give some props to the backup dancers though?
=
4:49 yes Shuhua you're a Queen
=
who's here after watch the latest italk?
shuhua really do the most perfect performance, why she's crying? T_T
=
Is it weird that I dont really like the song but the live stage actually makes me change my mind a bit, lol.
=
SooJin's expression is no joke.
=
Haters: shuhua shouldn't debut with (g)i-dle!
Shuhua: *_*doing solo dances_** *_"HOLD MY LINES"_*
=
I can't believe shuhua is the strongest one in this stage like she own this song. Finally! I scream a lot for her at the time she sings the chorus part. This is her era and she suits with this kind of concept. Gidle is totally a monster group, they're talented and beautiful! Cube must be proud for them. They're in different level
=
ugh shuhua that stare!
=
I better see them perform Lion on mama awards this year, everyone would be shook!!
=
It's legendary
=
What I think she meant: when she said little girl she meant the youngest member and that was shuhua, the queen
=
Like 40M mv and this
=
I like YUQI , SHuHUA
=
Most Epic imposible
=
Gidle performance look like for MAMA 2019 !

เล่นใหญ่จิงงาน mama ป่ะนี้

Edit:Thank you so much guys for all the likes this is the first time I get so much likes! And those who help me to know that two girls name thank you so much to you to
=
this not what you call a rookie group this is what you call legendary✨
=
That was definitely one of the greatest live shows in kpop world 
They nailed it  G_IDLE fighting
=
Seriously nobody is doing like them, GIRL GROUP OF THE CENTURY!!!!
=
Congrats to I-dle. Third Queendom performance over 10 million. They stand alone.
=
This is one of the best performances I've ever seen. Not only talking about kpop, but music in general
=
New listener here... what is the name of the last girl that sang?  I like her voice
=
IMO if the votings r just based on final performance, AOA and G-idle r definitely the top 2
(dw i am happy for MMM)
=
I hope that they will perform at MAMA with this song
=
I love Soyeon's smirk when she says, "I'm a Queen," at the end of her Rap. My dear, you are a queen. I can't wait to hear what comes out of that brain of yours next.
=
I don’t care if they win or not, this was fucking epic.
Edit - Final rankings:
1 Mamamoo
2 Oh My Girl
3 (G) I-dle
4 AOA
5 Lovelyz
6 Park Bom
=
i always believe in this girls since day one im crying
=
gidle who actually deserve 1st place
=
I can't count how many times I already watched this performance, yet I'm still crying (especially Shuhua's solo+part and Soyeon's rap part make me sob like a baby)

They are queens, and nobody will change my mind.
=
Gidle is always killin' it! Shushu getting so much appearance is such a blessing 
=
Officially neverland now!!!
=
this is art
=
Like I am still watching this even though I already watched it mutiple times..what more can I say typically *GIDLE* .. *IF YOU GIVE THEM A STAGE THEY WILL KILL IT* they dont need Designer cloth or people who produce and write for them..they work for their dream and it shows
=
Wow!!! This live is something else!
=
People commented 'who watch this before it reachs 10M?'
And I come back because it has reached 10M guysss lets celebrateeee
=
Arthdal chronicles vibes

Alguien me explica de que trató queendom, no entendí. 
=
Can't they stop make me fall in love _-
=
Soyeon, Soojin and Minnie are real queens of fierce and power 
=
I’m happy Mamamoo win but G-idle impressed me the most. From a rookie group, they delivered a very good performances.
=
After hearing the meaning of the song this isn’t one members era it’s all their era they all shined
=
This will forever be one of (G)I-DLE's iconic stage performances in general. Perhaps the best one so far IMO. This wasn't even an end of the year award show, yet they killed it like it was an an end of the year award show stage. Lol
=
shuhua is stunning can't believe she is a real person
=
no one want to talk about the dancers? 
they are so energetic and sOoO goddess 
=
10M g idle on fire!!!!!

Omg their stage presence is simply unreal.
=
YUQI! 
=
Congrat 10M 
=
Mma performance: who are you?
Queendom performance: I'm you but stronger
=
Shuhua looked like a real warrior queen. These outfits are stunning
=
The fact that soyeon wrote this song, she’s so talented
=
Minnie: Soyeon, what are we going to do? The haters are getting way out of control. 
Soyeon: Ladies... it's time. 
Miyeon: You don't mean... 
Soyeon: Yes. Release the ShuShu.
=

=
When that blonde girl said “I’m a queen “ you can say by her expression that she knows she is and that she rocked it
=
THEY GOTTA PERFORM THIS A THE MELON MUSIC AWARDS
=
(G)I-DLE is literally the best girl group of the 3rd/4th generation for me.
=
4:59 I still love Soyeon's part, Its just so epic!
and our baby Shuhua really did a good job, she slayed on this final performance
=
For me, they deserve to win best female group❤️
=
4:48 she's tired of being underated
=
i love this perfomance❤️
=
2:19 I Feel Attacked..!! OMG!! Shuhua!!
=
I need this at a award show.
=
Days after the Queendom, I still love all their performances. I like all groups but I must say that Lion's lyrics is so amazing!!!!
=
We need this performance at the MAMA 2019 !!
=
the only other time I got these amazing goosebumps while watching a kpop performance was during 2NE1's Come Back Home comeback. looks like (g)i-dle are on their way to being just as legendary 
=
A new fan here ! THIS MUST BE THE BEST GG SAVAGE AND FIERCE SONG LOVE IT! what are their fans called because now I’m one of them !
=
You must see it !    search :     (G)I-DLE, LION - Videogame Style
=

=
I had goosebumps while watching this in Queendom
=
They will remain "queens forever " ~
=
Queens of kpop 30m in two weeks
=
Shuhwa really rock this stage!!!!!!!
=
MNET THIS IS A GREAT REASON FOR IDLE TO PERFORM IN MAMA 2019; MNET BETTER GIVE THEM THE STAGE
=
I'm sooooo obsessed with soyeon
=
Minnie: *high voice*
Me:screaming like seeing a ghost
=
=
Real winners -10m in every perfomance
=
this was definitely minnie and soyeons era they slayed and miyeon and shushua
=
2:28
=
Shuhua’s facial expressions>>>
=
Minnyy
=
When Soyeon said "I'm a queen" I felt that.
=
Miyeon the chorus queen, her voice and swagger is on point..
=
“now turn up the cheers, everyone look up, the young lion takes its crown” That’s them saying they’re taking over
=
 SIX MEMBERS OF (G)I-DLE ARE REALLY THE QUEENS LIKE A LION !!! 
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST IDOLS FOR SURE~
=
I'm dying to see other idols reaction to this
=
I don't stan them yet, I'm still trying to get to know them  but I'm pretty sure I'll stan them soon.
They were the best among the others. Hands down with this performance
=
This is so freaking amazing the song is just WOW I’ve been a gidle Stan for so long and I feel like this is just the best I’ve ever seen the backup dancers are so sharp and very good at what they do gidle is on point to even though they didn’t win they slayed the stage and were so good I love soyeon she nailed it ❤️
=
This is indeed legendary in kpop history 
Keep stre*ming the mv neverlands we are so close to 20M
=
I love gidle. Each and every one of them shine. Nevies fighting 
=
goddamn chills
=
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU GIRLS 
=
I really want this performance in MAMA music awards 
=
Wow, that was amazing!
=
Shuhua be like "papa paa papa paa papa paa..... I want that chocolate!" ♥️ Sooo sweetly she say papa paa I can't ...
=
im sorry but OMFG MINNIE SLAYED THIS COMEBACK SO HARD, g idle is made for hardcore dark songs like this, IDFC IF THEY DIDN'T WIN OR WHAT, THIS PERFORMANCE AND SONG ALONE MARKED GIDLE  A STRONG AND POWERFUL GROUP!! THEY CAN SLAY AND BE EVERYTHING WITHOUT ANY AWARDS, MY BITCHES ARE SLAYIN
=
I’m a blink and I thought only Blackpink would be the group that impressed me a lot but wow I’m amazed this performance was everything true queens 
=
Miyeon is so pretty ❤️❤️
=
Shuhua,    so much      
=
Tbh its hard to chose between GIdle and mamamoo. This group got good concept and other good vocal. Both have charm.
=
Love their outfit & makeup.
=
*gay goosebumps*
=
The power this song holds
=
ملكاااات
=
Their stylist needs a raise like seriously
=
Cube is so lucky to have soyeon. They need to serve her like a queen literally
=
Can we just talk about Minnie's high note??  The Rookie Queens
=
10M views <3
=
HISTORIC
=
Legends
=
Omg it doesn’t even feel like they’re a rookie group, I feel like they’ve been around for so long!
=
*watch them grow big and win daesangs in the future*

*PROUD NEVERLAND!!!*
=
THEY KILLED THIS, LIKE CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE DANCE MOVES, THE VISUALS, THE SONG, THE HIGH NOTES , THE RAP. 
THEY WORKED VERY HARD, LET'S GIVE THEM  WHAT THEY DESERVE
=
Minnie's high note went right to the ear and pierced straight to the heart  .. ugh . Truly a queen 
=
Damn they’re so beautiful
=
I can't wait to show this to my friend who says kpop is complete nonesense 
This is legendary!!!!!

Edit:this is my first time getting more than 1 like(which will be my own)thank you
=
Soyeons rap part gave me chills ❤
=
Oh my God I love this group so much, they always give an amazing performance❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
=
I really hope Gidle can perform on MMA again
=
Goosebumps with their perfomance and MINNIE vocals 
=
That intro..damn gurl..there's 6 lion queens dancing on the stage
=
WE WANT G IDLE IN MAMA , mnet do not play with us and just invite them
=
The best of performance.
=
So great to see Shuhua a moment to shine...
=
THE BESTTT
=
I been a fan since KDA pop stars. And I'm a huge fan of Park Bom, but this performance was "amazing!!" In my opinion the best on the show, by them or anyone else.
=
Honestly I think this is THE G-IDLE song. It speaks of their name and image best  U GO QUEENSSS
=
Our queens's performance is on FIREEEE
=
I am jaw dropping and forgot to breathe for 6:10 and basically i am dead now
=
man I'd love to be there to see this live~
=
it looks like a lion - i'm a queen like a lion ~
=
Have so many things to tell about this. First of all I guess this is the first showcase of "Lion". I already have watched MV and listened to it as well. Direction wise I loved it how it started, that holy bell ringing and I was waiting how its gonna blend with that intro music. Then the story came and so baby sua followed, made us realised how feirce she is. And then dang! the gang arrived, their stage presence, confidence, stability is to cry for. This song, just the audio is so strong so the MV is and now this stage performance shown how cool this girl group is.
=
every single second of the perf got me goosebump wow
=
This show is soooo impressive!
=
MINNIE’S VOCAAAALL
=
i love how this live has english captions.
=
A flirty girl will ignore this Legend stage~
=
THE POWER THESE GIRLS HOLD
=
minnie i'm in love
=
SHUHUA FIGHTING!!!!
=
yes all of you are the queens, dear ❤
=
I feel like we are not talking about Soyeon's smile after the rap part enough. I mean, just look at her. She really means it when she says she's the queen!
=
I really wish to (G)-idle became so famous in whole the world cuz they deserve it they really work hard specially Soyeon
=
Can't still believe why they didn't win this competition :((
=
Idk why I want BTS reaction to this masterpiece 
Time to stan
=
me: wasn't prepared
minnie: wonderful highnote
me: wasn't prepared but choked
=
They slayed the stage ❤
=
BEST PERFORMANCE EVEEERRR....damn goosebumpss
=
I'm not a korean so I really need the English translation of the song and it's WOW. MY GIRLS ARE NOT PLAYING Y'ALL.
=
Shuhua can step in my face and I would thank her ❤
=
OMG LORDDD IM CRYING BCAUSE THIS IS LIKE A CONCERT SWAGGG
=
Wowwwww I've never seen such a powerful rookies, a monster rookies indeed
=
But I still belive that, in that episode, (G)I-DLE should win by performance and song-produced base only. let's not include the voting system haha.
=
LITERALLY THEIR BEST STAGE!
=
YASHHH THE QUEENN!
=
OMG!!!! THIS IS A LEGEND
=
Yo wtf
I wasn't ready
They look like goddesses
=
Wow, amazing performance
=
OMG MIS REINAS LAS AMOOOOOOOOOOOOO
=
I love this concept so much!!
=
I AM SHOOKETH
=
I'm so proud of shuhua
=
圧巻のパフォーマンスですな〜
=
This is so powerful
=
Soyeon is such a leader and producer. She did her best to show off each of the members.
Also the fact that the main idea of Lion is how the little girl prove herself to be the champion despite being downplayed is brilliant. Shuhua lose confidence to have more lines because 'public' criticize her. And to have final stage of queendom proving she's better and the winner now....honestly there's no better song or stage for shuhua's first long line than this stage. Amazing of soyeon to push shuhua for this. Wonderful of shuhua to slay her chance.
Miyeon, Yuqi, Minnie, Soojin also nailed their perf. Thank you to the dancer and stylish team as well. This is such a wholesome performance
=
如果是真唱live 那是真的很厲害
=
When they walk towards the thrones and the wild animals crawling, 12M
=
THEY ARE REAL QUEENS
=
This was the best performance.
=
Nice concept.. I love it !!!!
=
okay we love a little bit of context
=
This is why Shuhua didn’t get that many lines from the start because she knows we will all dieeee she’s improved so much etc her stage presence she looks more confident and comfortable on stage her voice is a mix of the vocal line.
=
shuhua really spat on my face and called me ugly and talentless ugh *i stan* ❤
=
That high note...
=
I never had any doubt that they are queens
=
These perf on this show need to be perf at end of year awards they are just WOW 
=
4:04
4:04
=
The best girl group right now in my opinion 
=
So, her name is Minnie? She captures my heart everytime she sings.
=
What I love about I—DLE is how distinct their performances are. Like, each stage is different from the previous one. And you will remember an unique feature about it.
They've been doing it since their debut stages on music shows, with adding intros and dance breaks. Then later, did it again with their award shows performances (MMA, MAMA, etc). They're known for that and we all expect and anticipate their next performance. That's talent. 
=
WHY ARENT MORE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS
=
5:17
Soyeon : " *I'M A QUEEN !* "
Me         :   
=
Soyeon’s rap never fails to put me in my feels and wanna bop my head to it and just shout “I’M A QUEEN” with her. YESSSS HUNTY I STAN
=
My hope is to see (G)I-DLE going down in history as one of the greatest girl group of all time! Epic stage performance!
=
Oh my god (G) i-dle are the queens ❤️
=
This performance gave me goosebumps.... just can't stop listening to this song. Saranghaeyo, neverland
=
That was absolutely amazing. Soyeon’s rap verse though
=
It gives me goosebumps they are so good by the way this is the first time i watch them
=
I love (G)I-DLE 
=
the ending pose wow  0o0
love them so much!!
=
Omygod i feel like crying ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
They're the winner in my heart ❤
=
I really love how our Shuhua have grown. Go go go confident Queen! 
=
That was such a powerful performance. Simply amazing. Though... The music during the intro reminded me of something I've heard before. Maybe another intro... It wasn't exactly the same but it definitely had alot of similarities. It was still amazing non the less 
=
came from TRUE DAMAGE/KDA?
=
I'm shook.
=
— يُمـــاااهه فَخـــااممةة ،، .
=
Yuqi really looks like a lion
=
This can be a Lion Queen background music
=
I'm intimidated 
=
Legends
=
i stan the creative and the coreographer. this performance is dope.
=
Las amo demasiado 
=
10m perfomance 20m mv
=

=
The amount of BDE that comes from this is huge
=
Go to 30M mv nevies
=
their are the best
=
He looks like a lion I'm a king like a lion. 
=
พี่มินนี่❤
=
shuhua is the best❣❣
=
2:34 Can we talk about how Minnie walks down that stair while singing without even looking?
The high note I can't even talk about because I'm speechless.
=
Oh my god.. I can’t stop watching help.. haven’t witnessed a girl group like this since SNSD and 2ne1
=
These were all their poses at the end 6:03
*Soyeon* : Sexy
*Miyeon* : Princess
*Yuqi* : Swag
*Soojin* : Queen
*Minnie* : Cleopatra
*Shuhua* : Dark
=
I love this, THIS IS FIERCE. Amazing concept, the looks, the choreo, the song is amazing. Soyeon is an amazing leader and composer, she truly deserves all the attention she's getting.
=
If this is only ThEIR PERFORMANCE in mnet ... I wonder what the perfomance will be AT MAMA 2019 
=
The entrance was freaking AWESOME!
=
Soyeon's rap  best part
=
The breathtaking and powerful stage presence. Beautiful.
=
Why did i get goosebumps 
=
5:17 her smile, love Soyeooon
=
If you watched this masterpiece, then go watch it's MV now 
=
Still crying over Minnie's part
And shuhua finally  I keep repeating
=
The shuhua solo I can die peacefully now
=
OMG I LOVE GIDLE
=
Omg, so cool
=
That's a lot of views! Wow
=
You're our queens
=
4:55 ❤️
=
Omg the are queen's
=
Those outfits look expensive 
=
I had goosebumps thought the whole performance
=
Their best comeback. PERIODT
=
Lion mv OMG kill it
=

=
Yes yes I see some fallout boys vibe abit
=
L
I
O

=
Breath taking performance
=
9m omg
=
Shuhua.... U DID THAT. SIS OWNED THIS ERA PERIOD.
=
GIRL POWER!!
=
putting shuhua as the highlight is a freaking smart move! i'm so sure everyone has been waiting for shuhua's time to shine, and they are delivering it right to the door. they know how to win. (g)i-dle is undefeated.
=
the way soyeon smiled after her rap... that was so sexy. she knows that she's truly our queen 
=
Yuqi is still my number 1. Everyone else is number 2, but not far behind at all ❤️❤️❤️
=
(G)i-dle: *3rd place*
Also (G)i-dle: *Most viewed finale performance*
=
Соён капкара коздорун прям пленят мени

=
Im a queen like a lion
=
i lke shuhua's energy
=
I need K drama for this.
=
Coreo maravilhosa
=
2:23
=
看了不知幾遍了，實在忍不住不得不吹噓一下，這絕對是夠資格寫入歷史的舞台
=
Awards shows will make a huge mistake if they don’t invite gidle to the ceremony.
=
Even though this is their cb, but I feels its like their concert
=
Fandoms : fight over who's best
Me : stanning all of them, just enjoying all those songs and performances and thanking Mnet for getting them all together
=
I want (G)-IDLE perform their Put It Straight (Nightmare Ver.) & Lion on MAMA. I know I’m not the only one who want this happen.
=
(G)I-DLE is one of kpop’s most unique girl groups and I’m proud of them. The energy and passion these woman’s have is outstanding. I truly love them.
=
i dont stan them, i honestly only listen to a few of their songs, but i clicked this cuz the thumbnail looked cool, and this is so amazing!!! they are so powerfull its sooo good!
=
It's been a week but I'm still inlove with this performance.
edit: *a month
=
i love their performance. their stage presence, the aesthetic, the whole concept fits the title of the show. GIDLE is perfect. They are the TRUE QUEENs and THE LIONS of Queendom!
=
HOLY SHI THIS WAS AMAZINGGGGG
=
I FALING LOVE AGAIN WITH THEM.......❤❤❤❤
=
THEIR COSTUMES ARE SO ON POINT. IT'S BEEN A FREAKING WHILE SINCE I'VE SEEN THIS MUCH POWER IN WOMEN'S CLOTHING
=
This song and the performance is so empowering. I tear up every time! True talent
=
I'm still crying that Cube didn't wait a few more months to debut them just so Han Chowon would have a chance of being part of the group, she would have slayed that concept x.x
=
GOOOOOOSE FREAKING BUMPS MAN
=
I don’t care I want the exact dress costume chair dancer their hair style the beat without any remix just the exact performance on MAMA OR ANY OTHER END YEAR PERFORMANCE!! Thanks gidle! You girls the best!
=
Indeed queens!
=
I really love this concept.
=
*The Queen's Royal Welcome*
=
Just one thing : love the song, love the concept, love the girls, love the performance, but the intro... As a writer (and even as just a person enjoying fiction), it was terrible to listen to. Poor story, cheesy, you can see where it's going to go and it doesn't add anything to the performance (just made me cringe a lot before it actually started)
=
=
I think Soyeon wanted to make this Shuhuas moments since it’s the first time she got a big line
=
Great show! 
=
Wow! These outfits 
=
when the rest of them walked out i died
=
Superior era
