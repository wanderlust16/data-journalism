When you see those korean comments getting 5k likes but you don’t understand a single word
=
I'm sad international fans don't appreciate secret garden cause they're not doing girl crush. Like fudge, it has better vocals than most songs.
=
I loved how they stood true to their concept throughout the whole show instead of being something their not. It just shows how talented they are and how they just have to put a little twist to it and it still rocks
=
Secret garden lyrics refer to planting seeds of hope in you, planting seeds full of dreams. *And even if not a lot of people see it yet, you know someday people will see the secret garden blooming in you, basically the dreams you have with you.* In the lyrics they say that you have to wait a little, they're still showing their secret garden to a few people first but someday it'll be fully realized as they keep dreaming.
This is also the first song that gave Oh My Girl their first win. 
I also love that it's fully in Korean. It sounds such a pretty song.
=
Do you understand how stunning you have to be for Seolhyun, who's a whole supermodel in her own right, to see you and spontaneously go "WOW".
That's our YooA.
=
Honestly, this song could be interpreted in so many different ways. BUT FOR ME, oh my girl is like a secret garden in kpop. They're underrated but once you know them and watch a little more, you'd realize how special they truly are.
Plus, I feel like the meaning of this song means a lot to Oh my girl
=
seriously..OMG is the only girl group that made me can't differentiate who is the main vocal, lead vocal and sub vocal..
=
BASED ON THE COMMENTS HERE I THINK THEY ARE DOING FINE IN KOREA , INTERNATIONAL FANS MUST KNOW THIS GROUPs EXISTENCE . ❤
=
it's like you can tell the popularity of a group by the comments, for omg it's mostly korean but for gidle it's mostly international
=
they turned secret garden into a full on DISNEY SONG
=
Mr remove always loses it's job to oh my girl.......
=
This was honestly so refreshing to watch. I was surprised. That's why I was surprised other groups rated the performance so low.
=
Please I need this re-arranged version of Secret Garden on Spotify
=
I have never seen such beautiful performance, I dont like cute girl concepts , but this one is cute refreshing peaceful  fairytale calming beautiful , brings out new color of kpop . i watch this everyday❤
=
I can’t stop rewatching this moment 0:23 
I’m falling in love with YooA
=
0:23 reply button, youre welcome.
=
After this performance I'm officially a fan! What a graceful and beautiful performance. Love them!
=
yooA has big eyes and big lips and small head,thats why she's cute
=
I wish they did "Closer".. that's the song that made me stan them..
=
I'm sorry Oh My Girl, I just recognize you after join Queendom
=
Oh God im sooo happy my fairy princess' finally got recognized in this show T_T this beautiful performance were just like they always did for comebcak stage: beautiful, calming like a fairy tale T_T
=
3:01 Hwasa's confused face and wheein's serious face after that LOL
=
This song made me walk into this magical place where there’s a beautiful magical garden and space.
=
i really love that they still perform with pure sweetness of girls and not trying the badass concept....  this is seriously beautiful and sweet and just  ahhhhhhhhh
=
secret garden is that song ladies and gentleman T_T so good
=
Seunghee's voice is so much richer live than it is autotuned.
=
OH MY GIRL IS REALLY KILLING IT! THEY OWN QUEENDOM AND I'M NOT COMPLAINING! 
=
0:24 she looks like a mermaid
=
Looking at the comments make me rest assured, Oh My Girls be doing good in Korea ❤❤❤

=
It's already an MR REMOVED  . .Oh My Girl's vocal is really amazing ❤
=
oh my girl's songs makes my heart ache for some reason. their performances are always magical 
=
This is basically mr removed. Their vocals are very on point. I am speechless.
=
This performance is so warm. I'm in love
=
It's so mind cleansing. I feel so relaxed after watching this. 
=
Wheein gives me life with her reactions!
=
this is the best version of Secret Garden ever! And im shocked by Arin's ethereal beauty every time she appears... 
Was wondering why Moonbyul seemed especially excited for OMG, and then I realized she and Yooa became close thanks to Idol Drama Operation Team.
=
0:41 *Remember everyone, this is the same girl that pulled down Mimi's pants during a vlive* 
2:15 *This is also the same leader that almost spilled their dorm's wifi password during a vlive* 
=
Welcome to OHMYGIRL's SECRET GARDEN
Secret Garden with SSFWL style arrangement
Concept Fairies 
=
yet, this performance of OH MY GIRL's Secret Garden makes me relax and happy...and i dont know why...
=
I love how all the other groups love their performance
=
Amazing.!!! So stable.! This is why we all love them so so so so so so much.! ❤️❤️♥️♥️
=
1:25 so no one is gonna talk about how moonbyul knows the lyrics?
=
Wow!!! This is so beautiful!!! I love their performance!!
=
This is so amazing omgggg
=
This song is too beautiful
=
My favorite idol kpop group nowww 
INTERNATIONAL FANS

=
My fav girlgroup 3rd generation.. Oh my girl..
Arin so beautiful.. Why she is not the visual of omg?
She remind me a lot with juyeon of After School
=
Jiho smile such a happy virus..
=
0:23 Guys, she is my bias ❤️
=
National girl group vibe they so beautiful and talented 
=
HERMOSO ♡
=
The first song I listened to from OMGirl was actually The Fifth Season... but the amount of sentiment I can feel from their performance strangely makes me want to cry so much... the way it’s sung just feels so sincere and weirdly enough I pictured a person calling to their lover in a open field even though they’re miles away, separated by ocean, vowing to wait and continue to love them. (It’s a bit odd... but I hope the feeling makes sense?)
=
The Mamamoo members’ reactions are priceless 
=
0:21 welcome
=
Secret Garden is the song that made me fall in love with Oh My Girl. It's one of their best songs yet, and one of the best songs of 2018. Their performances are always so beautiful. 
=
I feel like watching they performs "Disney" - like song
=
1:28 moonbyul sing OMG 
Btw i came here because they wear hanbook in this song
=
Just me or... The audiences so handsome
=
mamamoo - this make me happy
me- i wanna cry so bad 
=
This song really gives me christmas feels❤
=
I hope they can go international.
=
I’m glad i know these girls now... they deserve better
=
Oh my girl might not shake the stage with powerful concept, but no one can defeat them in dream-like concept like this. They are powerful enough already
=
if you love them, you can see my playlist to see more oh my girl content!
=
i think i fell in love with this girl YooA
=
Wait so many produce trainee there ?
=
Their performance is lovely and pure, i loved it
=
Miracles our girls did so well <3
=
Wow this is so simple yet so beautiful ❤ 
=
2:02 oawwww Baekjin 
=
As performances do oh my girl e de tirar o fôlego
=
They should have a more colourful dress for this awesome song!
=
Choi Arin, don't grow up too fast
=
Wheein and Hwasa are hilarious hhahahah
=
The English comment u r finding
=
Ko aku sedih sih liatnya , aku ngerasa kaya mereka tu berhasil ngelewatin masa masa sulit selama dibindustri k pop
=
Where i can find this official audio?? I like this song :”) please tell meeeeeee
=
wowww arin is so beautifullll
=
Yes 3M ❤️
=
Start with ribbon, end with strong ropes ❤️
=
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL OMG MY FAV
=
YooA at the beginning... 
=
This reminds me of fantasy films. God I love it please release a studio version
=
Arin Jiho, well performance
=
they look like Disney Princess, i love that version.
=
0:59 is it just me or is that Jisoo???
=
WAAAAAAAAA!!!!! Beautiful!
=
0:20 saved
=
Look at their precise movement
=
Support OhMyGirl because they are having the purest heart 
=
I’m from Malaysia I like OMG very much.
=
Waaaa so pretty!
=
somehow reminds me of apink ❤
fighting omg 
=
i cried after listening to this arrangement. memories flashes back, their debut showcase, their first mini fanmeeting, the first time nominated in the music shows, jine went hiatus twice, their struggles, their first win... the recognition they now finally got... i am very proud of oh my girl. this song motivated me to never give up as well, thank you oh my girl for not giving up.
=
Arin 
=
What's more important than the eventual rankings and votes is OMG gaining new fans, exposure and interest in them as a group, translating to more sales and success guys. Let's keep repping our fairies, Miracles fighting!!
=
They own the concept. They don't need to try to be someone else.
=
0:59 who is this audience girl?
=
So amazing... i feel like i’m in heaven...
=
No wonder even 3 other team below vote them, but the on site voter realize that this is really OMG color and still a good performance.
So peaceful and heartwarming ❤️
=
OH MY GIRL don't need be a badass and sexy girl to attract attention...they're already have their own concepts is called Magical Fairytale
=
@1:57-2:04 is that Sihoon and Baekjin?! 
=
I realize Oh My Girl just need to be themselves
They have their own concept, no need to be strong, cool or sexy, girlcrush . Oh My Girl is unique
=
IT'S SO VISUALLY PLEASING AND ENJOYING TO WATCH!! IT'S SO PRETTY!! I don’t know what kind of song this is but I feel like if the colors of their clothes were in lighter colored pastels, this performance would soar out of the universe!
=
So peacfull and silent :)))
=
is no one gonna talk about How Hwasa Look at her Member Serious cuz she was singing Made me Laugh LMAO 3:01
=
0:21 that was absolutely beautiful... the look on that girls face was like she just saw a goddess
=
This us why IU likes them.  And Twice, EXID,  and other idol groups
=
แพคจินกะชีฮุนดีมากกกกกกกก หล่อม๊ากกกกกคนอื่นก็หล่อนะ5555
=
0:21♥♥
=
that wheein and hwasa moment!!
=
In the term of singing (in this show) , I think they did a good job. Just because they didn't do girl crush thing, doesn't mean they are weak. They just stick to their fairy concept, that the point.
=
I almost cried. Almoost. Never felt like this with a kpop girl group before.. This is sooo good. Going to stan this group more. So perfect.
=
3:00 wheein cant press her innocent girly side anymore lol
=
Bring on them disney vibes !!
=
Oh My Girl me enamora cada día más
=
y'all can say that oh my girl is boring but they still got 3rd place despite getting 3 down votes lmao stay pressed luv 
=
1:56 can someone tell me the name of the guy. It's for my thesis. Thanks a lot.
=
Ohmygirl deserve a credit for keeping this song so original. Their performance depends on their beautiful choreo and clear singing voice. Most other group depend on too many remix to gave more impact. Meanwhile omg just keep being original and already blow people away.
=
1:56 BDC??
=
3:00
?
=
Damn, why did it took me this long to actually watch a performance of Oh My Girl???? Why did I sleep on this talent?
=
刷一波❤️❤️
=
2:38
3:34
=
Love the performance, their concept is my fav in Queendom. Anw, I'm desperate for an English comment on this vid...
=
3:00 
=
0:21 0:21
0:21 0:21
=
So cheerful
=
Even in black dresses Oh My Girl are looking like angels 
=
yooa is such a special girl, her face is beyond angelical, her expressions are so unique and authentic
*i'm in love*
=
please release stidio ver...
=
Was that kim sihun...
=
god i really hope they’ll perform closer at one point
=
Wish lovelyz made a cover of secret garden!!
=
I dont really follow oh my girls. But this song really make me calm and i dont know why im tearing.
=
JEEZ THER REALLY DESERVE MORE RECOGNITION!1!1!!!1!1!!!1!!!1!!
=
Yooa perfect and dance vocal visual facial expresion
=
right off from the start, it feels like Disney princesses are dancing and the world is dazzling
=
1:57 who?
=
Yes this song is indeed refreshing to my ears and eyes they'r too pretty
=
THIS SONG IS BEAUTIFUL!!! It's like a peaceful musical
=
nice arrangement of the song
=
It looks like from a disney princess story!!
=
Their performance actually give me the most goose bump!!! It shocked me!!!
They definitely can do Disney songs!! It’s gonna be hit!!!
=
they literally invented fairy concept
=
Simply magical ⚘
=
1:02
=
Why does the guy at 4:15 look like he just met his soulmate and fell in love...I don’t know what he’s feeling but...I felt that.
=
1:57 I feel like I know the guy, but who?
=
who is that boy watching
=
3:02 hwasa priceless face omg  she's so done with wheein
=
Eat CD  oh my girl jjang!
=
If only their team management choose more bright color I think it will be good. The song and their perfomance is great! It remind me with Disney song. Their outfit design suit with beautiful princess theme. If only the color not black :(
=
yooa is so pretty i'm
=
beautiful dolls
=
This performance is so damn pretty like everything about this is pretty .angelic voices <3
=
I started watching Queendom for my mamamoo girls, but also fell for OMG ❤️ I normally don’t like the innocent/cutesy themes, but OMG takes me into a fairytale AND they all can sing!
=
Thankyou queendom for introducing those beautiful girl to me! So much loveeee!!! XOXO
=
The best i've ever seen in the world
=
THE OFFICIAL AUDIO MUST BE DROPPED!!!!!
=
1:57 PRODUCE X 101 right?
=
For some reason this version made me think of a Pokémon song lol.
=
OMG PDX101 TRAINEES ARE THERE
=
So soft and adorable.. and there's me became omg fan after watched their performance in queendom. I never pay attention on them before this lol
=
It's totally interesting and refreshing, that Oh My Girl stay being themselves with Pure, Innocent and Fairy concepts. While the others bringing this "Sexy" and "Girlcrush" concept. I thought they wouldn't get good result but being the 3rd is a very great start for them! ❤
=
Their concept really no joke they deserve more than this TT
=
0:20 to 0:25 that face? She knows how to deceive people tha she's a real fairy. 
=
2:03 is that Baek Jin from PDX101 from Vine ENT?
=
OHMYGIRL's songs always have this mystical feeling. Not gonna lie, I was hoping for them to sing Closer (love this song the most)
=
I can't believe Seunghee just did THAT while dancing at the same time, her voice is angelic
=
Only intellectuals will know how great this song is. Oh My Girl Forever~
=
It makes me really said reading comments about how they didn't deserve 3rd place...like why? Just because they didn't change so much it means they didn't work hard? Just because it's a soft, fairytale type of concept it means they aren't as talented as the other groups?? Just look at that dance,how they slayed that.. and you can hear how amazing their vocals are- so powerful!! 
Oh My Girl just put everyone in a trance with this stage, it's ethereal and magical and nobody can do that style like OMG!!!
=
00:41
=
Nobody can win against oh my girls talent, gorgeousness, dance, vocal, visuals. They are born as angels. Their bond is the strongest. Again such goosebumps. And seunghees high note as she was still dancing. Oh my girl has never disappointed. And never will. They aren't only a "cutesy girl group" they are far more than that. Stan oh my girl. A proud miracle.
=
I so love Oh My Girl and Fairy Crush concept 
=
1:36 ‍♀️
=
Gold color hair boy so cute
=
3.2 million views for this is unfair.
=
One of the best groups around. All the members have natural Korean beauty and are super talented.
The stage is their home. 'Oh My Girl' is a class act. They are going to get better and better with every performance. You can see the admiration on the faces of the competitors.
=
This version was so beautiful !!, I remember thinker bell when i hear the intro.
=
Crying seriously, their performances are always making me tear up and it's seriously so good. Give me chills in a good way T____T I'm a happy miracle!!!
=
It's so beautiful. Oh my girl fighting 
=
4:14 this boy looks familiar
=
they really own this concept <3
=
They are amazing
=
Intro dia je dah nice. Love from Malaysia 
=
Jiho looks like Rosé here
=
1:56 anyone else notice Sihun and Seongjun from Produce X 101??
=
Its so beautiful.. i so amazed with this performance
=
This song always makes me cry... OMG ❤️
=
WHEEEEEEIN
=
I'm not even a fan but I have to say they have such nice vocals!
=
They rank 4 brand reputation in September
=
looks like an anime, not even real 
=
If there's a confetti after the blackout during Seunghee's part that  would be perfect. I can feel the vibes of dreamy, fantasy, ethereal and mystical aura that only OH MY GIRL could produce
=
moonbyul as a supportive OMMAA
=
Moonbyul singing along with OMG is such a mood
=
um like each and every member just shined. i. am. still. speechless. 

*THIS WAS SUCH A MAGICAL PERFORMANCE*
=
The way Seunghee never stops doing the choreo while hitting highnotes is a real Queen energy
=
I see u ONFwhat a good junior that being a supportive family
=
It’s funny how they got voted as the weakest but they’re literally the only one that piqued my interest this much when watching their performance. Legit enchanted.
=
idk but my opinion, i think omg is gg full with visual  they are   really pretty  stan them guys
=
Queens!
=
2:23 Wheein: "This makes me happy" ( *VERY SERIOUS FACE* ) 
=
STUDIO VERSION PLEASEEEEE LADIES 
=
0:24
=
Somehow this performance made me happy inside lol.. i don't even know the name of the group
=
Hwasa, Solar and Wheein keep on praising Oh My Girl then there's Byulie having her own moment singing along 
=
1:56 whoever is you. i love you. 
=
1:55 I see Kim Si Hoon OMG  
2:03 I see red hair Baekjin!
=
1:56 sihoon is that u?
=
OH MY GIRL! FIGHTING!
=
Seunghee's part gives me goosebumps everytime
=
Hah~~~ This really put me in a good mood!☺️✨
=
1:57 hi sihun
=
Yoaa is soo cute ..she's my girlll
=
Im  going to stann oh my girl bc of seunghee's friendship between bts jimin and v and their concepts is so beutiful that looks like a fairytale
=
I’m so glad they ended up getting 3rd in this round. Y’all don’t know how much I cried watching everyone write that they were below them. I support all the groups on this show and in no way am I hating (because it’s just a show and they didn’t have an option it’s not their fault) still it hurt seeing them put in that position to the point that Hyojung cried. Our underrated queens will reign one day! 
=
This makes me so happyyy they’re so cute omg
=
Bangga lahh ngikutin dari awal debut sampe sekarang sama kayaaa b1a4 dulu walaupun awalnya gk begitu diperhintungin tapi lama2 mereka berkembang dan bener bikin semua kagum 
=
oh my girl is seriously unique in kpop, every performance i watch i feel so moved and at peace. they are magical.
=
I miss this song 
=
Their vocals are insane. They didn't even change the OG song much.
=
Mnet quickly release the no cut and fancam versions. Your choice of reaction shots and camera work are shoddy as usual
=
They are all so pretty but Arin and YooA are like god-tier visuals wow Theirs are healing visuals, almost reminds me of Yoona
=
Oh My Girl can really be even bigger. They are amazing
=
Magical/Ethereal/Fairy/Disney songs for new fans :

Fairy Crush songs for new fans :
Checkmate, Knock Knock, Crime Scene, Remember Me, Twilight.
Quirky/Fun/Dorky songs for new fans :

=
I appreciate this show for exposing me to the music of groups I wasn't that familiar with llike "Oh My Girl" and "Lovelyz".  But while I enjoy watching the groups performances and their preparation for their song, the rest of the show is just ok.  The whole part of interviewing each group and asking them where they think they will place is pretty boring.
=
My heart is beating so hard esp when jiho's ending line TT
=
I love that they kept their concept
=
it's so cute because it looks like oh my girl are fairies and g idle are witches
=
I think oh my girl can be big soon. All of them can sing, dance, and have visuals too. I'm not a fan but they're such a talented group
=
their concept and stage presence is so elegant im in love
=
Please,,name song 
=
Felt I was watching an oh my girl musical concert instead of a competition stage!! So artistic my goodness!! They really did so well!! ❤️ more power to you Queens
=
Oh My Girl never fails to impress us with such fairytale concepts. They deserve recognition with their overloaded talents. ☺☺☺
=
THEY LITERALLY LOOK LIKE ANGELS HOW CAN SOMEONE FEEL LIKE SERENITY & SUMMER RAAAAIN im gay
=
yep. that's it. 
oh my girl are literal goddesses sent from heaven and you can't change my mind.
=
please appreciate them and give love to my girls! they are angels and really, really talented.
=
0:24 same, Seolhyun, same))

=
Omg MiMi
=
0:20 i love that part very much! I need it a loop
=
WM PLEASE DROP THE STUDIO VERSION!!!!
=
i got goosebumps just from the intro
=

=
Oh my god.
=
YooA looks gorgeous I'm that close to cry :<
=
is this a mr. removed? their voices are so clean and clear
=
Moonbyul as supportive eomma to yooA
=
I never heard their music before but it's so nice! Their voice twinkles like in a fairytale 
=
i liked this perf a lot i felt bad when i saw that they were picked by 3 teams as the team that was below them on that self evaluation :(
=
I think OMG gained another girl group fans in Queendom~
=
"So pretty.."
"cute"
"WOW"
"OHMYGIRL!!"
"YOOA" 
=
Honestly I want Oh My Girl to stick in this kind concept bcus its so refreshing to listen. They dont need girl grush concept❤❤
=
Yooa so freaking beautiful, i can't
=
WM ARTIST SO UNDERRATED PLEASE SUPPORT B1A4, OH MY GIRL AND ONF PLEASEE❤
=
They could be Disney's princesses omg so lovely and magical
=
3:00 wheein  look at hwasa’s reaction 
=
They are like fairies!
=
0:33 she just killed me with that smile
=
wheein: 'This makes me happy'
*ACTUALLY DYING INSIDE*
=
OMG almost took over 1500 days to get their first win. Please love them, they are so talented, and they are the most slept on group.
=
I feel as though I just intruded on the fairies’ secret ritual
=
Can they release a studio ver of this??? I like it way much more than the original
=
i really like secret garden this version, really gave more magical feeling than the original version.
=
I NEED THE STUDIO VERSION! THIS IS SO GOOD!!
=
this is the song that made me stan them, it really calms my nerves for some reason
=
This video has make me stan this girls! I only listened to Liar Liar and I loved it, but never heard another song forom them. Now Im glad I can say that Iistened to more songs. They have beautiful songs and they always eat their cd in live performances. This is a group to stand! 

PD: sorry if I made any mistake, I speak spanish haha :D
=
Dont worry those who want crush concept these precious girls will do that soon they just teasing us
=
i have watched this like 12 times and never get tired of it.  i have always been a fan of omg.

=
they are fairies q-q this was magical
=
Arin is too pretty  She also has actress's visual and vibe 
=
i don't know why i cried when i was hearing their voice
=
I have to say this. Last week, I thought  that other groups had no chance to compete with MAMAMOO and Park Bom. However, OMG's performance has proved that I was wrong. I am a MOOMOO, but I am astonished by Oh My Girl's stage. Elegant, majestic but also peaceful. Their performance has delivered happiness and coziness which has warmed my heart. I am glad seeing this high level performance and hope Oh My Girl can be more popular after the show.
=
Coming back here waiting for their second stageeee
=
OH MY GIRL - SECRET GARDEN is the best performance. Please vote for OH MY GIRL, Korean Mircle!
=
This is a whole new level performance of Oh My Girl, so magical~

Yooa is giving me LIFE

Dear Oh My Girl, 
I just want to say that:
“I pray no tears in your dreams, I know you’ll fly high in your life” - B1A4 (Only One) 
=
"They are making me feel peaceful" "It feels like Christmas" This literally me when I 1st heard it.....THEY'RE LIKE ANGELS
=
they performed this song so many times and im still getting goosebumps 
=
Goosebumps are spreading everywhere I am so proud of them
=
congrats for the 3rd place, in spite of being downvoted 3 TIMES!! They recognized you guys as a competitor
NB : THIS ORCHESTRA VERSION IS LIT! THE FLUTE PART IS HEAVEN
Its 3 times guys, i just rewatched it
=
the english comment youre finding!
=
can they release a studio version for this arrangement  it's so fairytale and refreshing and their visuals!!!!!!!
=
01:25
=
I don't know why but the first few seconds I cried. It was such a beautiful amazing by oh my girl
=
Never seen or heard them. But they are fairies. They dont even need a fairies concept. They are fairies. All of them are cute and pretty and their dance also elegance like fairies is. Fall in love at first sight
=
This was amazing, I've always known about oh my girl but never truly put in the effort to stan... I was wrong, truly wrong. they deserved to win in my eyes
=
The Opening is freaking fabulous. With the grace of the oriental goddess. 
Look YooA, fairy maiden absolutely.
=
Please please please release the studio version of this, both instrumental and with vocals, I'm too in love!!! <3
=
guess what I keep repeating this video more than their MV 
=
This was my favourite one❤️. I was so upset when they got voted below 3 times
=
I always check this video, and finally got 2M viewers ✨
=
I see nayoung pd48 :')
=
Her eyes look so beuatiful
=
I think they did so well. Very elegant. The emotion. I wasnt surprised their rank was high.
=
I don’t understand why they’re chose black outfits feels like in funeral ⚰️
=
3:01 Lol
=
I got goosebumps omg
=
I’ve been trying to find out who jiho looks like, it’s rosè!!!
=
3:02-3:05 Hwasa was like ehmmm girl are you okay ? 
=
I keep coming back here.
=
this performance gives me goosebumps
=
This performance makes me cry  this is so mesmerizing 
=
Y'all STAN THESE FAIRIES GIRLS
=
I became their fan after watching queendom  What’s the name of the girl in :34 and the girl at 3:22? How come I never heard of their group and songs before ( I PLAYED THIS SONG 100x ALREADY )
=
i found sihyun ^^
=
i just smiled thoughout the entire perfomance, i couldn't look away for even a second, it's mesmerizing.
=
Im inlove with themmm!!!! Love it btw the boys at 1:57 and 2:03 .. they from pdx101 trainee right?? If im not mistaken i saw kim sihoon im just shocked everytime camera went to see audience reaction.. always saw them..
=
just see that the audiences from produce x 101 participants....wow...
that's why...how the audience was so handsome....
=
Their voices are so pure and clear ❤
=
i wish they did closer too
=
0:40 she reminds me of rosé, maybe because of her hair i think
=
Hahaha Wheein why did you do that. From  to 
=
yooa is such a doll 
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
3:07
=
Merinding deh gue. Ayu2 amat Hahaha
=
so nobody's going to say anything about mimi?? she's so stunning in this stage!!
=
Honestly, I love their stage the most, so elegant and dreamy.
=
You can hear their voices loud and clear.. You can feel the song! They deserve so much more 
=
jiho looks like rose with that hairstyleeee
=
Yooa's beauty is so ethereal here especially that intro when she had a close up omg 
=
Disney princess??
=
That Yooa's first close up scene can win this show easily
=
i'm glad they got 3rd place, i dont usually like girlish concept but their performance really beautiful. especially their hand gesture in the opening. i got goosebump watching it.
=
this made me choke a bit, idk why it's just so beautiful. the song, the mood, the vocals, the visual, everything is just so right, for me this is the most beautiful yet strong stage on queendom.
=
OHMYGIRL is just too perfect for me, for you, for the world!
=
Their vocals, their choreo, their outfits, their stage presence... Everything is perfect.
=
This was an amazing arrangement. Their vocals shined and they danced like ballerinas. They are a fantastic gg and definitely one of my top 5.
=
I really like Oh my Girl, if others use the concept of sexy but different from them, they use the concept according to them beautiful fresh girls I love you my girls
=
This feels like they come out from a fairytale book and spread pixie dust everywhere!!!
=
i watch queendom bcos of Park Bom but then i think i fall in love with Oh My Girl.. this is such a beautiful song !!!
=
 For some who started to say not so good things about girl crush concepts and for others who think Oh My Girl does not do girl crush concept. Please do know that "Remember Me" was made by Oh My Girl to have a girl crush concept(Bubbly Girl Crush - Hyojung said) and also one of their best title songs 
=
Oh My Girl owns this concept!!!!
=
1:56 my adorable sihun
=
queen of peace ❤️ they are very peaceful ❤️
=
好想跟 arin 一起牽紅線 ❤️❤️❤️
=
I started stanning OMG like three days ago and I think I learned their names too fast.. stan oh my girl
=
So beautiful❤
=
Beautiful!!
=
Can they do closer as well
=
The fairies did it again 
=
so so so beautiful tho i wish there would be smth more w the ribbon
=
3:00 is no one really gonna talk about wheein and hwasa????
=
i love they stay true to themselves!!
=
Beautiful
=
Jiho so beautifull , her long blonde hair remember me of rose blackpink 
=
This made me cry remembering that this was their 1st song that made them win
=
Moon byul is so cute, it's like she's fangirling with OMG
=
Oh my girl is their own concept also i always want to cry to this song
=
This stage is healing
=
"this song make me feel peaceful" i agree because i feel the same too
=
Jiho's smile look alike rose's smile
=
Lo hacen todo con tanta elegancia y perfección 
=
Such a pretty song
=
when Wheein was singing to OMG and Hwasa was  like "no please" LMAOOO
=
0:23
=
I love this!!!!!!  Im happy that Oh My Girl joined this!  They're so pretty!!!!!  I love this waaaaah
=
This is different from the others. It’s really pure, I’m getting goosebumps.
=
I loved this song ever since their release, one of my favorites like I really mean it. And this rearranged version is like an upgraded angelic and fairy version, it is so so so beautiful that I subconsciously get teary eyes while watching and listening to them performing. Go OMG
=
Oh My Girl enchanting us all with their vocals and visuals 
=
why they're so good 
=
OH MY GOOD❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I love them my queens 
=
*2M we're cominggggg!*
=
I'm crying and getting several goosebumps through this performance. I hope everyone will realize how talented and great Oh My Girl is. Been a fan since Closer era
I'm actually mad at the final result of voting cause people slept on for too long
Please everyone stan these beautiful girls
=
Seunghee voice so good
=
YooA❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
So pretty !
=
GHAD ALL OF THEM ARE FREAKING BEAUTIFUL
=
i love it omg
=
why I remember tinkerbell series when listening this song?:')))
=
someone send me an acapella of this song, I think I can listen to their voices all day on repeat without getting sick of it.
=
I dont listening omg songs and dont know their songs. but how can them sang the song so peacefully? Members looks so natural without over expression. So glad to watch this and poor me to late know them
=
Excited Moonbyul is me 
=
Woahhh seunghee’s high notes though
=
They are so hardworking gonna stan them
=
I  hope they wore bright outfit
=
They sang beautifully. I'm so proud of them!
=
I hope they will release clean audio for this version. I really like it. By the way jiho is look so beautiful. She look like rosè somehow 
=
I saw my bias from PDX101
=
1:56 Kim Si Hoon produceX101 right????
=
Actually I really like this stage , when I listen to their song it made me feel calm
=
0:21 I'm mesmerized.
- Moomoo -
=
I don't know much about them but damn , their concept is like an ost to a Disney Movie . It's so Dreamy ❤️
=
They're so talented, my concept fairies doing amazing as always 
=
I LOVE HOW MIM CHANGED HER FAIRY POSE AT 3:43

I LOVE OH MY GIRL
THANK YOU MNET AND WM ENTERTAINMENT 
=
The main reason I stan oh my girl is cause their songs take me to a dreamland in an other dimension
=
1. Gidle
2. Mamamoo
3. Oh My Girl
4. AOA
5/6. Park Bom/ Lovelyz


this is the rankings for this week.

Team Up @ Change Concept
Gidle x Park Bom
Mamamoo X AOA
Lovelyz X Oh My Girl!

I'm confius whether they change concept with another group or collab with another group, but what i've seen they can pick which idol they want to work for. 

I've watch streaming in Russian web, but cannot literally understand what they said, because they no sub. i wish i'm korean.
=
I prefer them than lovelyz tbh :'''
The other were right, there's something calming when hearing this :)
Love from Elvis :'D
=
MY FAVOURITE SONG I JUST CANT. TOO MUCH PERFECTION
=
honestly every of omg’s performances are never dull and always so mesmerising because of their stage presence & the beautiful choreo. and yooa in that dress, wow 
=
3:00
=
Do you guys notice some of producex101 trainees?
=
please don‘t sleep on Oh My Girl Please I beg y‘all 
=
Beautiful
=
I support Oh my girl cause the friendship between Seulgi I get to know them thanks to Seulgi and I also like this song Secret Garden  it’s gaves me goosebumps
=
00:21
=
In my opinion, this is the best perfomance in the show
=
I came back after watching MAMA. can't believe that queendom performances were sooo much better than this year's MAMA. Let alone topping this performance. Oh My Girl should be there to show how to perform. Oh My Girl deserves better.
=
OMG approves that they don't need to have a girl crush concept to be a powerful girlgroup.
=
I actually think that this Queendom competition was smart, although at first many fans speculated that it was unfair to the other “unpopular” groups such as: Lovelyz and Oh My Girl ! That competing to other more known girl groups like Mamamoo and (G)-Idle. But I think that this competition opened up the eyes of fans that weren’t actually fans to those unknown groups. Like me for example, I did not even hear about Oh My Girl before but now I have become a huge fan of them, I mainly started watching Queendom for Mamamoo and (G)-Idle however now, am more than impressed and fascinated by Oh My Girl, AoA, and Lovelyz, the rest of the contestants as well. So seeing this as a good side that they decided to mix up groups. Like myself, am pretty sure there are a lot of new fans added while they were exposed to these groups that they did not know of before. 
Am so glad am part of Oh My Girl’s fandom now 
=
For me, this is the best stage performance of *2019*
=
that rapper has one of the coolest entrances not to mention her voice is actually good.
=
arin looked like she belonged in a historical drama
=
Hopefully oh my girl will be back with songs like this or like Secret Garden, closer.
=
I still think this is the best performance in Queendom.
=
I felt they were geniuses. I think they saved the beauty of Korea. I was so immersed. My heart breaks. How did others see this stage?
=
After Twilight Perfomance ??

=
They really owned the song. Their  interpretation is very much like an Oh My Girl song.
=
After watching all MAMA stages...
OMG Destiny > MAMA
=
1:38 Jiho's wink tho
=
As an American I never thought I would like this but I dont even know what they are saying and its making me cry and come back..
=
Jiho has a huge actress vibe. She should be casted for drama. I can see her being versatile actress.
=
I'm not their fan, but I'm so proud of them and it makes me wanna cry everytime i watch their performance! TT
=
This is when I fell in love with OMG. I honestly didn’t have an opinion of them before because I’m not into the sweet, cute concept and they debuted with other groups that had similar concepts. But now I’m a fan.
Even though I watched Queendom for Mamamoo and g-idle I think OMG really showed their colors and benefitted the most from this show.
=
Better than the original, to be honest 
=
Many Miracles praise Oh My Girl for not having any bad songs. And for cover songs Oh My Girl had always made sure (aside from making it Oh My Girl style) it's always something they can be proud of to show everyone. They had some losses on cover competitions but they never gave up on their identity, instead of changing it, they grow with it. Destiny is a combination of all those experiences which I was wishing Lovelyz would also have. When Seunghee said "I want to let people feel this song as Oh My Girl song", this is what I meant.
=
The best performance on queendom ever
=
This sounds and look like actual Korean PoP. It has so many Korean traditional themes in it. Absolutely incredible perfomance!
=
i dont think i'll ever get tired of this
=
This performance has more views than Original Destiny MV on Woolim's YT, Oh My Girl really killed it!
=
I have watched this more than 10 times but still got goosebumps
=
I REALLY LOVE BINNIE'S VOCAL, AT FIRST I THOUGHT SHE IS MAIN VOCAL
=
Who is the one who has awesome vocal? Oh... no...indeed all of them sing really well
Perfect package OMG
=
Mnet really owed us a full cam for this legendary stage. Maybe mnet should invite oh my girl to mama again this year and let them perform two songs on their own. Then they owe us nothing. Deal?
=
Just to remind everyone this performance got 1st place in round 2 of Queendom for a reason 
Don’t sleep on Oh My Girl anymore please
=
They should include  YooA’s “ending fairy” scene here 
She is so pretty at the end
=
Imagine them dancing in a water, that would be perfect....
=
Secret Garden introduced me to OMG. I stayed for Closer. The 5th season made me stan and Destiny made me fall in love ❤️
=
Oh My Girl pretty much went from being voted the worst in the first week to being voted the best in the second week. They didn’t realize how serious the competition was. But once they knew, they went full out.
=
Oh My Girl "Guerrilla" chart 17.00pm KST Update:
- Bugs 1
- Naver 1
- Genie 18 
- Melon 78
- Soribada 47
=
The lovelyz members be like
"We should've done that"
=
I'm almost cry when hearing this song!! It's truth!!!
=
I see this video >100 times. Amazing. I want replay, replay and replay..
=
Every group song for me is like their little daughter. Lovelyz lost their confidence after what happen with Achoo and it seems like they felt that the image of their songs is no longer that strong for this competition. Oh My Girl showed them otherwise, its was like their telling Lovelyz we're presenting to you your daughter and how amazing and more beautiful she can be, don't give up on her. That's why Mijoo looks like she's going to cry. This is just my opinion, thanks for reading ☺️
=
oh my girl is one of few groups who stays persistent to their image/sound from the very beginning up until this show. they needn't no clout whatnot to pleased the whole kpop listeners but those who follows them knows how they've prove their hardwork and perseverence after quite a long time competing with other big groups
=
It is best performance in Queendom. I like it so much althought it is sad.
=
so glad that so many ppl attracted by omg bcs of their performance in queendom and also their personalities
=
Best performance of the show. 
I fell in love with OMG after this.
=
I can't tell how much I rewatch this performance.. Its so beautiful
=
This song gave me literal chills not even kidding ✌️
=
Not going to lie I sheded some tears...okay I cried alot but my babies make me so proud
=
I watch Queendom because of MAMAMOO. Ended up being a Miracle because of this stage. I mean, I'm already listening to their songs, they were all good esp Secret Garden but this stage made me a true fan. Such talent.
=
one of the reason their stage stood out for destiny and twilight, the usage of lightings, very powerful and mesmerizing. they know how to give the exciting effect in dancebreak. i guess that is why the audience is in awe with them.
=
I like this concept and dont have too much effect on this stage. Smooth. This why we stan OH MY GIRL
=
I’m Neverland but this performance makes me into Oh My Girl so much.
=
the best oh my girl perfomance in queendom. I remember I hold my breath while watch this. comeback to youtube for rewatch this stage
=
Still the show's best performance.
=
They gave a slap to everyone in his episode ! Others (and also me at first) really underestimated them, it's good to see this performance proving it and see how we were wrong
=
Reading all these comments on how great OMG is and how they missed out on them for so long is just so . . . Touching!  Like Im legit on the brink of tears reading those comments. As I have been a miracle for around 3 years. (Not the most active member but still one) And it’s just so nice to see them get the recognition they deserve. I just remember Seunghee crying because the crowd cheered for them. And I can’t wait for them to be super popular. They have great music, are the queens of concepts, and each have such a unique and fun personality. A song of theirs will get you hooked. But them as a whole, is what makes you stay. ✨✨
=
1:37 Jiho looks so gorgeous <3 !!!
=
Omg I don't even know what they're saying but this show is so good that I've almost come to tears. Wow
=
I'm here waiting nextweek for twighlight
=
1:08 why did i think of fancy opening line- 
This definitely deserved 1st place
=
Still in love with this
=
I feel like I've been sleeping on Oh my girl for too long
=
Love how they turn this song into their own song ksksksks talentsssss
=
Oh my god. How come i just discovered this gem of a group. 
=
Oh My Girl already owned this song through their own rendition and Lovelyz has been suffered of the consequences of their own choice to not use OMG's song. 
Lovelyz was afraid their concept will be intertwined with OMG if they choose OMG's songs, but OMG wanted to challenge themselves and give their own interpretation on this song. OMG had took over Destiny from Lovelyz and that's irrefutable.
So, why people continues to hate Lovelyz further? They already learned their lessons. Only thing they can do is break their own barrier and be like OMG. Hating them because their BEG rendition is pointless!
=
This performance is just so amazing and perfect. They are so talented. ALSO THAT RAP BREAK IS SOOO COOL, it just make me fall in love with this stage over and over again.
=
WOWWW it's worth number 1 group for this challenge. Totally different from the original version.
=
Someone use this version of the song for a traditional style kdrama
=
This is art
=
This is the legendary performance of queendom for me
=
Wooo for me are the ones that deserve to be winners, evolved with each presentation and took care of every detail, presence, good dance, voice and excellent costumes but above all a lot of effort. Num 1 
=
An English comment floating through to tell you that Oh My Girl DID THAT!!!
=
I just discovered Jiho's beauty!!
=
You know what's sad? This got more views then the original mv
=
Legendary performance 
=
They DESERVE the 1st tittle! This has to be the saddest yet beautiful performance i've watched. They're so elegant and beautiful im crying
=
This is the art. Art of perfection. Damn I am so in love with this performance.
=
Can you imagine this performance on the MAMA stage? I already have goosebumps but it would be one of the greatest performance’s in KPOP history on a stage that big with fog
=
I think, cause Oh my girl and lovelyz has some “look-alike” from their debut until now. And this song is like oh my girl song, i think when I heard the original destiny is “look-alike” in fairy tale too, the instrument, the beat, the rhythm and anything in this song is like fairytale song, that’s why this song is fit with oh my girl too. Both of them as same “look-alike” but they have their own colours. That’s my opinion 
=
Still one of my favorite performances in Queendom..  and still getting a goosebumps everytime i watched it.. ♥
=
this is the best female group performance ive seen so far
=
Cant get over it until still every time I watch it gooseeebumps wew MAMA2019 will not be complete without this special stage ❤️
=
oh my.. they totally own the song!!
=
I'm sorry Oh My Girl, I just recognize you after join Queendom.
=
Watched Queendom just for Mamamoo and (G)-idle
Me after Queendom: in love with OH MY GIRL, Lovelyz and AOA
=
THIS IS AMAZING PERFORMANCE!!
AND I LOVE IT SO MUCH
THANKYOU FOR SHOWING US YOUR BEST TALENT. OH MY GIRL DAEBAK!!!!
Regard from 
=
Wow really the heartbreak song.. I love u oh my girls.. Thanks for sing lovelyz song..
Safe natural girls, safe talent, no plastic surgery.. 1000% i love oh my girls
=
This made me a fan. Tbh, I only watched Queendom for my faves but after watching the whole show, it made me fall in love with the other groups too. Especially Oh My Girl.
=
Hum mmm. Oh my girl make me forgot how destiny by Lovelyz is.
This video make me repeat to watch it
=
now I know why Seolhyun got teary eyes watching and listening to this, maybe it reminded her of her new historical drama which is SO FREAKING DOPE! called: My Country: The New Age
=
People really slept on Oh My Girl. Honestly tho, they're amazing. I also love AoA now from this show. Thank you Queendom!
=
私は日本人です！
初めてこの曲を聞き、感動しました。
今まであまり海外の曲は聞きませんでした。でも、この曲は大好きです。
特に、4:05からは最高です
これからも応援したいです
❤️
=
They may not be the best in terms of Dance, Singing or Visuals. But they make up for all of that with their sense of artistry, making up their own color of talent. Oh My Girl is the best in their own way, and now they had the chance to show that to a greater number of audience. Im happy, they're finally getting the recognition they deserve.
Im new to the fandom, only having joined since the start of the year. But once I heard one of their songs I knew that this had been the music I didnt even realize I was looking for the whole time. Oh My Girl truly is something supernatural.
=
Okay 
No matter how many times I had watched
I would still LOL when the cloth covered Hyojung
=
Still my favorite stage OMG FIGHTING
=
Omg I need the full cam for this 
=
At 3:27 I literally got goosebumps when group two visuals comes out  .....after  tht 20 seconds period the flute music woh...
=
THE BEST EVER 
=
4:53 Hyojung 
=
I know this show finish
This performance probably best 
=
BINNIE IN LONG HAIR OH MY GOD
=
wow they are so amazing, i loved oh my girl before but seeing this side of them made me admire them even more
=
I just dont get it why seunghee so suit that outfit. She just like the main actress in korean empire drama
=
back again for my daily viewing of this masterpiece
=
Can't get over of this performance. Loving it 
=
I got goosebump!! This version is really good! I love it more than the original❤️
=
I got a sequence of goosebumps from this performance.. Wahhh!
=
Ellas son tan hermosas <3
Me hacen tan orgullosa de ser Miracle
=
happy 8m oh my girl !!!
=
And seunghee & hyojung are the best vocal duo of this kpop girl group generation...
=
this is sooo good how the hell this didn't go viral!!
=
Well no offence I never heard the song before, here I really liked the way they represented the song. Wonderful job by OMG.
=
Seunghee b like: *vocal for days*
=
This is the first time i know of this group but damn that was an amazing stage. I only have little knowledge of what the song was, but it made me almost teared up. The atmosphere of their performance was too heart breaking and precious!
=
8M congratulation.
=
I fell for jiho ")
=
My life feels empty without queendom and oh my girl every thursday night 
=
3:15 Instant chills, every time. This highnote is absolutely amazing ❤
=
Best performance everrrr
=
Everytime I listen to it, it always makes me tear up.  Goosebumps everytime
=
I'm so proud of them  these performance was beautiful and i think this cover version of destiny should be made as Original Soundtrack for historical kdrama. And Arin Looks like han hyo joo here.
=
geez they are actually beening slept on this just opened my eyes. Pure talentt
=
Abit sad that OMG didnt win the first place...
=
Destiny ...... Oh my girl ....one of the best stages in my recent memories... I think they even outdid themselves with this one.
=
they really ate this up
=
The best stage performance 2019
<3 arinnnnnnnnnnnnnn
=
I WOULD DEF LISTEN TO THIS WAY MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL!!  ♡♡ THIS IS PERFECTION
=
no hate, but i think this is the biggest slap that lovelyz got for not covering OMG song.
=
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE WATCHED THIS BUT STILL HAVING A GOOSEBUMPS IN THEIR DANCE BREAK.
=
I love Oh My Girl so much ❤❤❤ stan talent
=
‪OHMYGIRL Proves that MIRACLE is another name for HARDWORK thats why our fandom name is miracle ehe ❤️‬

Wow the lyrics are amazing
The lyrics are so beautiful.
The singer is the Moon who loves the Earth, but the Earth only looks at the Sun. What a tragic.
=
I'm sorry to say but this is surpassed the original mv views on woolim channel :")

不知道为什么听了很想哭
=
Aaand I’m back here again
=
Great performance.
=
I must replay this song after Twilight :(((
=
idk why I broke down watching this
=
Love oh my girl very much
=
Personally, I love this kind of traditional pop music. The vibe it gives off is so nice. It reminds me of Shang’ri la and I just love it
=
im not even a fan but i gotta say they did very well here... it makes me feel emotional
=
This is beautiful
=
this performance proved that you don't need badass concept to look cool.
=
4:37
=
I broke the replay button
=
the cleanest and purest performance, we stan!
=
Let's watch this mv until next week 
Poor us 
=
I keep coming back for this 
=
FOR ME, THAT'S THE BEST APRESENTATION OF THE QUEENDOM EVERRRRRR.... AND I DON'T KNEW OF OH MY GIRL, AND AFTHER THESE TV SHOW... I WILL BEEN SUPER FAN.
=
Mimi ,the rap queen
=
i miss this stage 
=
Im not the only one who sees that right

=
LEGEND
=
Dios mío que acaban de ver mis ojos quedé atónita <3
=
oh my girl said MICS ON
=
i love omg
=
I've watched and listened to this so many times, but today, I really feel the longing in the song. It's moved me to tears. It's so sad. I say this as an English speaker. What a truly legendary stage. I haven't been so obsessed by a stage since 2nd gen.
=
So far this was the best stage among all stages so heart touching and elegant
=
watches this again before twilight comes for my wig. 
=
I feel like I just watcheda historical K drama turned musical, in every good way.
=
if you love them, you can see my playlist to see more oh my girl content!
=
Until the end, i forgot that this isn't even their own song...  beyond beautiful 
=
I can't stop watching this!!! Help me!!!
=
This is so greatttttttt
=
Before this, balloons and love song was my favorite cover performance from oh my girl but this is on another level!! Definitely will be my all time favorite
=
oh my girl really worked hard!
but the people who arranged the music and made it different from the original worked harder! love this version so much
=
Happy 7M Oh My Girl.
=
Perfeeect
=
Aside from knowing the results of the Units round, Im so excited to watch the Fandora round tomorrow. Twilight Version 2 Hwaitiiiiing!!! 
=
ONE OF THE BEST CANT PICK BETWEEN THIS AND AOA's EGOISTIC 
=
Its the 7th time im watching this and im still amazed by how good this performance was
=
i keep coming back to this performance. I know nothing about oh my girl but waw this was pure gold!!!!!
=
7m!!!!congrat oh my girl!
=
Omg i love this version, i love this stage, i love this grouppppppp
=
I Love​ song &​ voice so much
=
am i late to stan them?
=
4:45

I don't know her name, but I can read "Arin" in the Korean subs in the vid, so I'll just base on that  I noticed her ribbon fall off from her hair on this part. Slow it down to 0.5 or 0.25 to see it clearly 
=
wow their vocals uwu
=
Công nhận quá đỉnh luôn. Vocals, visual, dancer: 
=
Hyojung. My bias!
=
SORRY BUT THIS IS THE BEST PERFORMANCE AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE MY MIND 
=
Holy shit their vocals are underrated
=
At first I like Gidle's stage, but best stage is probably this one
=
oh my girl so won this round. proves that when music is performed by professionals, it can be transformed to something original.
=
This is the beauty of Korea
=
I AM SHOOK. I CAN'T BELIEVE I TOTALLY MISSED THIS. ONE OF MY FAVE GROUPS COVERING MY FAVE SONG FROM ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVE GROUPS.
=
this stage is so legendary
=
It just look like their own song
=
this is just so beautiful... i literally hold my breath the entire show
=
This is such a LEGEND performance
=
This is such a masterpiece. I´m in love.
=
Creativity in every performance is just beautiful
=
I bet y'all have one sad traditional Kdrama in ur mind
=
Omg the dance breakkkkkk
=
Love their outfit
=
They deserve their win for this performance, they were so awesome ♥♥♥
=
Binnie so pretty!
=
OMG the performance is great!!! this style really special~
=
Wow. I am a fan now. Its a beautiful performance. Love itttt 
=
حفيانيين !!!! من دون حذاء ☺️
=
best concept
=
*I REALLY LOVE THIS*
=
OMG 
=
Sin duda fue la mejor presentación ❤OMG no puede decepcionar. Orgulloso de pertenecer a este fandom
=
This was fire AF 
=
I like this ..
=
seungheeeeeee
=
Flaimingo is so eyes-catching
=
Wow I love them best stage for me
=
Too sad that most comments are in Korean, which mean that international fans are still sleeping on this talented 7 girls...after soo many good songs and covers, and their sense of entertainement, her they came and drop a masterpiece with a song unkown to many int fans and a new concept...and that without their main dancer...
I hope this will be the wake up call, so that Oh My Girl will always be in Kcon...
=
One word comes to mind...


Majestic.
=
arin danced so hard her damn hair came undone god bless
=
This video has more views than the original MV
=
almost a month, I still view this magical performance <3
=
They deserve the 1st
=
But the performance is real great
=
Stop sleeping for omg international fans
=
The best presentation 
=
What name of two girls at 3:30 they so pretty.
=
This is Amazing ❤️
=
2:26
=
These stages are cooler than the ones at mama lol
=
THIS IS THE BEST PERFORMANCE I HAVE EVER SEEN
=
This live is much better than the studio version.
=
infairness, Oh My Girl has all the brilliant ideas in all their Queendom performances so far...
=
Imagine jiho or arin in a historical drama as female lead. 
=
I AM: in love with this performance, they killed it, the first time i watched it i was so shocked, i can say this is the best performance in this "categories" (changing songs)
=
I really in love with binnie's voice. Her vocal colour is so good. She should get more lines. Tskk.
=
why did seolhyun looked like shes gonna cry?
=
love these  girl from day 1 on queendom
=
Deserving to be number 1!!!
=
It's cool to see Oh My Girl cover a Lovelyz song. Destiny is one of the best songs by Lovelyz. This was an amazing performance. I love the traditional vibe. It's awesome that they were able to include YooA the best they could, as she was still recovering from her injury.
=
Omg singing lovelyz adhajdh 
=
I've never paid attention to Oh My Girl before, but every time i see Seunghee sing and I see her passion and skill, I cry. I've watched this 3 times and 4:30 chokes me up every time.
=
Their voice really suit for a OST. I hope they will have their own OST soon
=
They created a performance so smoothly and naturally that I couldn't find that YooA is injured, think that she separate for purpose. Suck a clever!
I so in love with this perf. Jiho and Arin visual shock me. Love Seunghee sad expression and vocal. 
Everyone did great in this perf
=
"I wonder when the girls watched the video together did they all Laugh at the end when the white cloth fell on her head." Lol
=
GET READY COZ OUR GIRLS TURN INTO A VAMPIRE NEXT WEEK!!!!!!
=
Fairies, one of the best performance of the show so far
=
I got goosebumps whenever seunghee sing her parts 
=
Extra creativity and I'm crying wtching this huhu. I miss my destiny
=
The best stage of the year for sure... reveluv showing some support to oh my girl in queendom, amazed by you girls 
=
I love oh my girl, ot8 forever
=
This was beautiful
=
Why was Mijoo looking so sad? :/
Congratulations to OMG, I've been stanning them for some years now and I keep falling for them over and over again
=
I got chills everywhere
=
Wow,, the view,,, beats the original mv,,,
=
OMG THE OUTFIT
=
Seolhyun is gonna cry?
=
Wow just wow
=
Ra đc 1 tháng rồi đó mà vẫn replay tới giờ
=
I knew they had talent
=
Everyone: what’s going on?!
Hwasa, knowing that she does extra intro’s as well: they prepared so much for this
=
This is a good and popular song, and OMG performs it in a fantastic way. I don't really know OMG before, but now understand how talent they are.  Good to see them be widely recognized through this platform!
=
Korean ppl please don't sleep on my girls they're talented and deserve more recognize support them
=
Oh my girl are so talented, i hope their company will make them better songs .. remember me was very good 
=
THIS WAS AMAAAAAAAZING
=
The instrument beat made my ♥️ sad even I don't  what they saying they look so cute keeping fighting 
=
Lovelyz version is more cuter, OMG version is more sadder, i like both
=
3:25 envy?
=
Never seen so much korean comments on a video like this. Wow.
=
What is great is they know how build a climax. After being attacked by the vocal powerhouse Hyojung and Seunghee, we immediately got attacked by the visual of Jiho and Arin. And the power dance afterwards. This is what I call performing art!!!
=
THIS COULD PASS AS AN OST FOR A PERIOD DRAMA 
=
WOW! This cover is more view than Lovelyz orginal M/V 
Oh My Girl slay
=
maybe i’m obsessed with this video
=
Why i am crying watching thisssss helpppp
=
I really love this! Can't stop watching and listening~~~
=
Jiho has blone hair is so pretty! 
=
MY QUEENS
=
love from Indonesia
=
They almost beat the views of the original song that is posted in their company yt account STAN TALENT STAN OHMYGIRL
=
Didnt expect this, im not a fan but woah this gives me chills, a lot
=
every members shine brightly in this performance, its just so hard not to fall in love with oh my girl ❤❤❤
=
OH MY GIRL is definitely reaching new heights thanks to this show. Now I'm excited to see their comeback.
=
Each and every song that oh my girl sings sounds so magical 
=
Rip this is actually better then I thought
Edit: how did this get 32 likes wow thank you I wasn’t expecting any likes

Edit: thanks for 48 likes
=
Yep now this is my official ranking 
1.Oh my Girl
it was a shocking performance I would definitely would like to see more 
2.Mamamoo
It shows the skills it was like a concert performance it was just amazing
3.(G)I-dle 
It was very addicting and it was just a wonderful performance 
4.AOA
Their performance was very special and unique but doesn’t get my full attention
Sorry the other two doesn’t even give me interest or even allow me to finish listening to the song well if I really have to do then
5.Park BOM
It was pretty good for a soloist but I kinda expected more
6.Lovelyz 
....... yea it was ok I guess uhhh yea that’s all I have to say I think they tried their hardest and I think they have a lot to improve and I beg you pls don’t scream sing because it just feel weird I’m sorry but no I really disliked it 

This is my opinion this is what my feedback is so pls don’t hate on me you can maybe try to change my point of view of lovelyz or any other group or park bom is you like
=
Finnaly, I found new group to stand
=
Best performance in 2nd round
=
ヒョジョンとスンヒがずば抜けて歌上手いけど、それ以外のメンバーもめちゃくちゃ歌上手い 歌唱力のアベレージがこんな高いグループ無いと思う
Hyojung and Senughee do a magnificent job at singing as i expected, but other members are also pretty good at vocals as well. i think its so rare that all of members are this good at singing.
=
Amazing performance.
=
I don't know much abt them. One of the best YouTube recommendation which I don't regret at all.
Goosebumps. Goosebumps. Goosebumps.
Literally throughout the video!  Wow. Daebak! ♥️
=
MAMA needs this type of performances to add flavor to award shows.
=
Why do i feel like crying even though I didn't understand a thing? They are so powerful.
=
I don't think lots of groups can achieve this level of having both visual aesthetics and instrumental aesthetics that are so pleasing to people's senses
=
I come back to this vid religiously tbh.
=
I can't live any day without coming back to this video
=
Until now, i feel so emotional watching this performance. I can't understand the song but they abled to touch my heart through this. I really love them. My second favorite contestants in Queendom after (G)I-DLE.
=
Congrats for the 1st place, definitely deserved♡
 this performance gives me chills, wow
=
Im gonna stan this group now
=
Lol i'm watch this again
=
I am crying. Beautiful!
=
i need this concept for next comeback 
=
this performance was amazing ohmygod I loved it a lot ;;;;;
=
Let's get 10M
=
BoA's favourite girlgroup. IU's favourite girlgroup. Nayeon & Jihyo's favourite girlgroup. Hani's favourite girlgroup.
Legends stan Oh My Girl.
=
queendom really brought out these girls' potentials
=
It's rare to see hyojung serious expression because our candy leader always smiling
=
I seriously can't stop watching this. I'm not even part of their fandom but this show is drawing me closer to them. They're so talented, the song is a bop, and their voices sounds so good. These girls are pros tbh, I'm actually a moomoo but I say these girls deserve the crown specially that they never lost their color no matter what concept is used. I want to see more of them. Hwaitiiiinngg~
=
Just saying but Binnie looks so elegant
=
CAN WE APRECIATE BINNIE'S PONYTAIL LIKE WTF I LIT RALLY SCREAMED WHEN I SAW IT
=
if Seunghee kills me do NOT prosecute her! she caught ME slipping and that's on ME !
=
Seunghee has SO much stage presence and charisma it’s insane.
=
okay so after watching this i decided to stan OhMyGirls bcs why not? they made the show their own concert!!
=
SEUNGHEE- The most powerful charismatic vampire 
BINNIE- The fabulous queen vampire
HYOJUNG- The sweet but dangerously attractive vampire
ARIN- the mysterious angelic vampire princess
MIMi- The badass chic  vampire that will slay everyone
YOOA - the pirate vampire that is oozing with sex appeal
JIHO - the crazy rich gorgeous vampire
The tree - vampires that loves to dance ❤️
=
OH MY GIRL GETTING THE RECOGNITION THAT THEY DESERVE I AM GOING TO UGLY SOB, I'VE WAITED FOR THIS DAY TO COME
=
I personally liked their last stage better, but I think the members shined more individually here!
=
Now I know why Iz*one's Chaeyeon chose WM Entertainment after she left JYPE. B1A4, ONF, and Oh My Girl are so damn talented yet quite underrated and their songs are immortal bops. These groups are perfect, it's time to stan them all.
=
It just shows that girl groups have so much more potential if you let them do things on their own . Instead of following what their agency tells them .
=
‪OHMYGIRL Proves that MIRACLE is another name for HARDWORK thats why our fandom name is miracle ehe ❤️‬
=
The song is catchy, the concept is epic, the dance is on point, they are gorgeous, and seunghee’s that’s what I’m talking about will be a catchphrase. Honestly, I’m loving OHMYGIRL more after Queendom. Have I said that the song is very good?
=
MIMI'S "EW HOLY MOLY NO WAY WAY WAIT" WILL BE LEGENDARY
=
I'm hoping they will have an oppurtunity to perform closer.
=
one thing i really like about this stage is while they're telling story with their performance here, they also made sure everyone was having fun and i think that's the key point. they're able to make the audience feel connected with them and simply enjoy their stage.
=
Before Queendom:this is a bad idea
After queendom:stan Oh My Girl
=
YooA is literally such an underrated dancer I don’t get why she isn’t as hyped as Momo or Lisa but y’all aren’t ready for that conversation yet.
=
Binnie’s long hair is so gorgeous
=
*mimi's HOLY MOLY was needed*
=
Oh My Girl show us than all this time they was criminaly underrated
=
Mamamoo had the best "concert" stages and Oh My Girl had the best "story" stages. Both were fantastic.
=
My Daily OH MY GIRL Playlist:
1. Guerilla
2. Twilight (Queendom, Concert', Japan version)
3. MJ - Smooth Criminal (YooA Queendom)
4. LH - Scarerow (Hyojung YouTube Channel)
5. Lvlz - Destiny (OH MY GIRL Performance)

10. OH MY GIRL - The Fifth Season
11. OH MY GIRL - Vogue
12. OH MY GIRL - Checkmate
etc.
=
Ariana Grande who? I only know Binnie 
=
This is not even a title song from their album
=
Park Bom didn't even know who they were at the start of the competition. But then OMG rocked stage, after stage, after stage.. and even though they could've been prideful (honestly the way that Park Bom was at the start), they could've gloated about the fact that they were ALWAYS ranking above her, and clearly one of the favorites, instead.. they befriended her, and basically treated her as one of their group, always making sure she was included in group settings. This is one of the MANY reasons I'm a hardcore Miracle!
=
honestly came here again for mimi’s rap part
=
when seunghee came on cam and all the girls started commenting about her beauty... MY BIGGEST MOOD
=
The camera didn't give any justice to this performance. Need to watch full cam to even more amazed.
=
Winner of queendom should perform at MAMA. And the winner is Oh My Girl
=
SEUNGHEE'S FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE SO ON POINT EVERY SINGLE TIME!  just WOW
=
I'm so mad that I've been sleeping on them for so long
=
no ones talking about Binnie (my bias) and how heavenly she looked
that ponytail really opened up her gorgeous face
=
from oh my fairies to oh my warriors and now oh my vampires? they're really master of concept
=
did anyone else catch that they started Twilight the way they ended Destiny? genius
=
When they announced that Oh My Girl will join Queendom. I had mixed feelings. I'm happy, proud and kind of scared. Because they might gain both love and hate. So I prepared myself for it. But now, I really can't stop to feel hurt and be disappointed because of the criticisms that people called 'their opinion' not just to Oh My Girl, but to other group as well. Was it really hard to just enjoy all of the groups performances and don't mind the rankings? They all give their best here. Let us all enjoy watching the performances and the groups lovely interactions.
=
I'm a fan now. They amazingly talented
=
Seunghee - class high vampire
Yooa - barbie vampire
Binnie - cartoon vampire
Jiho - vintage(old movie) vampire
Arin - innocent vampire
Hyojong - mature vampire
Mimi - British vampire
=
OMG's performances always like a musical, in every concept they never loose their original roots. And i just love how AOA always support them like big sisters, meanwhile mamamoo like a supportive friends
=
I've been sleeping on them  officialy a fan now
=
I love how Mimi's rap part is always highlighted
=
Been a fan since Cupid! I’m so proud of Oh My Girl!!! Didn’t Stan the wrong group
=
I became a Miracle through Queendom and I'm just so happy to have met them here! Oh My Girl is a gem, and now I believe they won't be hidden anymore!
=
I want a whole dance practise so i can dance the dance break
=
I'm so happy that I discovered these girls on Fifth Season, I digged almost all of their title songs, and some of their sidetracks. Almost of them ar3 good and suit my taste. Added with their personality, their history, their hardworks, their capabilities, their lately achievements, even if those are somewhat miniscule compared to other groups, but for me all of them are precious, cause somehow what they did all these years are finally starting to pay off. Now I can say they're my all-time favorite of all GGs I have been stumbled upon.
=
I’m obsessed with this song and the dance and just this whole performance and vocals ❤️
=
I was worried that they took part in queendom vs bigger groups since it’s about digital sales & viewing after all but somehow i think WM made the right decision. It’s their era now and allow others to know them well and see their talents and concept queens beside their company‘s package image. This is really about their teamwork and talents which make them unique. They respected each other and work as a team and finally get more recognition from Koreans and international fans. I’m happy for them and hope they can win queendom even though there must be alot who likes and dislike. When there’s popularity, it will definitely attract both likes and dislikes. This sounds better than nobody knows who’s oh my girl :)
=
This whole competition is Oh My Girl's time! They always present amazing performance!!!
=
I'm a Park Bom stan for life but Oh My Girl are stealing my heart! These past two stages have been my favorites of Queendom
=
"Even if I was to be born again, I want to become an oh my girl member again with the same members"
- Yooa, 2k19, JoyNews' 15th Anniversary Interview
=
Oh My Girl totally deserved to win this round.
=
Binnie’s high ponytail
Mimi’s strong rap
No one?????????????????
=
FULLCAM & FANCAM version of this I suggest everyone go watch it then you'll understand how Great and deserved no1 their performance was and why the Live Audience love it so much......
=
I love how every of the members has it's own charisma and stage presence. OMG is truly exceptional!
=
OH MY GIRL QUEENSSSSSSS
=
Every stage they put out was so epic and tastefully done
=
I'm sorry Oh My Girl, I just recognize you after joining Queendom.
=
shouldnt Arin be one of the Visual Goddesses of KPOP..CMONNN LOOK AT HER
=
Binnie looks so incredibly unreal that i barely recognized her, it’s probably the ponytail though
=
I love that they always have a story behind their songs and performances! I’m officially stanning them! 
=
I can't believe how they improve so much.. from bottom to the top!
=
Binnnie has been one of my kpop bias since she had that red hair during remember me era and seeing her in queedom just make me love her more.
Also we already got dance collaboration and unit vocals but not rap collab? Look at how fire mimi rap here. We need rap collab of jimin, moonbyul, mimi amd soyeon.
=
Really yooa and seunghee really bring energy to the stage
=
Binnie totally feelin that vampire concept too deep, she pop out of nowhere from the last two eps to that stage and then disappear again never be seen.
A real vampire indeed
=
IT'S TIME TO BECOME WM PRIDE NON FANS!!!  B1A4, OH MY GIRL, ONF, CHAEYEON IZONE
=
Why do I feel Hotel Transylvania in this performance? Monsters party let's go 
=
THIS WAS JUST VAMPIRES CONCERT 
=
I fall in love with OH MY GIRL, they are amazing
!!!!
The song is very exciting and her voice is beautiful.
Seunghee this lovely I love it
=
Wowwww I give them AAA-2019
A creative consept, a good song, the biggest stage of Queendom. Oh my girl deserve to be the winner. I wish they will be the true winner in final. Good luck
=
After watching this for five times I just realized Mimi untie her hair when she prepare for her raping part  she looks nice both in tied hair and untied
=
Binnies high ponytail consists of all of your wigs
Hyojung and Seunghees Adlibs are to die for
=
No one is doing fairy like OMG is doing it
=
Their stage presence is no joke. Congrats girls.
=
They gave it all for their performance. Their hair were messy at the end of performing.
=
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS PERFORMANCE. I'M SO GLAD OH MY GIRL IS SHINING BRIGHT IN QUEENDOM!!
=
Seunghee always looks gorgeous
=
You know... this is another oh my girl's live performance with 1M+ viewers. I feel so happy to see how much they grow. I never see oh my girl live performance reach this much viewers before. They are one of rising idol this year. I'm so happy about this.
=
YES YES YES to Binnie's ponytail hair extension...really suits her face and figure...such a pretty baby
=
*THOSE SALTY DISLIKES LOOOOL OKAY OH MY GIRL STILL #1*
=
i had to rewatch this performance bcos its really good and to capture everything i missed out
=
Mimi's part always kills me
=
My god the looks, the theme, the DANCE BREAK! I can’t stop watching ❤️❤️
=
Never knew OMG has this hidden gem song..
=
I'm so happy that Remember Me's rival song Twilight finally gets to be popular as well 
=
I’m so glad they came on the show cuz I have really LOVED their performances here. I used to just kind of lump them together with all the “cutesy” groups, I had no idea they had these VOCALS and amazing performance ability. Ive learned all their names just through this show cuz they all stand out and contribute something unique to their performance. They really have a gift for carrying STRONG FEMININE ENERGY through their performance and that makes them so unique. New fan here ☺️
=
THEY SHOULD DO MV FOR THIS SONG HM
=
I always knew that they would  get the attention they deserved someday, it finally happened.  I cannot even express how grateful and proud I am. I love You Ohmygirl and I will always do. ♥️
=
YooA's hair is a struggle
=
If Seunghee played Edward Cullen I would've been fine with watching the movie Twilight
4:40 look at that stare damn
=
THIS IS WHERE THE BLONDE SISTERS/ HOLY BLONDE TRINITY WAS FORMED!! 4:11-4:30 ❤️
=
I was so happy they chose this, said many times this song should have been title track!!!
=
QUEENDOM MADE ME A YOOA STAN

4:47 Yooa striking my heart
=
Yooa's voice really suited this song, they did so well till now
=
I lost count of how many times I watched this performance. It's just so damn amazing. All the luck in the world for OMG and their fandom!
=
WoW, Seriously amazing performance! Love the vibes of this song so much!!!!
=
OMG always has this epic feel to their songs <3
=
Mimi’s smile at the end of her rap keeps me awake at night. LIKE AHHHHH!!! She’s too pretty ✨
=
This whole performance gave me uncountable goosebumps i cant even!!!!
=
I cant stop shed my tears , this is a beautiful masterpiece  goodjob girls, keep it up!
=
oh my girl all I can say oh my gosh this performance was so gorgeous and great speechless and jaw dropping and also there visuals are so stunning!!!
=
i love omg.....this is one of my favorite songs of theirs... so glad they picked this song.. this is a great performance.   you can't help but to love them.... jack usa
=
Oh My Girl really captures me with every performance especially Destiny and this one. I kinda fell for them xD
=
General Hyejeong's gay glasses for Seunghee 
=
Love it All their perfomances! Hope they will win Queendom, their song sound good.
=
That's my girls. So proud of them proving how amazing they are. Binnie slaying with that long pony tail.
=
WOW!!!!
OMG slayed the stage again!
I love twilight original choreo, and i love this one too! 
Great job Oh My Girl ❤
=
I hope more international kpop fans can recognize them. oh my girl is one of the hidden gem in kpop
=
This is iconic and I’m proud to come back and watch it!!!
=
i’m not even a stan but this girls are amazing
=
I‘m so proud of my girls  they deserve to win. I will always be a Miracle ♥️♥️♥️FOREVER.
=
Miracle already happen to Oh my girl.
=
Out of all groups, I think Oh My Girl is the most stable.. like, every performances are great. especially this
#sorry for my English
=
Damn this is so addicting..
=
they always bring tears to my eyes when they perform. so proud of them!  look at how much they've grown and blossomed
=
I was hoping for Closer, one of the most beautiful songs ever made
=
This felt a lot like western pop and I really liked it!
=
I wish i could get the world to see their talented asses they are so underrated!!!
=
the true winners of queendom
=
Why does this video have only 2.5 million views? It was THE best song of the entire show, perhaps even the entire decade; I have been playing it on repeat for a week straight now, and I simply can't stop, not even to sleep. Did Korea just somehow suddenly stop appreciating music or something?
=
Well that's it. Officially stanning oh my girl now. Thanks mnet ✨✨✨
BTW the pony tail suits Bini so much she looks gorgeous
=
I really like their makeup! 
I'm amazed  
I hope I can see another concept like this too!  OMG always bring fresh performance and beautiful song ❤
=
I'm so proud of my girls, so proud to be a Miracle 
=
Haters gonna hate but OMG is here to stay!! 
=
Twilight, Love O'Clock, One Step Two Steps, B612 and In My Dreams are my ultimate OMG B-sides because of how wonderful they put certain stories on its lyrics. OMG created their own fairy tale universe through a wide repertoire of their discography, rather than the filmography of their MVs.
You can have a Kpop MV with horror or creepy themes, but to put such theme into a song is hella rare. OMG is indeed a superior girl group with a treasure of wonderful songs.
The discovery of Twilight is befitted with the Pandora Box theme of this episode. OMG was simply pick one of their B-sides and able to show their top class performance on it.
They, I said, are on the path of becoming a legendary K-pop group.
=
1:05 , the iconic seughee phrase used for AOA’s version of egotistic... LOVE IT
=
There was a pole at the beginning of the show that questioned who would get first, second etc...   In last place was Oh My Girl with as a 22.5 to 1 longshot.  Look at them now!!!
=
I still couldn’t believe that Yooa is just 5’2
=
Seunghee looks so gorgeous
=
Jiho Binnie are  getting even more beautiful every day. 
=
Every time i rewatch it i feel like this is the fist time 
Love you oh my girl really happy that people start love you 
Let's show them who oh my girl are fighting 
=
I'm so glad they picked this it's one of my favorite b side songs by any group ever ❤
=
They are just keeping to surprise me with each performance I can’t expect them .. they are my supertalented girls  fighting OMG
=
WMEnt. we need a dance practice here...well thank you♥♥♥♥
I love this so much, OMG is the best~ ^^♥
=
4:06 this part ❤️
=
THEY JUST WENT URI TEAM ANIYA THIS IS A COMPETITION
=
Wow now i understand why they won!
=
Damn, queendom. Through this show, Oh My Girl became one of my underrated group that I should stan. If they had lots of songs or concepts like this (talking to their normal comebacks or songs, more girly and that's not my style) maybe I noticed them early than this show, queendom. Go yooa, seunghee, and mimi 
=
This has been my favorite song from them since its realease and to finally watch it come alive in national tv is just so satisfying! I'm so happy and proud! They deserve all the fame and recognition for their hard work and talent.
=
Yooa is my bias now she's so stunning and attractive❤. All members are amazing too. I'm starting to stan OMG❤❤❤.Time for shine girls :*
=
So today they will perform 'Guerilla' in queendom, I'm so excited !!
=
THATS RIGHT KOREA! OH MY GIRL IS COMING FOR YOUR WIGS, EYEBROWS, SLIPPERS, EVERYTHING. THEY DOMINATED THIS STAGE
=
oh my girl. im so proud of u. cant lie this is the fact 
=
4:47 watch again and again this part omg Yooa~
=
It took me a while to realize this is oh my girl cause they litteraly SNAPPED 
I still want them to perform closer though cause I found them only during lair lair era and missed a heavenly era
=
This stage was absolutely awesome! Truly magical
=
Seunghee getting the reaction she deserves <3
=
I LOVE THIS SOOOOOOOOONG OMGGGGGGGG <3
=
Seunghee is on fire
=

=
Mihyun OWNED this
=
I love the heart formation at 4:57 with the 5 male dancers acting like shadows there

Oh My Girl and Free Mind really did not come to play around
=
they're so good. it looks like they having fun dancing to this song
=
they definitely deserved first place!! 
=
超愛這場師妹啊真棒
WM的孩子們就是這麼優秀
OMG
=
i'm sobbing at yooa's wig
=
me after watching this : twilight twilight twilight na na na na spotlight spotlight spotlight yehh oh eh oh eh ~
=
Holy heck. This concept. These costumes. This performance.
=
.. and THATS a performance. period!!!!!
=
I really hope oh my girl wins this show
=
OH MY GIRL NEVER DISAPPOINTS US
=
Seunghee is totally different Oh My WOW
=
They are the best, no doubt
=
Yooa is so pretty with blonde hair 
=
BINNIE TOOK MY HEART OUT! GOSHHH
=
feel like yooa's outfit spoil some clues about their final stage :D
=
Essa musica gruda na cabeça de uma forma incrível  Eu vendo tv: oe oeeeeooo. Eu lavando louça: oe oeeeeooo. Eu varrendo a casa: oe oeeeeooo.  Kkkkk amo vocês meninas ♥️♥️
=
4:33 I felt gay for second
=
Wow! Queen of concepts! The Halloween styling is too pretty
=
I just want anyone to know that streaming using apple music/spotify does NOT count towards their digital score!
You need to stream using korean music apps (melon, genie, bugs, etc.,) in order for your streams to count! Last day to stream is on the 28th!
=
Blonde Yooa is what I live for
=
Wooo for me are the ones that deserve to be winners, evolved with each presentation and took care of every detail, presence, good dance, voice and excellent costumes but above all a lot of effort. Num 1
=
Gosh, i a here for the girls reactions. Are priceless
=
AOA fangirling on OMG and OMG fangirling on AOA, this is true love
=
I'm watching all performances again now that Queendom is over... I'm so proud of them 
=
The last minute is E-VE-RY-THING!!! OMG!!
=
I hơpe Oh My Girl will performance in Mama 2019
=
Seunghee is on fire
=
YooA looks like an elf ❤❤
=
So, I've watched this performance for like the millionth time and this time, I put myself in a state where I didn't know about them before Queendom and this is my first performance by them that I've seen. Guys it really works. I felt so overwhelmed watching as if I didn't know them till just now. I had to pause and replay some parts cuz I couldn't handle how incredible they are.
=
I love this live version a lot more than the studio version because of how powerful their vocals are in the chorus
=
But Yooa fighting her wig half way through though.  Get it main dancer!
=
i keep falling for them more and more im glad i found them ☺️
=
truely, the name oh my girl fit
them perfectly, their performance allway make people suprise
=
Oh My Girl it's the next Queendom
=
I am living for this long haired Bini!
=
OH MY GIRL,  BAE BINNIE!!!!
=
Jiho looks like a vampire princess. If Korea remade twilight she'd be perfect for it  they definitely killed this round ❤️
=
they are so pretty omg!!!! especially seunghee 
=
Omg I love mimi and hello holy moly lol 
=
That Jimin editing fail tho...
=
Oh My Girl and G-idle stages are the best ❤️
=

=
It sticks in my mind
=
MIMI'S RAP O_O SLAY GIRL

Queendom ha mostrado una evolución de Oh My Girl increíble
Se ven tan confiadas ....
Twilight es una canción de mis fav del mini álbum "Remember me" y desde que ví una presentación en Japón (si no estoy mal) de esa canción quedé flechada pero déjame decirte que está presentación rompió todas mis expectativas 
Hyo Jung y Seung Hee se ven muy maduras y sexys 
Wow 
Definitivamente They are on the point
=
*They're getting more fans now* , including me. So proud of them, first I noticed YooA from KBS show then Seunghee from many varieth shows, and now starting to falling in love with them as a group! OH MY GIRL FIGHTING!!
=

=
Não consigo superar essa performance, OMG dominando tudo ♥ Hyejeong surtando por elas é tudo pra mim <3
=
Honestly, as a Miracle, for this round I did not expect OMG to be 1st place, but I'm still very thankful for it. I mean as in I'm not gonna complain if other groups got 1st, my original prediction for the 1st place was going to be Mamamoo actually...
=
what an amazing performance from oh my girl, the girls have improve so munch since their first performance in this contest. looking forward their next performance
=
They deserve to be well known as BTS has do. They are not idol grup, They are artist!
=
U all agreed that its seunghee's era ⚡⚡⚡
=
ok but they look GORGEOUS
=
Boring? Just play this song and you will dance like crazy people in your own world
=
Yooa is soooooo pretty with white hair, it makes her truly looks like a queen Her point at last goes straight to my heart, just like a bullet ❤❤❤ Shoot me plz❤❤❤ Thank u do much Queendom, otherwise we won't be able to see this side of cool cool Oh My Girl
=
Terpesona dengan kibasan rambutnya para member, trutama si arin yang di menit 3:19 dan  yooa beserta wig nya..
Highnotenya seunghee jadi bikin mau nangis,
=
for the 1.1k dislikes... guys, all alright in house?
=
World class entertainers right here folks
=
Can we applaud for the dancer team too? The way they stay in that tree formation from the start on the side to support every detail moves for the girls, then smoothly moving to the center in the middle of the song to give Mimi best killing scenes. Even Moonbyul realized how detailed the choreography is. 
Oh My Girl and the team has really worked hard! They still keep their own color even with different concepts. I'm so proud of them and happy finally they got more attention as they deserve 
=
They WORK HAAAARDD
=
Seunghee  
=
i need mv this song !!!!!! love love i really OMG ver. queendom
=
mi tema favorito de oh my girl....!!!
=
Concept fairies.
=
I feel attacked by Arin at 3:16
=
wait how can binnie's arm turn 360 degrees????? that looks so cool 1:34
=
MY GIRLS SLAAAAAAAY
=
Cool 
=
This performance was worth watching live
=
I think the music will be changed a bit into horor music.
But i admire it, it still refresh me with horor concept
=
Binnieeee 
=
Can the camera crew stop moving around im trying to find find out who's adding flavor or doing add lip cos dayum
=
focus on hyejeong..aaah kwiyowo
=
Binnie in long ponytail alone slayed so hard
=
is this a halloween party?
=
I got a message from Duolingo watching this: “It’s time for you daily German lesson” I think not!!
=
Thank you queendom for making these underrated queens shine even more.
=
terrorificamente lindo como todas las presentaciones de OH MY GIRLS  en est show perfecto hasta el minimo detalle
=
i hopw their managementbcan learn from this: that OMG can do many genres
=
0:51
=
lloro de emocion de ver que estan recibiendo mas reconocimiento se lo merecen hace mucho
=
Wow I'm mind blown again
=
I feel blackpink style, but OMG goodness
=
Has anyone noticed that Mimi (I think, she was the woman who rapped) was in a ponytail at the first part? Then her hair was down when the rap started? 
AAAAAAAAAAAA--
=
EH KEREN BANGET DAH WOI
=
Amazing....
=
Yooa 
=
Moonbyul + Soyeon = Mimi
=
WINNERS
=
Que coisa mais lindaaaaaaaaa 
=
I love mimi's rap
=
Where's my wig ? It's lost
=
WHY NO ONE’S TALKING ABOUT HOW JIHO STILL SLAYS THE CHOREOGRAPHY WEARING THAT HEAVY AND LONG DRESS???
=
4:43
=
Hey. Guys.  GO! Full cam ver.
=
Lo digo una vez más, orgulloso de pertenecer a este Fandom ❤
=
Binnie 's hairs have grown so long but she'd better release her hairs to be more beautiful.   Yooa 's yellow hairs look like a demon.  Arin is very beautiful because she had correct hairstyle
=
最初ミムジョセンターにしたの天才すぎじゃない？
=
BINNIE NEVER LOOK BETTER , and YOOA BLONDE YES PLEASE!!!
=
*Queens snapped*
=
a hide-and-seek game between a girl and a vampire.
=
表白噜妹，表白祉呼，真是概念妖精，太喜欢惹
=
The backup dancer at 1:20 the first one on the right of the girl is Lee Sejin from Producex101????
=
Always putting on amazing performances! I’m loving the storytelling and creativity for this stage. Jiho’s creative director skills have been so useful for Queendom. I love the leadership and support in OMG. The Freemind dancers and team did a great job too. As expected of Oh My Girl, you’re getting quality content.
=
Mimi!!!!!!
=
I love them so so muchhhh
=
ผีฟ้าเอย เรามาเต้นรำ~~~~
=
Hi Miracle, don't forget support Boygroup ONF & WM Dream Tree Girl (Lee Chae Yeon, Hwang Chaewon, Young In, Seung Hyun, Hyunseo, Joowon). They are OH MY GIRL Junior. Listen all their song & give your love to them.
=
❤
=
^3^
=
YooA is really ramping the energy
Like everytime she sings the chorus
All the members become more energetic 
And this song is gold
And yooa looks pretty in blond :D
=
I've been a fan since their showed their version of Destiny, I got immersed more deeply and now I'm a fan. This song SLAPS really hard to those who are saying they can't do dark concepts! ✨
BUT LET'S CELEBRATE BECAUSE THEY WON AGAIN FOR THIS ROUND OMG!!! ✨✨✨
=
Oh, my girl, we're competing for guerrilla music. Please stream.
=
I get goosebumps evertime I watch this, I'm just so proud of Oh My Girl
=
I just get chills whenever I watch one of their queendom performances, like from the very beginning of this show we know they ain't playing around and ypu can see that inthis performance too. I can't wait to see waht they will bring in the final round.
=
Woww it's a masterpiece. Oh my girl deserve win again. Their  concept are very creative.. I appreciate for their Good Performance.
=
They really went crazily beautiful because of Queendom  Gosh the dancebreak  they gave their all 
=
I think 
Fav part 4.34 (why hyojung look so gorgeous, really different) 
Best part 4.45-4.53 (the audience make performance more lively)
=
BLONDE YOOA OMG YASSS
=
im so glad omg perform this my fav b side track from them aahhhhhh so good. at first i am wondering how this will be different bcus the first part is just like the original song. but wahhh i am glad they keep the original arrangement of the song. wahhh so good
=
Wow! I don't know a whole lot about Oh My Girl. I'm so glad they did Queendom, so they can show off all their amazing talents with killer concepts! Loved this performance. ❤
And other note. I couldn't stop laughing at Hyejeong's hand glasses. I swear she's shown the most for every performance reaction. She's literally a walking meme! 
=
Man, Binnie looks so good, although they all did superbly.
=
Yooa’s killing part @3:22 is insanely amazing
=
Wow I love it!!! Go oh my girl!!!!!
=
WHEN THE DANCE BREAK CAME IN OMG THEY REALLY FELT LIKE THE NUMBER ONE GIRL GROUP TAKING OVER THE WORLD FOR REAL I'm so in love
=
the song is so greattttt
=
WOW WOW OH MY GIRL WOW WOW
=
YEAH MIMI HOLY MOLY!!!
=

みみやば
=
I love how Seunghee’s “This is it!” Has become iconic! 
=
When asked if the group’s unique girly image sometimes approaches its limit, they replied, “The girly and fairy-tale-like atmosphere is Oh My Girl’s strength. It’s also the style that we can express best. We’re not going to give up our identity to show something new. The important thing is that we have more than one style. We think there’s a very wide spectrum that we can express as girls. While participating in ‘Queendom’ this time, we were convinced that when we focused on our own styles and added something else, we could show a lot more variety.” — Oh My Girl, Cosmopolitan Korea Interview.
=
Oh wow, this song is so refreshing
=
Seriously though let's talk about YooA. She is such a precious gem and is so talented it's a wonder why she's so underrated. She's a visual (obviously), she dances so well (and in my opinion, one of the best in the kpop industry), has a great facial expression and she is actually stable in singing. She's the one who drew me in the group and now I love them all so much and they are such a talented group and they really deserve everything! 
I've been with them since the Closer era and I've never heard them singing a bad song. Their performances are so well thought and I love their not-so-usual concepts and even their costumes. I hope that after this show, Oh My Girl will get the attention that they really deserve. I really want to see more of them in more shows in the near future. Much love to these girls. ❤❤❤
=
I would love to hear them sing their song closer on queendom. I fell in love with omg, bc I discovered that since it that was so mesmerizing
=
They secured the win with this intro in my opinion. So proud of how far they’ve come in terms of recognition. I’m glad they got to showcase an ounce of why we love them so much. ARIN! Ugh you’re turning into a woman. ❤️
=
So proud to be miracle since their debut 
=
Every concept never failed on Oh My Girl. It strangely suitable to every member. Every member captures with their own uniqueness. Yooa's awesome dance, Seunghee's fierce aura, Hyojung's amazing vocal, Mimi's badass rapp, Binnie's strong charisma, also to our duo undeniable visuals: Jiho and Arin. 
It's so amusing to see their performance.
=
This performance is awesome, outfit, song, oh my Girl is so talented and very beautifull 
=
Hands down best in group in queendom
=
No wonder why oh my girl was the 1st 
If last stage destiny they made for a Legend stage, and this time they're making a concert ，look how the audience enjoy their show 
((Sry for my broken eng. ))
=
Is always the same fandom complaining...tell your faves to bring something new for once and then cry
=
theyre really the prettiest girl group ever though im feeling things
=
Binnie just slayed with her long hair
=
I was so looking fwd to their performance every week in QUEENDOM and they do deliver the best. OMG is now my bias for loop. Seunghee is so beautiful
=
seunghee slayed so hard I might be gay
=
Okay I've avoided stanning them for a while because I don't have time to stan a third group but this stage is too powerful. I was clearly wrong for too lon. I've never seen such elegance, power, and pure entertainment united as in here.
=
I am so proud of them!!!! Idk why but I’m like legit you proud of them for slaying this!! I felt this in my soul ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
You cant deny that they went HARD especially seunghee Oml oh my Girl
=
I'm going to stan OMG.. they got me during Destiny performance..then i just watched YooA performing Smooth Criminal, i got goosebumps and i covered my mouth cus i was so shocked by her performance.. PS i got my eyes on Seunghee since the beginning of this show because of her reactions..lmao..someone need to point out who is who..i only know Seunghee and YooA
=
Today I'm a proud Miracle 
I remember all my friends saying, "You like Oh My Girl? But they're nothing more than summer girl cute" But once I showed them Closer or Secret Garden, they usually go WHOA! 
And now Queendom really did them justice. Rise Oh My Girl! You deserve the world! If only my bias wrecker JinE is still around.
=
From now on, I'll stan Oh My Girl. 
=
Wow! Epic! I loved everything about this performance! The music is so good, the choreography is perfect, the girls are excellent singers and dancers. The concept was amazing especially!
=
Things Seunghee did. 
*THAT*
=
I'm so proud of em, so energetic and yet still looking beautiful even with their hair flying everywhere 
=
*Stan OMG, Stan TALENT*
=
MY GIRLS 
=
AOA’s comments are so adorable  but my god this was absolutely amazing
=
Happy 1M Oh My Girl. 
So proud of you girls!!
=

If oh my girl performs on Mama again..  I hope mnet   not dare to cut/make short their performance.
=
this song is from one of their albums?
=
AOA sure adore Seunghee a lot lol.
=
ohmygirl can be the nation girl group but nobody is ready for that conversation and it shows.
=
yooa, mimi & jiho trio during the dance break is no joke! 
=
Is it me the only one that got super captivated by Seunghee's facial expressions and voice
=
WowamazingOh my girl
=
I want to see oh my Girls everyday..  I like all song oh my Girls. Because song oh my Girls so diferent
=
The beginning of this performance is the same as the the ending of Destiny’s.
Does it mean that they died and woke up as a vampire? ‍♀️ 
Mind blowing  
Performance asides, their vocals are solid, stable and amazing.
=
What's there fandom name?
=
1:02
=
Now these ladies can definitely pull off a stronger concept that’s in contrast to their original concept without making it look cringeworthy. Seems like they’ve got a lot of potential to grow into a more mature concept and keep going over the next few years. I’ve to say, Seunghee is deadly charismatic.
=

=
YooA is so good. She is totally different.
=
yooA looks like a living doll with that blonde hair she looks so unreal
=
Can we also appreciate the amazing job done by their dancers, stylists, make-up artistes, lighting and graphics teams and all the staff who made this masterpiece of a performance possible? Without all of their dedication to their craft this wouldn't have been possible. I am literally so thankful. ❤️
=
OMG brought their Immortal Song game to an audience that matches their demographic. Well played.
=
Came here after watching the 9th episode..
Who cried when Seunghee cried? Me T.T
Never felt so emotional before, but seeing OMG won again made me really happy :') Tbh, I'm a newbie Miracle, knew OMG just before watching Queendom.. And I'm grateful to know them before I watched Queendom :') Flashback to the 1st episode, when they were not even recognized by Park Bom, and got chosen by 3 groups to be under their performances, but then slowly got chance to show their real talents by performing Destiny (this is masterpiece!) and got the 1st rank! :') Thank God they maintained the rank in the 3rd elimination, thanks to YooA's 1st rank in performance unit and Hyojung's 2nd rank in vocal unit :') Oh yeah, never forget we have smart Jiho with her brilliant ideas :D Finally, people are awake from sleeping on OMG! :)))
=
OH MY GIRL LITERALLY MADE THE WHOLE performance EXPERIENCE REFRESHINGG
=
Wow OH MY GIRL is really perfect there so beautiful and talented
=
THEY WENT SO HARD
=
I can't stop replaying 1:01
Sunghee looks so gorgeous
=
1:02 Sunghee is so beautiful
=
'MIRACLE' i just wanna say that i love you all.
=
This is what I've been waiting for....!!!!
I can't believe they excel my expectations so hard when I already have high expectations 
They're so gorgeous and beautiful and luxurious and majestic 
We all know that Oh my girl consists of beautifully ladies but with that dresses with that hairstyle, they look even more dazzling
All of them have their own charms and not overshadowing each other 
I swear Arin is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen 
and Jiho with that hairstyle, gives me so much feel 
I can't believe hyojung did that... my lovely smiley sweetie girl did that... she can hit my face and I'm the one who say sorry
I'm a girl but damn I love them 
I hope WM will give them better mv and better costume for their next comeback
=
I’m keeping replay the rap part
=
Binnie’s voice is so good 
=
Seunghee has endless sides 
=
1:02 OH MY GIRL FUN THANK ME LATER!
=
Queens ❤️
=
真是棒！！美翻了帥呆啦...Oh My Girl
=
HELLO OHMYGIRL SINGING THEIR SWEET SONG BUT MAKING IT LOOK DAMN FREAKING BEAUTIFUL AND VAMPIRERY LOWKEY
=
I’m so happy they chose Twilight
=
Wow Senghee! 
She sure fits this style!
=
Omg Arin❤️❤️
=
WOW SEUNGHEE!
=
Seunghee yaaa saranghae ❤️❤️❤️
=
HERE I GO AGAIN. SEUNGHEE JUST STEP ON ME PLEASE BABY
=
Oh My Girls Is so cute and sexy 
=
Hyejeong PLEASE. 
=
Yooa you go girl 
=
Mimi’s part is seriously the best part in the whole performance
=
YOU KNOW THIS SONG SLAPS SO HARD WHEN YOOA'S WIG ALMOST GOT SNATCH EVERYTIME
=
*OH MY GIRL IS A SERVE. PERIOD.*
=
THE HAIRSTYLIST BETTER KEEP THEIR HAIR LIKE THIS FOR THE NEXT COMEBACK!!! GOSH IM SO IN LOVE WITH BINNIE
=
If after this show people don't realize that Mimi is one of the best female idol rappers out there, I'll start throwing hands.
=
WHY DOES OH MY GIRL HAVE LITERALLY THE BEST STAGES AND EVERYONE STILL LOOKS DOWN ON THEM
=
watched this two days ago because i liked their destiny stage since then i watched this vid more than 50 times and now I stan OMG. Now i see WM trains and creates talented girl groups, i don't feel as anxious for my ult bias chaeyeon (IZONE). also i found my ult visual bias in Arin she's beautiful!
=
AOA's comments crack me up
=
振り付けのディテールが面白い。何度も見てしまう。
時計の針が１時を指すところ、ミミのラップの最後にジホにつながる笑顔、股の間から手が出てくる、など、振り付け師がいい仕事をしている。
=
Twilight is their best song. It could've been a hit.
=
We dont need MAMA for OH MY GIRL, We need more grant awards than MAMA. MAMA just only for same idol that every year got trophy
=
I am a fan of Yooa but seeing Seunghee working hard for this performance made me fell hard for her. Oh my girl deserve winning first place! No one can change my mind.
=
MY FAVOURITE SONG FROM THEMDJDJD I'M DYING! SO PROUD 
=
To everyone here, go and watch the live concert performance of this song with earphones on. Thank me later. 
=
1:33  it's one of my fav choreo in this performance  and also reminds me of TXT- Run away choreo. Great minds think alike! ✨
=
I was really looking forward to see them perform in MAMA this year..  You know to see them perform SSFWL on the stage magically and mesmerize every other artists present there. I really want them to be recognised internationally
=
i love how jimin and soyeon reacted to mimi's rap at 3:03. yasssss gurl! show them ure more than "just an idol rapper" <3 #lovemimi
=
To everyone. I would like to recommend you all to watch the full cam version. ❤❤❤
=
Seunghee looks so beautiful and I love AOA being so supportive 
=
That dance break was AMAZING  so proud of you all!!
=
Please watch omg's 4K full cam. Then, you will feel the difference between this and full cam.
=
0:02 this choreo was their ending choreo in  destiny performance, GIRL I-
=
I am a lovelinus but OMG just keeps on surprising me every time!! Time to stan them!!!
=
3:07 i will never forget that smile
=
oh my girl are all talented they always give an amazing performances
=
Jiho so pretty 
=
Ok damn this is the best out of all I have to admit
=
Oh! Hi! 
I'm back here again.
=
Seunghee, this is what i talking about.... 
=
They're like vampires pretending to be human  PERFECTION ❣️
=
Binnie look hella epic with that ponytail
=
please view fullcam PD didn't capture real qeen's performance
=
WELL DESERVED WINN
=
How great if their every comeback songs are in this styles
=
Chaeyeon must be proud to her unnies.
=
Idk what to comment but they slay this performance
=
I felt that twilight song, shows off their versatility . Luckily they pick this song
=
WE ARE NOW ENTERING OH MY GIRL'S ERA EVERYONE
=
I NEED OH MY GIRL PERFORMANCE  IN MAMA 2019!!!
=
God..  Biniie
.omg.  to be honest all of them.  Omg.
=
MAMA just happened earlier that expected is it just me or this looks like a perf that could be seen in this year's MAMA?
=
They actually look like dolls 
=
WOW!
=
I SAY QUEENS YOU SAY OH MY GIRL
=
The blonde trio needed to be a dark-unit yesterday. When they were up front at the end in the dance break it was too powerful. They'd be a pretty ferocious dance/vocal/visual unit on stage.
=
Oh my god jiho
=
Seunghee 
=
I’m sorry it took so long but I’m official a fan of Oh My Girl now!!! I enjoyed their Destiny stage and was sold with Twilight! ☺️
=
Seunghee's stage presence is unmatched. Wow. I'm in shock over how good Oh My Girl is. You just gained yourself a new diehard fan!!
=
As a miracle since oh my girl debuted, I feel proud of oh my girl presence. They continue to grow and surprise many people. With purely talent and the REAL teamwork. It's a pity there are still many people who said that oh my girl doesn't deserve first place. I mean, your favs won't always be number one. They have their own achievements, please respect what happened. If you know, this is actually just a tactic of MNET to boost their own program ratings by creating fanwar. I mean, even everyone is friends at Queendom, why do fans have to type harsh words and hate other people's favs. When your favs doesn't get first place, at least there is still plenty of time to make beautiful things happen. No need to rush, just enjoy the road. The most important thing is how we can show our love to our favs. Please be calm and be more elegant. Don't fall in MNET's trap babe
=
I'm so happy I've discovered them through Queendom❣️❣️❣️ they are so good
=
OMG!! I think it's amazing, I love it 
=
Oh my Jesus lord of YouTube recommendations and my stupidity
Why I never knew oh my girl this piece of God’s work and YouTube never recommended them to me is just a crime that can condemn me
Death
=
I’m actually a Bomshell and Blackjack and i just want to say that OMG is amazing! ♥️
=
I lowkey want OMG collab with Dreamcatcher after this hahaha.
=
Damn! I feel like my heart is about to burst. I'm so proud of Oh My Girl for how far they've come. This performance is truly legendary!! And maaan, my bby girl Seunghee looks so gorgeous!!
=
Binnie ponytail, YooA blond bangs and Arin makeup added 100 years of my lifespan
=
I always love the reactions of Oh My Girl's Seunghee and AOA's Hyejeong the most
=
DAMN..I REALLY" LOVE THIS!!❤️❤️
=
4:09 - 4:11 Oh My Girl's time to attack and show people what they're made off
=
COMEFORMYGIRLSEUNGHEE
=
*ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT MIMI'S RAP?!* She said it was getting harder to breathe and I physically stopped breathing
=
Seunghee, Hyojung, and Yooa are such great performers and have amazing stage presences
Arin and Jiho's visuls are unreal
Mimi is such a great rapper I was shook
And Binnie's long ponytail slayed me
Gidle is personally my favorite among the groups but OMG IS SO UNDERRATED I HOPE THEY GAIN MORE POPULARITY AND WIN MORE AWARDS AFTER QUEENDOM
=
Muito foda, essas minas estão cada vez mais incríveis
=
You know, Only freaking awesome show can make people feel like this 4:31
=

So proud!
=
So Happy...

=
Ayyyy they're so *SLAAAAYYYYY*
=
Now...Chanmi  knows the reason why her lil sister loves OMG. 
=
Queens are all beautiful but Seunghee, Binnie and Arin made me put my gay goggles
=
Nem da pra acreditar que eu vi elas pessoalmente elas são o sinônimo de PERFEIÇÃO ♥️♥️
=
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
Oh my girl is the kind of group where every member shines, from vocals to rap to dance to visuals.
It's really such a mystery why they're underappreciated.
=
2:49
=
I think seunghee win over sunbae's heart. I really like her :)
=
I'm so proud of are girls this is what I've been watching for years from before they even debuted now the world knows!
=

=

=
SORRY BUT OHMYGIRL IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL GIRL GROUP 
SLAAAAY!!!!
=
The things that i like in oh my girl is they’re not trying hard to be cute and sexy. Simple an artist, entertainer, an performers. A diverse artist
=
2019 is a lovely and rising year for OH MY GIRL...
#edit..got many like from awesome MIRACLE... LET'S GET OUR GIRL SHINE SO BRIGHT IN FINAL QUEENDOM
=
Guysss stre*m their song guerilla.
=
Still cant believe Binnie is just a "vocalist" like whaaat? 
=
This queendom isn't so bad. I can see a lot of talented girls in here. Can't wait to have a second batch if ever they continue this competition.
=
In a way that Twilight is miracle’s favorite b-side on Remember Me Album, I’m glad they showcased it also on this show. Seems like the crowd loves it. It is time for them to stop sleeping on Twilight  who knew it would fit the vampire concept so well? ‍♀️ mad props to the dancers as well! OMG and their team is working real hard for their performances each day and I appreciate that so much 
=
This is such an amazing performance ❤❤❤❤ it gets more exciting towards the end and I love it.. ❤❤❤❤
=
Theory
-Jiho and Mimi are witches who don’t feel lost at first
- During the whole song Mimi always smiles. She’s getting the victims. 
- Arin is captivated when she’s the only one to be surrounded by the dancers while others are dancing 3:15 . Then the whole team are captivated when the dancers stand behind them all. 4:04 No dancers try to posses Mimi and Jiho, cuz they are in dark side already. 
- Dance with only lasers shows that they are all possessed
=
I really am glad I started following them since Cupid era.
Their growth is soooo promising.
I'm crying.
=
Yll thats OH MY GIRL
=
Arin is a freaking GODDES!!!
=
Wow I just...I love them so much and I’m so glad that we live in a timeline where they got to do an epic stage performance of twilight!! I love Mimi’s rewrite of the rap too, it’s such a lovely addition
=
I can't count how many goosebumps I got while watching this. MY QUEEN SLAYS AS ALWAYS
=
So no one's gonna talk about how Mimi slayed her rap part ugh  She is so killing it! Damn  She will be included of my favorite girl rappers' list haha
=
Omg I am just fall in love with them
=
their performance really said like "EAT THIS BIJ, WE CAN DO ANY CONCEPTS PERFECTLY!"
=
Oh my girl always have some fresh and unique concept whenever they perform on queendom stage
=
Oh My Girl really shine on the stage ☀️☀️☀️They all did a great job & deserve more    Proud to be Miracle 
=
This is what we called a MASTERPIECE. OH MY GIRL IS A MASTER OF CONCEPTS. and that is an absolute law.
=
seunghee is so beautiful 
=
I didn't realize that Yooa using Wig , hahaha look so Natural~~~
=
How fast did I click when I saw this pop on my feed? FAST! Lol
=
Binnie can choke me with her long hair and I'd still be grateful  
Oh my girl has done it again... *legends*
=
Binnie ❤
=
My FAVORITE girl group of all time Oh My Girl!!! They can sing!  They can dance! And they are all beautiful!! Those 3 things are a dangerous weapon!!! PS. YOOA, The BEST girl group dancer ever!!
=
 
Congratulations to the girls again The choreography of Twilight is really great. Vampire theme，As if it’s really like a movie 「The Twilight Saga」
=
Mimi Yooa and Jiho should be in a unit.
They slayed so damn hard in the dance break.
=
Seunghee-nimm... So proud of you!!!
=
OMG performance so far has always been epic <3
=
YOU GUYS MUST GO TO WATCH THE FULL CAM VER
=
This performance from the girls make me appreciate Oh my girl, seunghee was on fire tonight...lurvin her duality, she can be a total goof ball comedian off stage, but so collected and on point performer  Yooa's new blonde hair is The ultimate hair goals...
Plus Hyejeong's reaction is 
=
I love Oh My Girl 
=
ARIN ❤️❤️
=
SWEAR THE ONE WITH THE CORSET HER WIG KEEPS MISPLACING DURING THE WHOLE SONG
=
Mereka semakin ✨✨
=
Oh My Queen 
=
This show is just turning them all blonde, slowly but surely
=
After the first round they've been stepping up their game so hard.
=
since queendom i've been falling in love with oh my girl they're sooooo talented and they have really good songs
=
They never disappoint with their performances. I'm glad they're gaining more attention from this show. It's what they deserve. I hope they can win in the final round
=
THEY DID NOT COME TO PLAY.
=
Oh My Girls is finally getting the appreciation and attention they deserve. For a long time, I was frustrated to see them being under-rated and under-appreciated. 
When talking about great Idol vocalists, hardly anyone mentions Seunghee or Hyojung. When talking about top Idol dancers , Yooa is never mentioned. Talking about Idol rappers, you never hear Mimi's name. Visuals in Idol groups, you never hear Jiho or Arin.
OMG can easily be top 5 among girl groups for vocals, or visuals, or dancing, rapping, teamwork, stage performance, complicated dance formations, variety skills, but they get ignored for a long time.
Other than Mamamoo, which other girl group has got 4 members invited to King of Mask Singer? Even Yooa, who is the main dancer, is skilled enough as a vocalist to be asked to participate in King of Masked singer. They are a group that is full of talent and skills.
I hope they can now reach the top tier among girl groups, they deserve it.
=
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE THIS BOP WAS JUST A B-SIDE. QUEEN OH MY GIRL !!
=
Let's applaud Jiho ideas!!
=
Binnie's hair looks so good on her 
=
They gave us blonde Yooa, therefore they should be given 1st place
=
I’m nit a fan but ALL MEMBER’S FACIAL EXPRESSION HERE IS BILLION 
AMAZING
=
I don't know this group that well, but this was my favorite performance of this round. I'm a fan now.
=
I couldn't be more proud of these girls! When they debuted, they had to be introduced as B1A4's sister group. Now, they have already made a name on their own. I've been with them since Cupid and seeing all these praises makes my heart full.
=
What Iove with oh my girl's stages is they always have it planned well.  The intro will make you curious and gives anticipation on what's coming next.
Then they start the song with the usual tone. Then  rap part starts to build up for the bridge connecting to the the chorus of the song. It's not a momentum killer at all.
Then here goes another bridge that builds the anticipation for the climax, like the dance break, high notes etc and ending it with elegance.
=
my god how do you even hold your head up let alone dance with that heavy af hair piece that’s amazing
=
OMG!
This is the best performance so far! I Kinda like it though and they're so fine and keep slay but those outfits tho,whoa!!!
They looks like a Vampire!
=
I started this show hoping gidle or mamamoo would win cause they are two of my favorite girl groups but honestly I've fallen for oh my girl and I can't get up so now I want them to win and I'm stanning lol
=
COME ON MIRACLES! 
LETS GIVE ALL THE LOVE THESE QUEENS DESERVE!
SEUNGHEE AND HER INSANE VOCALS, OH MY GIRL!
=
 amazing ♥️
Love this song 
=
*1M BEFORE 24 HOURS!*
=
Mimi’s rap is out of this world! She is sooo underrated :((( I want to see her rap more in the future❤️
=
Im proud of arin  her face expression is amazing! Compare to their old Twilight performance, she has improved so much. Jiho is like a vampire princess and binnie.. CAUGHT MY ATTENTION THE MOST
=
You could see it by the way the audience react to them. They enjoyed it. Omg deserves 1st ❤
=
oh my girl really have 1001 concept they can fit anything
=
Fidjdsidjsusb THEY ARE SO COOL ARGHHHH ❤❤❤❤❤ OH MY GIRL IS MY FAVORITE GROUP AFTER LOONA! THATS IT! I DECIDED.
=
They’re stunning
=
Let's get the view to 1m. Since OMG showed us their hard work, we must show them too. Fighting

This is lovely I love the song 
=
THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. THEY ALWAYS NAIL IT WITH THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS DAMN THEIR GAZE EATS ME
=
When you think that a group like this is not even nominated for Mamas... so sad to see. 
But we all know that they don't need prizes to show that they are one of the best groups out there
=
 whaaaaaat!!!!!
=
Cuantos Fans Latinos de Oh My Girl?

=
Queendom made me fall in love with all this gg.
If OMG or (G)I-DLE aren't 1st & 2nd, I dont care which one in what place, I'll blame Msnake..
=
啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊，噜妹太棒啦！！！！概念精灵
=
SEUNGHEEEE
=
Perfeitaaaaas
=
YASSSSSSSSSS{
=
WOW.
=
I honestly like this part4:44
=
every week l feel surprise when i see oh my girl 
=
Why am I feeling proud— hiding my tears
=
HEOL! DAEBAK!
=
I still can’t believe this song was just for this show, it’s literally one of my favorite from them.
=
Still can't believe they didn't win
=
You don’t have to be aggressive to be powerful. This proves.
=
*Oh My Girl with dreses*
Me: They look Small
*Oh My Girl With Pants*
Me: They are so tall
=
i cannot believe that people are still sleeping on seunghee, her stage presence and her vocals are immaculate
=
Oh my girl s vocal not joke. Also seunghee best vocalist
=
I need a season 2 with Dreamcatcher, CLC & Loona.
=
The best chorus of 2019?
=
This song needs a MV. And I need to see them performe this more than once
=
Seunghee and Hyojung's voices combined remind me of Taeyeon and Jessica. They really have great chemistry together i-
=
why no one is talking about yooa? she looks literally amazing
=
Holyshit didn’t know they have such solid vocals.
=
Besides giving AOA the opportunity to establish themselves as a phenomenal OT5, I'm most grateful to this show for really giving us the chance to see what an amazing group Oh My Girl is (and Lovelyz as well). I knew of them, but never pushed myself to check them out. What a group of wonderful, talented, sweet girls who become entirely boss onstage. I looked forward to their stages the most right after AOA every week, and they absolutely killed each one of them. Their cover of Destiny was beyond amaaaaazing, and I love Guerilla so much. Thank you so much for introducing me to this group. I think it's safe to say I can add Miracle to my group of fandoms. Now choosing a bias is going to be hard as I already love them all, but I'm leaning towards Yooa or Seunghee...
=
Who else are still having goosebumps despite listening to this too many times?
=
Holly crap this song’s vocals almost made me cry
=
damn that red haired girl with a ponytail got some crazy vocalsssss
=
Lets cheer for oh my girl the black horse of this generation! 2020 will be their year! I'm anticipating their comeback!!!
=
"If oh my girl spent the past few years ploughing the fields and making the land fertile, then we hope that next year is the year we make a plentiful harvest."
-Choi Hyojung
A reference to secret garden.
Miracles, let's give them another Miracle and give our girls what they deserve for working so hard every passing year!
=
This is one of Oh my girl best stage to be honest. This girl group has so many talents and visual(s) for real, after this show, I stand them. 
YooA’s visual is amazing somehow with this western style make up !!!!! Salute !!!
=
Thanks to queendom I am a Oh my girl fan. I knew them of course but this show made me realise how good they are!
=
i never commented in any artist video asking for comeback yet right now, i really want OMG to comeback right now!!! my heart cannot wait any longer..
=
Seunghee. This generations most underrated vocalist confirmed.
=
I wasn't a fan of OMG before but Seunghee stole my heart in Queendom, so I'm here now
=
This performance is like a sub group performance.
Hyojung, Seunghee, Binnie, and YooA ft. Mimi, Arin, and Jiho
=
"Even if I was to be born again, I want to become an oh my girl member again with the same members"
- Yooa, 2k19, JoyNews' 15th Anniversary Interview
#OhMyGirl also ranked at about top grade of getting the most remarkable growth in 2019 as well as the most anticipated singer of the 2020 in the recent survey of entertainment industry officials on JoyNews’s 15th anniversary
=
OH MY GIRL really stand out in Queendom. All members are good vocalist even the rapper. well, you know some other girl idol made it to the group because of their visual and dancing skills only.
=
Oh my girl is the only group that made a bigger changes on this programme
=
I don't how many times have I replay 3:43 moment. Seunghee has being so gorgeous
=
Guerilla's YooA should be viral. She's so gorgeous
=
Idk why but I really like when they say ‘do it do it’
=
The more i listen to this song the more i like it
=
I want oh my girl comeback with this song or comeback with this concept
=
Seunghee’s voice can be delicate like an ice feather or strong like a glacier the duality I cantttttt
=
still coming here everyday after 1.5 months..... its really an amazing performance..... Oh My Girl will shine bigger in next year seriously... 
=
This is the best song in this entire show. Because of this SONG I MIGHT STAN 
=
WOW! They really showed everyone just how GREAT this group is!! So proud of them all!!!
=
mnet please make a special stage on m-countdown for them to perform any of their queendom performance (destiny/twilight/guerilla) I'd love to see it
=
Binnie hit those notes! Im so happy for her that she got more lines than in the old songs
=
The thing I liked about this show is that it exposed me to other groups.  Yooa is amazing.  Wow
=
They don't need to win. They just need to make a name for themselves. A reputable one. They made it!
=
Seunghee is the definition of girl crush
=
Mimi is SO INCREDIBLY STUNNING in this performance
That hairstyle suits her so so well
I'm in love
=
come here and listen everyday... I think they should be No.1 of Queendom !!!!!! They win 1st place 2nd time but cant win at the end..........not fair.....
=
I think Oh My Girl has collectively the best vocalists in this generation of younger idols  I love all styles of Kpop and loved all of the Queendom final songs, but the way the main vocalists carry the chorus in this song really makes me feel something, especially combined with meaning of the song.
=
New year programs are coming = new oh my girl performances yey!
=
Hyojung: The queen who ruled the fairy realm
Binnie: The princess
Seunghee: The war general who always looks fierce
Jiho & Mimi: The two most deadly warriors
Arin: The young oracle
YooA: In her own world dancing and looking fabolous 
=
I think this song is beautiful because everyone sings so good
=
Oh My Girl is one of the most talented and underrated girl groups in K-Pop right now, PERIOD. Every member is so talented AND a visual. Thank god they went on Queendom to showcase their skills <3
=
YooA needs this styling and makeup for a comeback... She always looks pretty but THIS LOOK is perfect for her. Goddess.
=
All of the girls slayed! Yooa’s vocal, Seunghee’s queen walk, Binnie’s vocal, Mimi’s rap, Hyojoung’s presence, Arin’s dance moves, Jiho’s fierceness! In short, they’ve become limitless!
=
i'm sorry Oh My Girl, i just recognize you after joining Queendom.
=
Hyojung also looks stunning!!! She is like a shinning star!
=
This song gives me goosebumps throughout the entire song, too bad they didn't win
=
Too danger . I love OH MY GIRL LIKE THIS . PERFECT . EXELLENT .  
Black and while . THIS IS BEAUTIFUL OH MY GIRL EVER I SEEN .
Best high voice . Every thing .
Hope for more VIDEO / MV like this .
Fighting my idol !!!!! <3
=
Des 2, 2019. Cant stop watching this.
=
please let Oh My Girl release this song with a music video!
=
They look aboslutely beautiful. I really like this kind of concept on them. Through Queendom I became a fan ! :D
=
#OhMyGirl also ranked at about top grade of getting the most remarkable growth in 2019 as well as the most anticipated singer of the 2020 in the recent survey of entertainment industry officials on JoyNews’s 15th anniversary
=
Gosh dang this is epic. It should have a MV
=
2:50 GIRL THAT POWER WALK OMG STEP ON ME PUNCH ME DESTROY ME IDC
=
Oh My Girl never fails to release amazing music.
=
Pirate Queen concept, I feel this song just keeps on ordering you to never to give up on anything  It's so inspiring
=
nah, they were ROBBED of that win. They hella outdid everyone else. The only reason they didn't win is because it was a popularity contest and first place had a bigger fandom going in, smh.
=
why no one talking about Binnie's high notes tho
Binnie shine in this performance and also her visual as usual
=
THE FIRST LINE WAS SO POWERFUL
=
I cant help it everytime seunghee's on the screen just cant breath. Much love from egypt seunghee-aaa!!!♥♥♥♥
=
the winners for me! i love them so much ❤️
=
We need to discuss about Seunghee's vocal. Oh my girl...your voice is so precious ♡♡♡
=
YooA's chest voice... thats all, thats the comment
=
8 High Notes !!!! Jesus !!!
=
Queendom is what happens to idols when their company’s allow artistic freedom and im living for this.
=
Everything about this is the most amazing thing I have ever seen
=
oh my god binnie high note
=
This deserves more attention.
=
You will never forget this performance since you watched it the 1st time.I think I'll watch this at least once per week until 2049.
=
The lyrics are exactly what Oh My Girl did to me.
=
the best performance at queendom
=
Omg this is one of the best performances I’ve watched!!
I had my mouth open I was shook 
Queens are slaying
=
Haven't really heard much of Oh My Girl's music except for Liar Liar and this song really surprised me. It's my favourite out of all the Queendom songs (even though im more biased to Park Bom haha). If there's anyone that can recommend any of their songs that are similar to this style that would be great!!
=
finally watching the queendom final performances and this blew me away, oh my girl are such an amazing talented group
=
Queens look stunning , i think this is OMGs best stage fashion from the ourfits to the hair and accessories <3
=
3:53 her voice so strong what's her name
=
They look beautiful than the usual, and they look so powerful ugh, such an amazing performance
Also Seunghee vocals killed me, and Hyojung and YooA look amazing here (they always do but they catch my eye here and I can't stop looking at them)
=
*OMG Fairy Crushes*
Only in OMG will you ever see the most feminine and prettiest girls wreck you like an oppa in the most elegant way possible. 
=
"We (Oh my girl members) kept watching the moment when Secret Garden went #2 on Melon's real-time chart. It's the first time I've heard it. I have to stream more diligently. “The song was coming out and the rankings were going up little by little. We didn't have a cell phone at the time, so we put all our heads together on the tablet PC and checked it. "Let's go to bed after checking just one more hour”. We watched hour and hour again finally the song went #2. We couldn't sleep and went to the next day schedule. The members cried, and we couldn't believe it, so our hands trembled.”
-OMG
=
I really like the pre-chorus of this song. It is so pretty yet powerful at the same time.
=
You Know? All Of Oh My Girl Performance have A Story
Secret Garden:when they Live happily And Flower Everywhere,When There Are Just Happiness
Destiny: When They know the destiny, there are no such a never ending happiness, They're got attack by unknown And Feel Just Really2 Hurt
Twilight: The time when they still fighting with their own Feeling,to get Strong and Said To Themselves That You Are Strong And Have The same Power With Other
Guerilla: It's Time To attack and shown who is the best
=
Phone? Galaxy
Game? Cold War
App? Sing Stealer
Girl Group? Oh My Girl 
-Oh my girl, 2k19, vlive

=
me: best MAMA performance!
others: but  MAMA didnt inv..
me: as i said!
=
Their vocal are perfect and performance too!
=
Thanks M-Net u bring under rated girl grup become shining with their talent ^^v
=
I hope they have comeback with this song
=
Why do I feel like I wanna cry upon hearing and seeing this?? Our girls have grown so much and they're just....*GLOWING*
=
Waiting the MV for this amazing song. I want it to be historical setting with some war and fantasy creatures 
=
Can we do an official release of this song please? Full MV and everything.. god they deserve more!!!
=
That harmonize by Binnie and Hyojung at the end tho! Amazingggg
=
Is it just me, or does Yooa kinda look like Angelina Jolie?! She has that kind of sexy iconic vibe to her ya know.
=
OHMYGIRL never come to play; no matter the concept, they just continue to slay.
=
If someone sees me bald, don't blame oh my girl. My roots were too weak.
=
oh my girl never disappointed 
=
Bests song in queendom
=
i have always been an Oh My Girl fan but this song and preformance gave me chills and made me cry from pure disbelieve of how amazing it was
=
WOW! They looked so strong and stunning with this concept. That the prove of versatility from OH MY GIRL! They all look so gorgeous.
=
Epic performance look like a musical drama
=
the best performance ever 
=
The way Hyojung uses her hair in this performance. 
=
I fell in love with OMG through this program! I love the rap break too its so fierce!
=
Binnie you stole my heart
=
Oh My Girl added the element of maturity and femininity to this song which they executed BEAUTIFULLY and all the while keeping their signature whimsical, elegant, and bittersweet tone to their music which I fricking love and their stage presence and expression and everything is so powerful, you can really feel what they’re singing AHG QUEENS
=
THIS DESERVES #1 QUEENDOM!
=
*FAIRY CRUSH QUEENS RISE*
=
I've been a Miracle since their debut. The improvement they have showed over the years is mind blowing. Not hating on Mamamoo, but OMG deserved the win.
=
They captivated me from their Closer era. And now I am a proud momma of this gg that they're getting more recognition thanks to queendom
=
Gonna stan oh my girl because.of queendom ahhas my bias are hyojung and yooa but still open to learn more about the girls 
=
All of them did great but SEUNGHEE’S PART <3 IM IN LOVE
=
You can see how Yooa was nervous in the beginning. Her hands were shaking in 1:41! 
But they did well and this was my favourite song. Love this concept, suits OMG a lot!
=
Almost of them are main vocal, daebak :")
=
Binnie could be omg visual. She's so pretty and talented as well. I love her voice.
=

=

=
the beginning with the ropes is sooo creative
=
That moment when Binnie belts together with Hyojung .. Oh my baby girl :)
Though this performance somehow lost Jiho and Arin .. o_O
=
I literally got chills
=

=

3:42 killed me. Seunghee just killed me from 3:30 - 3:45
=
I got goosebumps that was just WOW
=
Thats it! Visuals and Talent 
=
Oh my girl‘s song, it's like the revolutionary army is going to revolt and win, and  (G)I-DLE is going to be the queen who took the throne on their own.
This song is like a queen, a song that really fits the concept of the Queendom program.
When I first listened to Oh my girl’s song, I thought it would be nice to have a sword dance, but I still can't get over it,,, ♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
Binnie's high note ❤️
=
mimi is my favorite rapper next to moonbyul
=
I have this song on my phone, but I feel like I have to come back to this video (and (G)-Idle) for the full experience.
=
OH MY GIRL the queens of vocals.
=

=
This gave me goosebumps, I'm speechless
=
Their vocal line still gives me shivers
=
Amazing performance, just hope Arin can have a bit more screen time.
=
Seunghee walks like a supermodel
=
I think their Outfits were the best out of all the final stages. So prettyyyy 
=
Seunghee is such a charismatic vocalist, that's rare
=
I've fallen love into oh my girl because of queendom
=
The way they absolutely destroyed this stage... no words just mindblown
=
Mimi without bangs!
Oh my girl!!!! 
=
I need season2 Wjsn, Clc, April,Dreamcatcher.
=
I really miss JinE.
I hope she's doing better now and is proud of where OMG is now :)
=
Queendom has made me a oh my girls fan <3
=
I have watched this so many times, but I still get goosebumps. I'm a Miracle here in PH. Keep it up ladies!!!
=
Can they please release the MV for this masterpiece?! 
=
thanks to queendom, i got to know a lot more about kpop girl groups. i especially feel for this group, they all have sweet voice.
=
OMG BINNIE THAT HIGH NOTE SURPRISED ME
=
seunghee really gave her all
=
this is so freaking beautiful i cry every time watching this stage. so powerful.
=
3:43 am i the only one mesmerized by this scene???!!! No one is talking abt it??
=
I love this show because it introduced me to groups i'd never listen too now I cant get enough of all of the groups
=
best song of the final episode
=
Geez.. this gave me Infinite vibes. I love it. and I miss Infinite.
=
i love their hairstyles. i cant stop looking at it.
=
4:11 these high notes make me soft
=
Oh my girl mamá award , seoul music , golden disk. This Group deserve  this.
=
By far the best Queendom final song. Not because of the song, but the way they present it. I'm happy to see OMG stepping into another concept, although their usual concept made them popular. Great girls, great energy, great perfomance.  Hope JinE is watching this, being proud. Keep it up, Girls. Oh my...GURL ❣
=
wth goosebumps
=
amazing, addictive
=
*breathes in*
*DON'T YOU JUST LOVE IT WHEN YOU STAN TALENT?*
=
Maravilhosasssss ♥️♥️♥️
=
I can’t stop watching this performance everything about it is amazing from the choreography to the vocals
=
this is not "sexy concept" or "girl crush", this is just pure power. I'm so proud to be a miracle today
=
I knew this group cause of this program
=
Seunghee and beenie be slayin every stage in kindom staph
=
WE NEED MUSIC VIDEO OF GUERILLA!!!! 
=
mimi looks so frICKEN SICK!!!!! acknowledge her thank u
=
I love this concept for OMG (Guerilla and Twilight) . It fits them so well
=
This song should be called The chills, because I have so many of them right now
=
I love they performance!!! So good! So touched! 
=
It's okay oh my girl has gained lot of fans through queendom. As a miracle for almost 4 years, I'm so glad that they participated in this show and get the recognition they deserve. I believe that their next comeback will be doing very well. Let's cheer and continute to support these previous girls. I hope they can take a break.
=
Seunghee stop, my bias is Jiho, I don't need this bias wreckage 
=
OMG! Jiho blonde with that hairstyle looks like LOONA's Kim Lip.
=
MIRACLES ARE SHAKING IM SHOOK
=
My winners!! <3
=
I was really pinning for them to win! (1)versatile af (2)power vocals (3)concept queen [w/c they come up on their own] (4)consistent
They had the best song and stage among all six teams.
=
Really like this song
=
OMG
OH MY GOSH !!!
=
somebody please help me with their names, I’ve only known YooA because I’ve been following her since the collab with her brother Junsun Yoo
=
Oh my God, they are trying to kill me
=
oh my girl didnt come to play!!!! they may have been considered the 'weaker' or dark horses in the competition against more established groups but they prove that they are so strong vocally, in dancing, stage presence everything!! honestly so happy to see them get the recognition they deserve :') and this concept really suits them a lot, perfect balance of their signature 'fairy-tale/magic' sound and vocal power!!
=
Binnie is so good! I love her...
=
The most inspire song by OMG 
=
Fairy turned be Monster 
=
Waiting for mv
=
This show truly exceeded my expectations. Not only to see great performances but to see the process of how a stage comes to life. This was especially impressive in how Oh My Girl members planned their performance. These girls truly seem like a group of creatives, and performers that know their strengths and their vision, and who work as a team so harmoniously. Really applaud the show for celebrating Korean girl groups as not just pretty faces but as passionate artists.
=
I GOT GOOSEBUMPSS
=
I really love this song!!
=
arin ma baby!!!!
=
I love yooa's voice 
=
4:16 
=
Are they Oh my girl or Oh my god they’re so amazing
=
if it weren't for seunghee's trot version cover of ed sheeran's shape of you, then i would never have seen this performance this day
=
Arghhh i fall for oh my girl. I’m already stan them
=
超級好聽
=
Fight for your dreams!!!!
=
ビニちゃんのパートが最近どんどん増えて嬉しいです
=
Ok, someone please tell me why this perfection makes me want to cry ❤️
=
Been miracle since cupid and my girls always make me proud until I flooded in my own tears. They just sooo beautiful and talented and i love you
=
I guess I'm late but I just noticed that their opening positions is similar to the ending pose of twilight. 
Oh My Girl's doing it again. 
=
Thank you for the reactions  (I loved Queendom)
(AOA made us Laugh), (Park Bom made us cry), (Lovelyz was Lovey), (Oh My Girl 'Concept' Queens or cry babies?), (Mamamoo being Mamamoo), & {(G)I-DLE can remix any song 1,000 times and still sound Awesome!}
=
Still my favorite! 
=
3:35 THIS PART REALLY BREAKES ME EVERYTIME
THIS SONG MEANS SO MUCH FOR THEM AND LOOK HOW FAR THEY HAVE COME IM SOOO PROUD LOVE YOU MY GIRLS 
=
All groups were amazing in the finale but there's just something about Oh My girl's performance, song and vocals that keeps me coming back. Proud of these girls, proud miracle. Excited for the MV and Encore! hwaiting!
=
They should definitely do this concept for a comeback, I could see this definitely winning.
=
their vocals!!! 
=
Okay so I think I’m gonna STAN this group. I was never interested in them and always skipped over their songs. Today I decided to see what this whole show was about and I am not disappointed! From Vocals, Rapping to Choreography and can we just talk about the song production! OMG
=
Happy 3M!!❤
=
Seunghee！！！！
=
Seungheeeeeee ♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
Woooowww 
=
Definitely one of my favourites- strong vocals, not overly dramatic, a really good song I'd actually listen to. A lot of the other performances were underwhelming.
=
im really shockeddd . labbbbbbbb oh my girll ❤❤❤❤
=
Performance and live vocals are incredible!!! Can't wait for the MV... Any news?
=
o #1 moral é delas..... mamamoo ganhou por favoritismo entregando trabalhos meia boca (em comparação com tudo o que elas já fizeram fora do reality)
=
Mimi looks so hot in this performance
=
No one talks about Seunghee queen of expression?
=
Damn the voices. Stan
=
Hyojung so pretty!
=
Just ignore me, i’m flooded with my own proud tears
=
Seunghee
Hyojung
Binnie
Yooa
Can be main vocal in another group
=
YooA please stop killing me
=
Just learned that if they make this a MV it will be a special stage when performed on stage not a comeback stage  but the best thing is the company has the right to do the MV rather than Mnet 
=
I’ve never listened to them since I watched this Queendom. They’re all really talented but so underrated and they didn’t get enough attention and they do too much cute concepts. But these shows in Queendom really proved that their cute faces not only can do cute!! They are fierce, gorgeous, stunning, and also girl crush. So, after this Queendom end!! Please give them more attention because they really DESERVE IT!
=
Arin's screen time = 5 sec
=
seunghee is just so... w-wow...
=
Seunghee's high notes are power
=
i feel powerful by hearing this song by them
=
Underdogs of queendom, i have no words to describe how proud i am
=
Please release a MV of this
=
You can tell that Seunghee was in the damn right zone SHE SLAYED
=
I NEED A MV RIGHT NOW!
=
I love MAMAMOO(they’re the girl group that got me into kpop) and oh my girl but after watching this show I was like damn omg definitely deserved to win it all (part of me is still happy for mmm though the struggle of being a multi stan is being sad that one group you love didn’t win while still being happy another group you love did) but you better believe that everyone knows oh my girl’s name after this show
=
i cant stop listen to this:v im not OMG stan but i love this song
=
Just bring this performance to MAMA 2019!!!
Who's agree??
|
|
|
V
Hit Like!! Make it happen MIRACLE!!
=
Minha outras rainhas! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
goosebumps! the buildup is amazing! dsjflasdjfsalkdjfalsdjfsdafj asljkfsadf
=
Dancing with the ropes is such a unique idea and looked so cool! Also Seunghee is such a badass, when she walks forward to centre stage she is so charismatic! 
It felt like every week Oh My Girl kept on impressing me and I think I became a fan bc of this show 
What a great stage, congrats Oh My Girl, you all did so well! Moomoo sending love 
=
the song is very good, especially the part when the lyric said "look closely, the walls that once surrounded you are collapsing like dominos" And the dancer's collaps after that... so detail, right..??
=
THEY SHOULD HAVE WONNNNNNN
=
also check their performances on inmortal song
=
please create MV for this song 
=
Seunghee and Hyojong were so good with the high notes!
=

AMO LA CANCIÓN <3
=
OMG songs never disappointed,,you are always the winner
=
i naver see concept OMG like this, so proud
=
Vocals and visuals for days!!!!!!
=
OMG has seriously been the dark horse. I never really paid attention to them, but they really proved they can do different concepts while retaining that signature OMG feel. Love them!!
=
2019 IS REALLY THE YEAR FOR THESE GIRLS OH MY GOD THEY GOT SECOND PLACE GUYSSSSS AND IM SO PROUD OF THEM!!!! AND THE STYLIST TOO!!!! PLEASE KEEP UP WITH THE GOOD WORK AND AH I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT THANK U MNET

=
2:50
=
The song that made me stan 100%
=
Mimi ma queen
=
SEUNGHEE!!!!!!!
=
I feel so proud of Binnie. She always mentions how she thinks she is lacking of skills. She is singing so confidently in this stage even with the high note. Time to @mimpd for the next content suggestion: a collaboration with binnie will be perfect
=
Sooo nobody's gonna say how pretty hyojung is in this performance waaaaaaaaaaaaa
=
Seungheeee!!
=
Jenny lost a abscess from a squad❤
=
YooA is the main dancer but I love her voice the most. What even like how is this even possible.
=
Yo I wasnt expecting THAT
=
YooA ♥ ♥ ♥
=
YooA
=
My girls did so well, whoever win the competition, lets support all groups since all of them are queens 
=
วงนี้ไม่มีอารินหรอ กล้องไม่แพลนเลยอะ เคียดดดดั
=
holy crap mimi is so stunning here
=
BINNIE PERIODTTTTTTTTYDTSYDUUDUDU
=
Son tan buenas cantando Muy bueno!
=
BINNIE !!!!!
=
I just realized that this song is if Vouge and SSFWL had a child
=
My favorite for sure!!!!!!
=
Tbh oh my girl deserved first place. They really gave their all for this show every time
=
They deserve so much better  They are physical monsters they sold 2.7b on a single album lol but seriously. They deserve much more recognition.
=
Oh My Girl didn't need to win. They just needed to be there. They already won by proving everyone wrong and showing them what they could do.
=
Seunghee high noteeeee
=
oh man i got GOOSEBUMPS
and this is why i have always loved OMG <3 like, they could do any concept beautifully!
=
they got the most attention from the show, despite the winner, this was their show
=
Oh my girl should do this stage at mama! It is gonna be awesome
=
The song is just such a BOP! the girls worked really hard
=
Its like Mamamoo walked away with the trophy, but Oh My Girl walked away leaving everyone in shook and regrets from new fans. Leaving the entire building and stage smeared with their presence. We are Oh My Girl...
=
when seunghee sing  3:35 "can you hear your name shining?" with that vocals and hand gesture! is just perfect! that is express the music and lyrics!
=
I love this so muchhhhh thank you Queendom for letting me know about these amazing girls im totally in love
=
Their vocal no joke ❤️
=
STAN OH MY GIRL!!!! I am still amazed by how fantastic they are n seunghee vocals give me goosebumps ✨❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
=
AMAZING PERFORMANCE!!!
i hope that after queendom people truly realize that oh my girl is actually one of the top girlgroups out there
=
THANKS QUEENDOM, NOW I KNOW AND STAN THESE TALENTED GIRLS! OMG FIGHTING!
=
I came to Queendom for Mamamoo, but OMG caught my attention and never let go! So happy they've finally gotten the stage they deserve!
=
4:31 I really like her makeup
=
this performance!!!!! I LOVE MY GIRLS!!! plus the lyrics are amazing!!!! Would miracles mind if i go fight starship while playing this song, cause it fits so perfectly about fighting for love !
=
Oh my girl created Art!!!!!!  
=
They can be whatever fairies they want :) that’s oh my girl
=
I'm really falling in love with Mimi's tone when she raps
=
damnn the highnotes
=
BINNIE HIGHNOTE OMGGFGFFNHHYGTHYBYGHHH
=
This is awesome
=
I'm addicted to this
=
don't know bout u, but this song is magical
=
i know "oh my girl" exist even before queendom & its because of twice (group i super loved ahhhk) who have been fangirling over them. but i didn't bother looking on their perfs or listening to their songs. i watched queendom because of mamamoo & g idle. but throughout the competition, oh my girl made me realize what i was missing out. they continuously improve and showed people their talent. now i know why my loves (twice) stan these queens. these girls deserve more!! lets not sleep on these talented queens. i love em all but seung hee really got my heart hahaha 
++ i'm a new fan pls help me HAHAHAHA i wanna get to know oh my  girl more
=
ay no las amo muchísimo
=
OMG!!!!!!!!
=
I’ve never been so in awe and I’m officially stanning
=
Been a fan since the beginning. Talent will out
=
Actually I have known that OMG is very talented but honestly I didn't know they were that good :'>>> very appreciate their hard work. Wish them for the best, they deserve it.
=
I think the difference between g idle's final performance and oh my girl is that oh my girl chose to show their overall strength as a girl group. Their talent and all. They took turns in shining. While g idle's performance focus more on the music arrangements,power and visual which is not bad but I kinda find oh my girl's performance more passionate(?) That's all. Im not hating on any of the girls but I was kinda furious at first as to why g idle did not won but seeing other groups perform it was really hard to judge all of them.
=
4:26
=
she no beautiful 0:51
=
Their Vocals are so amazing, rapper is so cool,,,,,great
=
I doubt they will have a comeback with this song as title track. This will broke their throat though
=
4:25
=
Waooooo daebak
=
It has been confirmed that Yooa is the real life of Bratz 
=
I don't know how to describe. This song has girl crush vibe but omg still retain the fairy concept haha.
=
I can imagine LOONA doing a cover dance to this song. The girls did amazing and this song and performance gave me goosebumps! The song production was impressive
=
I only know Hyojung because of Bom but wow, these girls are talented
=
were they actually singing live? i dont hear much difference from the studio version but if this was live well damn Oh my girl is underrated af
=
Carefull with the salute girls...
=
Goose bumps!!!
=
3:43
=
Ocean Them
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
0:45
=
New fans: So who is the main vocal?


Oh my girl: *yes*
=
guerilla being 80% high notes 20% performance vocals and rap from heaven
STAN OMG.
=
oh my girl invented fairy crush, periodt
=
Seunghee was about to fly like a butterfly
=
Hyojung is really pretty in here. We dont deserve this huhuhu
=
Ethereal, unreal fairy queens with a mature twist? Oh My Girl becoming women before my very eyes? Me dead on the floor? All more possible than you think.
=
Gidle sure has cool concept but OMG definitely wins with vocal performance
=
I failed my driving test 3 times and this song gave me motivation to never give up and today  finally I passed my driving test. OMG 
=
I've been following Oh My Girl since Closer era and I'm honestly super proud of them. I've seen their growth, their transition through concepts while still keeping the uniquely Oh My Girl style. Closer-SecretGarden-FifthSeason were honestly their fairy concept holy trinity. Now we have Twilight and Guerilla dreamy girl crush duo. Please continue supporting Oh My Girl even after Queendom because I am sure they will deliver and not disappoint! Also, thank you yoobinnie for constantly improving yourself. I've been a really big fan since Closer and I was so surprised to know she's just a vocalist. I love her vocal color and her visual. Hwaiting Binnie!!! Oh My Girl and Miracles shall walk on the flower path together!
=
This song was definitely the best one if this episode, though I loved g(i)dle performance better, i love this song so much and the stage presence is amazing as well, loved seeing their growth through this show and their popularity grow they deserve it❤
=
We need a Music Video and Dance Practice Version of this.
=
I think i really really really fall in love with YooA.. if I'm pretty enough like she is.. I'm going to Korea and make her my girlfriend..
=
Dayum, Hyojeong is so beautiful. No wonder Seulgi commented her photo. ^^
=
They started with the ribbons and ended with rope. Congratulations OH MY GIRL ❤
=
I'm INLOVE in this performance
=
my god, visuals on point, rap on point, vocal on point, makeup/outfits on point, this stage really showed a different side of them!!!! <3 <3
=
I'm a Neverland and I fell in love with them watching their Queendom performances.  I only know YooA. Can you guys help me out with their names?
=
I'm INLOVE in this performance
=
Im thankful that queendom introduced them to me
=
MY CUTIES MY FAVORITE GROUP SINCE 2016
=
the goosebumps game is good hmm
=
Wooo for me are the ones that deserve to be winners, evolved with each presentation and took care of every detail, presence, good dance, voice and excellent costumes but above all a lot of effort. Num 1
=
Underrated Vocal Queens 
=
YooA make up is so gorgeous
=
Can we get them for mama this year?
=
This song makes me want to do the naruto run....like idk why :)
=
one thing that i love abt queendom is that they really pushed the idols to try performing songs that aren't their styles before this. well done, oh my girl.
=
their stylists did a great job. been listening to this for a couple of days now. next time, i hope they stop giving yooa and binnie full bangs.  yooA's visual here is just lit. 
=
I wish this will be a comeback song I want them to perform and promote this coz this song is a bop
=
I love you omg 
=
this goes so hard at this point of people are still sleeping on omg’s talent and stage presence they’re ignoring them on purpose
=
Came into this show with only mamamoo but came out with idle and omg
=
Beautiful chords, beautiful voices, beautiful lyrics, 
Oh My Girl is PEREFECT
=
I love them more and more. Miracle forever
=
RAINHAS DO KRL
=
Yooa looks like Hara
=
their next comeback should be this concept. its suits them
=
Queedom: So what's the concept this time?
OMG: *New fans try to guess who's our main vocal*
=
I can’t believe they can sing this live with no problems. We Stan talent. Like I have chills
=
Their high note are stable af , like how the hell though ???
=
It’s official. Oh My Girl can do any concept and rock it like no other group.
=
I'm so glad they're getting so much attention from the show
=
It's my first time seeing this girl group and I must say WOW. THE VOCALS!
=
I feel motivated.
=
song wise this would have to be my favorite.honesty anyone who says anyone did better than omg musically in finals needs to reevalute themselves.
=
Seunghee, darling. You didn't had to come so hard, but I'm glad you did.
=
Their choreography is always sooo good to look at. It's like a balm to my eyes.
=
i'm out of breath just litsening to those high notes
=
This reminds me of Cupid but more bad ass ❤️
=
SEUNGHEE & HYOJUNG HIGH NOTE
=
Thanks Queendom for introducing me to such a great group … they killed this performance !!
=
This is elegant power
=
I never have any intention/ interested to check OMG..but since they on Queendom.. i start to stan them..watch all their show and performance.. and everytime they perform on Queendom.. i always cover my mouth and goosebumps all over my body.. I'm crying.. I'm sorry stan them this latee
=
Probably my favorite song out of all the groups, G IDLE had the best visuals and MAMAMOO was the most hype but I feel like the flow of the song was too all over the place. OMG’s song had the perfect transition and felt overall a complete fully realized song. At the end of the day, I’ll be going back to this song to listen to over and over again.
=
Jesus this was the most OMG thing ever but so poweful and majestic. LOVE IT
=
I'm watching this again and thinking how OMG is an excellent dance group but is an excellent vocal group also T_T, like 4 of them can sing like main vocalists, and all of them are stable singers
=
My girl Seunghee be fierce af ❤
=
Yooa her first line kills!!!!
=
HYOJUNG LOOKS REALLY GORGEUS!! AND HELL YEAH, OH MY GIRL WILL SHINE FOREVER!! 
=
They really are BEAUTY GODDESSES
=
oh my girl and mamamoo killed it <33
=
All their voices color are beautiful i think this is one of the main reason by which their songs sound so good
=
OH MY GIRLLLLLLAMANSNNSKAHSJS 
=
My winners <3
=
They got vocals!
=
After live performances, I need Music Videoo
=
The ending is sooooooooooo satisfying
=
The high note oh my god 
Girl*
=
I'm gay for YooA.. *CRYING
=
This is amazing tho
=
Mimi is a godddddddddd
=
2:01 THIS
=
This is the type of music and performance I've waited to see from girl-groups
=
This is oh my girl and their own concept
=
Holy shit they just did that. Who said OMG can only do cute concept bc they can eat this WHOLE
=
Yeeeeeeing gi moring~
=
MY BABIEEEEEEEES 
=
Add them to my Stan list. This Issa certified bop.  I’m blown away.
=
We love main vocal Binnie
=
Já tô esperando o mv dessa música ansiosamente ❤
=
I’m here because they were amazing at queendom
=
This song is insanity, oh my girl is def in my top 3
=
Binnie get that high note @4:11
=
Pelo amor de Deus!! Estou viciada nessa obra-prima!!
=
i''m shocked
=
damn this song has too many high notes
=
Anyone else think their vocal colors really shine here? The combination makes the song really interesting.
=
Seunghee is ready to fly like a butterfly
=
Actually i was started to watch queendom as a MOOMOO, and ended up being part of MIRACLE  I'm so proud of OMG
=
Name of the rapper? She is amazing.
=
Their visuals are seriously 'out of this world', YooA looks like a fierce goddess here ...just unreal! So happy for the girls taking the 2nd place and imo even tough Mamamoo won i feel OMG are the true winners of this show! So talented, they have it all, amazing vocals, dance and visuals, oh and the best kind, down to earth personalities you can find! ♥ Stan OMG and become a Miracle!
=
so.... can someone tell me who's her? at 2:21
it's for science
oh btw, i'd like to know who's the girl at 1:48 too... u know... just for science
=
0:50
=
I'm sorry Oh my Girl for only noticing you now huhuhu
=
0:51
=
yooa is so hot in this
=
When you have 4 main vocals.
3 main dancers.
1 great rapper.
And 7 visuals. 
OMG never disappoint
=
wow their voices are incredible and they perform with so much emotion!
=
i hope they release a MV for this epic song 
=
OMG! is THE group, they're all so hardworking and beautiful, their charisma is something wowing, every member has their own scent. I'm so proud
=
They like a goddess especially yooa 
=
They really slayed their performance
=
Seunghee (actually the whole group) SLAYED throughout the entire show fight me if you don’t agree
=
Binnie looks so beautiful I'm SCREAMING!!!!!!!!
=
I’m not saying I’m obsessed with it. But I’m definitely obsessed with this
=
So many feelings in one song. I feel so inspired.
=
Hwaittinggg g oh my girlies!!!
=
I got chills down my spine
=
I'm very happy for them that they improved a lot. They really worked hard and it shows.
=
why all final's songs are so goodTT
=
I had goosebumps the entire video. So good.
=
4:10 OH MY GOD I HAD NO IDEA THAT WAS BINNIE’S HIGH NOTE AND IM SO SHOOK RIGHT NOW
=
They did great job specially the high note
=
maybe queendom is the least problematic show by MNET so far...
=
The struggle of choosing a bias in OMG is real 
=
So proud of my girls ☺
=
To be honest, they deserve to win. They had the best glow up among the groups ✨
=
Please make a mv for this song !!!!!!
=
PERFORMANCE IDLE
MELODY OMG
=
This and Gidle lion at the mama will be everything
=
Such a different concept from their usual image and releases. However, Oh My Girl never cease to amaze how well they can adapt and change (plus add a mystical touch). 
When I watched this, I pictured the members as princesses who are fighting passionately for their world (like an RP game).
=
I thought that mimi and jiho are twins.
=
Even that incredible makeup cannot cover Jiho and Hyojong’s cuteness
Arin looks like a goddess here
Binnie and Seunghee’s high pitch are great
Mimi and Yooa are super cool
=
arrasaram bbs 
=
The song is so good
=
OMG right here serves a four course meal with unli drinks and dessert. Give the 1st place to OMG, MNET you snake.
=
Good,だね。

kou.
=
❤❤❤
=
You deserve the recognitions that youre getting now.
=
3:43 OhMyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
=
Hyojung looks so different at the chorus part when she is smiling and when she is not......  
and Seunghee's walk to the front at the chorus part ooze charm....
Binnie's high notes..wow

great performance. think they have done well in this show. hope they can ride on this and progress further.
=
This is like Binnie Introducing her self as part of the MAIN VOCAL LINE! I can sleep peacefully forever. Been a miracle since debut and had high hopes for Binnie to have decent line and QUEENDOM is serving it for me, for all MIRACLE!
I DONT CARE ANYMORE IF OMG WINS OR NOT AS LONG AS OMG GAIN THE RECOGNITION THEY LONGED AND DESERVED!
=
SNAPPED.
=
I’ve watched this stages waaay too many times and I’m still obsessed with everything about it. Thank you queendom for giving my girls this opportunity to show the world their artistry and how much effort they put into their performances. We definitely need a stage like this for end year awards shows.
=
Guerilla behind the scenes. 
"What kind of concept should we go with?"
"Oh my girl, the concept of this song is oh my girl."
=
lets make petition all of group that joins queendoom will perform at mama 2019!
=
Hyojung is my favorite. She is so beautiful. Her voice is good, too.
=
I am so proud of them 
=
Their vocals make me cry
=
this performance ;___; oh my girl never disappoints
=
SEUNGHEE SLAYED THIS PERFORMANCE OMG
=
The vocals and charisma gave justice. Gosh. So much potential for this group!!!
=
Omooo this stage is lit! OMG is art!
=
Im so proud of them. Been with them ever since & this stage really show their growth over the years. Confidence & potentiality are displayed very well.
=
I could see winx on theem AaAAAaa yooa is on 
=
Hyojung's vocal really shine through this song!!! 
=
OMG THE *RANGE* KILLED ME..
=
So proud for oh my girl 
They all are queen 
=
永远都爱OMG的米拉克
=
THEY ON UNIQUE CONCEPT OMGGG THEY SNAPPED AND LOVE THEIR OUTFITS
=
這歌真的太好聽了
當專輯主打歌都不為過希望
下次回歸可以放進去
=
wow the vocal line
=
I like OMG song & stage. But why?, I feel like 'Guerilla' nearly become song of duo or trio vocals though the most of song. 'Guerilla' is a nice & great song, but I hope for the next song will have better line distribution. And they are really beauty & cute with the great vocals team. I'm fall in love them while 2nd stage.
=
I'm BLINK but i want to join MIRACLE because of this fairy crush concept
=
I love OMG performances. Looking forward for OMG new album!
=
I'm gay for seunghee. Send help.
=
Cantiknyaa 
=
*visual shock*
=
Im grateful OMG joined this show. Im new fan. Love Oh My Girl
=
BINNIE LOOKS LIKE A FAIRY WITH THAT GODDAMN HAIR ugggH
=
Hands up if you've stanned since cupid era 
=
This song live is such a serve. They really didn't hold back.
=
OH MY GIRL STILL WON IN OUR HEARTS, EVEN THEY DON'T TAKE THE QUEENDOM TITLE ATLEAST THEY ARE NOW CONCEPT QUEENS
=
❤️
=
I never seen a girl group danced in fairy crush concept. HOW UNIQUE
=
Oh My Girl is like 2NE1 LEVEL ON STAGE 
=
Okay sooo I just cried out of no where
=
I didnt even know that omg existed honestly thought rheyre same as lovelyz but no bich they aint. Imma now stanning em. Seunghee caught my attention. It would be helpful ti know their fandom name and any other info
=
their high notes are giving me more goosebumps than any queendom performances did omg
=
i am so addicted to this
=
Queendom: you'll realize which group really has freedom on their music.
=
i love it
=
Yooa: *modern witch*
Jiho: *mermaid*
Arin: *fairy*
Binnie: *princess*
Hyojung: *goddess*
Seunghee: *genie*
Mimi: *elf*
=
Truely, in my eyes oh my girl are the true winners here. They started of from being the least well known group out of all 6 groups but their popularity has grown the most out of all the groups and they have improved incredibly. Not only that but they were the most insecure group and as Hyojung said through queendom they stared of feeling as if they were nobody but now their confidence has grown massively and relise that they are loved.OH MY GIRL ARE MY TRUE WINNERS
=
Go Won must be happy to see her queens performing this masterpiece
=
they started with ribbons and ended up with ropes.. Oh My Girl stronger than ever!
=
I love how this show helped people appreciate other groups and it was a friendly competition instead of being a brutal one with alot of fan wars
=
oh my girl is a complete group. they have amazing singers, dancers, rapper, and visual. hyojung, seunghee and binnie shines so much here. their vocals were amazing! also, our center yooa is incredibly in her zone! totally slayed the performance. don't forget our underrated rapper!mimi, her rap flow was so good and nice to listen. jiho and arin's stage presences were also so strong in this performance. they're so beautiful and captivating! God- I love ohmygirl so much 
=
Yooa is so pretty. I couldn’t tell it was her. Love the song btw. Those high notes are crazy good. ❤️
=
Their vocals are so amazing. How could I have been sleeping on them until now? 
=
This feels like an ost in an anime, arin so pretty ♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
1:46　2:03　2:51　3:07　3:43　3:53
I think SeungHee showed her charm in this song.
=
OMG i'll be stand them from now on, i love their girl crush concept in this perform
=
Hyojung with that dress and OMG in that skinny . Its allready finish :)
=
The two main voals of OMG need a sub unit duo debut - they're so powerful
=
I LOVE THEM!
=
I really love Yooa's live vocals... Like, wow.
=
The best concept and costume of oh my girl!!!!
=
As a long time miracle, this stage makes me so emotional. They found their light and determination through queendom and are here to prove that they never hold back. Humble and beautiful until the end these girls deserve everything,, congratulations to all of the groups and park bom for showcasing such great stages and talent on queendom 
=
ARIN IS SO BEAUTIFUL OMGGG MY TWIN
=
The song is really something! The lyrics hits me deepppppp!!!!! Good job OMG <3
=
Song, make up, hairstyle, dance, dress all on point. PURFFFEEECCTTTT
=
QUEENDOM is a celebration of K-pop girl groups!! I think everyone won in this show. I'm glad that these hardworking and talented  girls are getting more recognition in the K-pop industry is mainly dominated by boygroups. They are the ones who faced criticism and get bashed the most. Please be kind and be more supportive towards girlgroups. I think they deserved the attention and love as much as K-pop boys!!!
=
This is incredible! I know of YooA for being an amazing dancer, and Seunghee for not only being friends with Jimin and V, but also for being an incredible vocalist, but never really got hooked by an Oh My Girl song. Well, that all just changed! This was such a great performance.
=
I here watch this masterpiece again and again
=
I got chilled for Seunghee parts
=
They all so beautiful and talented,
=
They are perfect
=
BINNIE'S VOCALS!!!! binnie and seunghee really served us
=
I watched Queendom for Mamamoo and super happy for their win and love their supportive nature for other idol groups, but cannot deny how extraordinary, ethereal, and beautiful Oh My Girl is ✨
=
Binnie slayed the high note!!!
=
THEY REALLY SHINE! GREAT VOCAL! GREAT VISUAL! GREAT DANCE!
=
Honestly, I didn't even bother clicking on their MVs until I saw Queendom. I totally regret not discovering them sooner! They totally slayed my whole life with this performance, Hyojung killed me with her expressions, Mimi with her growing visuals and Binnie with that holy high note near the end.
Congrats OMG, you got a new fan!
=
It’s great to see Oh My Girl be recognised after so long they were under appreciated for so long. They always present a new musical performance for each comeback. 
They’ve always been consistent with their wide range of title tracks. 
From Cupid to Closer. 
Windy day to Liar Liar. 
Colouring book to Secret Garden. 
Remember me to the Fifth Season.
Every title track deserves love  
Their queendom stages are more musically in line with their B sides like twilight which  could also be title tracks. Oh my girl album spectrum reminds of red velvets and f(x) B sides. Songs such as knock knock, perfect day, echo, shower are the reason I look forward to oh my girl comebacks.
Mnet needs to have them perform this at the MAMA awards.
=
Thats right fuckkng awesome
=
thats insaneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE THESE GIRLSSSSSSSSS
=
Esse conceito super combinou com elas 
=
Daebak my girl!!!
=
Oh My Girl is seriously a dark horse of the show, since the beginning no one expecting them to perform this good yet they won first place 2 out of 4 and placed second in the final round. Congrats girls <3 to me, they went from the least to the most fav group, new stan OMG here :3 The final outfits are somehow out-fit to me and Seunghee walk is full of confident and fierceness awwwww <3
=
who's watching it more than twice already like me?
=
This song makes me feel like I can ace my exams, succeed in life and can even conquer the world. Yeah, oh my girl did that.
=
Mature concept, fresh sound, serving visuals and those power vocals damn
=
BINNIE HIGH NOTE OMGOSHDKDHSKSHSJSJSJSSJ I CANTTTTTTTTTTT 
=
Oh My Girl trending everywhere guys....they keep growing every second after this show...4 years they waiting to make people know them
=
can wm give us an MV heheh
=
I never had any high hopes for them being in this show. I went as far as against them participating. Now I feel guilty for not believing them at first... 
Look at how far they've got :") Although the winner is Mamamoo, I feel like Oh My Girl benefited the most from this show. Thank you Msnake for Queendom. And thank you WM for letting our girls participate in this show!  i will keep believing them in the future!! Let's keep winning girls ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
Each of them has so much talent, and beautiful too
=
3M
=
This song’s lyrics are so fitting. It shows OMG’s effort and determination to win
=
Lo mejor que he visto en 2019!!...
=
I didn't know Oh my girl had these vocals
=
*I decided to watch Queendom for AOA and Bom but now become an OMG fan*
=
Seeing people from other fandoms giving ohmygirl a chance now and praising them warms my heart. MIRACLE FIGHTING
=
Holy shet Seunghee frickin slayed
=
Hyojung really is beautiful.. she looks like a princess
=
Somehow relieved that OMG got 2nd place on Queendom, can't imagine the hates if they won.
This is the best achievement for them in the competition, and i hope OMG will have a flower path from now.
Now i can't wait for their real comeback, and wishing that they will sweep all music shows trophy!
Oh My Oh My Oh My Girl!
We are Mira Mira Miracle will always support you.
Stay humble uri OMG, that's your strength 
=
Goals for OMG next year: MORE MUSIC SHOW TROPHY
=
Ohmygirl is so underrated but im so glad my girls are getting more recognition. Please stan ohmygirl you wont regret!!!
=
Queendom was quite a ride for me since I stan four of these groups and know the others.
OMG was the biggest winner as they blew me away.
AOA gave me hope that they can still can be AOA and then some.
Lovelyz have come along ways since debut.
Park Bom I don't understand why they pitted her against groups.  Her singing is solid, but  she can't dance or perform much which limits her and isn't fair.
G-IDLE I was hoping to get to know better after liking their first three songs.  I liked the Nightmare song, but I never connected with them and found the blonde annoying.
MAMAMOO started off hot and playful, but the last two performances were underwhelming.  It was almost like they were bored.
=
Queendom this show reminds me of old kpop when groups would interact in shows. I think that’s the reason why fan wars weren’t so big
=
I think its finally time for me to stan a girl group... Edit: I'm back after an hour and so glad I can now put names on their faces ♡
=
OH MY GIRL ARE RELLY OMG LABDLAJDA♡
=
Not enough Arin screentime 
=
This is like my 200th time watching it all the girls look so gorgeous and YooA she’s just so wow slaying
=
This song is amazing and the concept fits them so well
=
Wowwww THEY IMPROVED SO MUCH! I’m impressed
=
They are so beautifulllllllll ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Why they're so beautiful, their look their voice everything 
=
They all came through with the vocals and rap i’m emo
=
STOP  SLEEPING  ON  OH  MY  GIRL 
=
I might just make OMG my ult girl group
=
Wow, that was awesome. Oh my Girl always amazes me with their choreographies and performances. These girls are absolutely amazing. I don't get it why they are so underrated.
=
I really love every single song Ohmygirl release or cover, they are so talented and they deserve all the love and support❤️ i've been their fan since closer era and i'm so proud of them going this far
=
Anjos ❤️
=
I hope they will perform this song in future, really nice song and good arrangement
=
Once you became a Miracle, you'll always be  a Miracle. ❤
Just like what Binnie said. "There's no turning back, you can get out now."
=
MELHOR PERFORMANCE DO QUEENDOM!!!!!! MARAVILHOSAS!
=
YooA is so pretty
=
this moved me to tears, they are so good!
=
Queendom really made me want to stan OMG.. YooA especially in this performance is just ;;
=
they are underestimated
=
I was expecting more for this stage
=
oh my girl has been in the top 3 for every round and if people still sleep on them, i’m gonna throw some hands 
=
The Vocals are on point BTW Love the Girl Crush Concept 
=
so happy i caught on to this show. i’ve grown a liking to every group who competed. at first i just watched because i knew mamamoo was going to be on the show. but oh my girl and all of the other girls proved that their talent deserves to be seen by the whole world
=
I think Im in love
=
Yooa reminds me of Dove Cameron
=
Tbh, Oh my girl surprised me the most in Queendom.  I didn't know they were so talented ♥️
=
Ang galing po. <3
=
I love the girl
With the tutu makeup!!! She looks so different.
This performance looks like a performance for mama
=
me: seunghee's so cute
seunghee: *performs guerilla*
me: YOU'RE STILL SO CUTE. SO SO CUTE 
=
BINNIE HIGH NOTE OMG
=
They looked so into this perfomance i love it
=
TIME TO STAN WM ENTERTAINMENT NON FANS❤B1A4, OH MY GIRL, ONF, CHAEYEON
=
I always hear Do it Do it as dui dui
=
HOW OH MY GIRL DIDN'T WIN THIS?????
=
1:08 what's her name? Her voice is so good
=
I love every stages in Queendom. This program showed many unbelievable stages for me.
=
YooA...  I have no words.. 
Is she even real?? This beauty is surreal.
=
Wow 
=
Cuantos Fans Latinos de Oh My Girl? 

=
Oh My Girl is Queendom. They might have come 2nd in this final episode but they're the group that have shown different ad improved imaged each stage. OMG represents Queendom.
=
FINALLY BINNIE DID A HIGH NOTE  WHOS ENYONE ELSE GOT SHOCK LIKE ME 
=
And Binnie is still only "Vocalist"
=
I feel like OMG was the group that benefited the most from Queendom. They had a decent Korean fanbase before the show but Queendom really allowed the general kpop community see their skill.
=
this is art
=
the fire in their eyes told us how much they wanted to win! that made the performance even more epic. Oh my girl are winners in our hearts! <3
=
I've been pleasantly surprised by OMG in this show, I've never been a fan of cute girl groups but they've proven me they can put up awesome performances.
=
This should be 'SOTY' Stage Of The Year Also, I don't care they are winning or not because they already win in my heart and also (I believe) the audience/viewers' hearts 
=
If Oh My Girl don't get more popular after this Queendom then kpop has a problem.
=
Just so proud of my girls ah  everything about this stage - song, outfit, hyojung's beautiful smile, EVERY LITTLE THING - I ove love loveeeeeeeeee!
=
THIS SONG IS BEAUTIFUL ❤
=
Who knows that OMG are my first pick even though never stans them before lmao.. this concept are really great and please let them have this kind of comeback more.. btw MimJyo are baes❤
=
for 2 hours, i watched this like 100 times already . i keep played this video. im so 
=
This was soooo goood ❤❤❤
=
The facts that OMG slays in every episode are so great.. goodluck OMG in future. This concept are really suits you girls
=
i'm a BANA and actually if you are one, it's compulsory to stan all WM artists. i just wanna say since Cupid, i ve been waiting for this shot. Gfriend had their time and finally OhMyGirl now.  thank you for appreciating OMG 
=
Am I a little sad that Oh My Girl didn’t win? Yes. But am I surprised that Mamamoo won? No, because mmm is talented and they’re a much bigger group. What I am surprised at is that Oh My Girl came in 2nd. SECOND!! Our girls, who come from a small company and weren’t known by a lot of ppl, showed their full potential and beautiful performances. They worked so hard, and to get 2nd place is an incredible achievement considering they were one of the smallest groups when they joined the show. Congratulations, our sweet girls~ We Miracles love you!! 
=
Proud miracle? Me. ❤
=
They should be in every season of queendom omg
=
Binnie is beautiful af, a voice of a main vocalist, dances well. Idk I think she’s underrated to the public
=
Its make me remember in 1st round secret garden.
Opening with ribbon
Ending with rope
=
MY Q U E E N S S L A Y I N G A G A I N
=
OMG never disappoints. I love you girls! ❣️
=
I can get over how absolutely stunning yooa is. Serious girl crush omg.
=
proud of you 
=
Oh My Girl 
=
Seunghee expressions on point
=
Im am so proud of them with queendom they proved what are they capable of and gain lots of respect and love from viewers , the future will be even brighter for Oh My Girl -  Growing one step at a time <3
=
My most favorite song out of Queendom was Egotistic redone by AOA, but my overall favorite group is Oh My Girl. I look forward to both of their comebacks. New fan.
=
proud miracle here ilysm
=
Loved how they shone as a group in the final Queendom stage. No fancy stage setup, no overwhelming number of backup dancers, just them doing their best and relaying us their story and the true meaning of the song. It's perfect from beginning to end. I love you Oh My Girl! Attention do it, do it! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I love it
=
I love Mamamoo’s song but this song by OhMyGirl just gave me the chills and was very fitting to Queendom and To Oh My Girl’s disposition throughout the competition.. their performance you can feel their eagerness and passion to win it and finally get the recognition they get. i was rooting for them gidle and mamamoo.. mamamoo deserved it too as they are always good, Gidle are monster rookies indeed but Oh My Girl was a group no one expected. I loved them from Closer and windy day.. but they really prove themselves QUEENS! This song is too full of positivity and determination! Anyway Fighting OhMyGirl! We know how you girls were deserving of the win too. it was such pleasure to see each of their performances oh! And i love their outfits and make up in this! They all look so sexy but sophisticated and classy
=
How is everyone in this group so talented. One of my top favourite on my playlist
=
Okay but YooA with no bangs and cat-eye makeup didn’t have to slay me so hard
=
Oftentimes I just forgot that Binnie started off as a sub vocalist...
=
Everyone looks so gorgeous specially Hyojung and Yooa !!! i really love this song  even before they performed it live, the choreo's on point, the vocal everything wss superb !! FIGHTING OHMYGIRL !!
=
I'm not part of their fandom but oh my girl make me immersed in their performance. While other group didn't
=
They all beautiful but Arin SO PRETTY I CAN'T
=
THEY ARE SO PRETTY LIKE DROPDEAD PRETTY HELLO 911
=
Stunning!!
=
Oh my girl reminds me of girls generation. They're definitely going to last a long time
=
Yooa 这场的妆容真是天仙下凡
=
1:30
=
seungheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
=
Okay but is no one gonna talk about how perfect their rope choreography is?
=
This comment is dedicated to OMG'S VOCALS I'm dying at how they can sound soulful, cute, and powerful all in one song wow
=
Dark horses of this season
=
Hyojung body us a body goals for me. Not to skinny, healthy sexy
=
This performance is just so emotional. Overcome the waves, plant their flag, and when they do the gesture "found you" at the end, it's like they're finally getting acknowledged, getting "found" by people. I'm so proud of them even though they didn't win
=
When Oh My girl said number 4 is theirs. And I realize that this video is actually 4 minutes and 44 seconds long.
=
Honestly they deserved to win but with the amount of exposure and love this show brought them i'm happy nonetheless
=
This is so iconic, it looks like it came out from a dark fairy tale, can't stop watching it
=
Queendom makes me fall in love with Hyojung 
=
Whoever did Yooas makeup deserves a raise and a free puppy
=
Binnie looks like a female version of Joshua Seventeen. Love both of them.  <3
=
omg THEY DID SO WELL AHHHH <3
=
binnie just wows me everytime, i dont kNow what is bias anymore
=
It's like the best anime opening ever
=
Wow they look so pretty here!
=
They look so beautiful
=
0:59 the beat is so good
=
IMMA CRY IM SO PROUD OF MY GIRLS OMG
=
i've got a goosebump
=
The two main vocals are unreal. They have such strong stable and clear voices. I’m not a fan of the group but I follow because YooA is a jack of all trades and I love her but those two girls always got me shook with their voices they’re heavenly angels
=
3:42 SEUNGHEE STOP, I'M SCREAMING.
=
Remember that manga oh my goddess? This is it.
=
THEY ARE K-POP
=
If (G)I-DLE are queens that fight using strong physical strength in war, Oh My Girl are Goddesses of War that fight using magic and sorcery.
=
Happy 1M Oh My Girl. Proud Miracle here! ❤
=
color me impressed! i've never really liked oh my girl's music, but this performance was spectacular! vocals, visuals, and dancing on point!
=
hyojung 
=
Let us all praise our Seunghee's powerful high note, she nailed it! attention! praise and adore Oh My Girl, do it doit.
=
What the hell! They got like 4 main vocalists in their group. O.o Slay me OhMyGirl! Gotta stan them now. Any recommendations??
=
1:46 Seunghee did not come to play and is coming to snatch our wigs
=
Oh My Girl is the Idol of ols
=
i'm an elvis but OMG really made me cheer for them!
this performance is amazing

the stage
the outfits
the girls
everything's on point here

between OMG and mamamoo... for me OMG is the winner ;)
=
lol. suddenly i just realize there is english caption. now i can listen to the song while enjoying the performance and understanding what a great lyric this song has.
=
They are so pretty ughh I love their styling always
=
My favorite music 
=
What a ride! From those initial down votes, through two stage wins, to ending with a second-place finish against the group with the largest fandom in the competition. Oh My Girl delivered above and beyond what anyone imagined they could,  and I'm so happy and proud of them. 
I hope they can take this momentum and strength into their next comeback; they've been Fairies, Warriors, Vampires, and Pirates, each time owning the concept and delivering with charisma in spades. What awesome theme will they bring us next?
=
Binnie doing the highnote yasssssss , oh my girl didd greattt
=
MNET CAN WE HAVE ALL QUEENDOM GROUP PERFORMING AT MAMA THIS YEAR ?
=
All kill Oh my girl
ลุคนี้กร้าวใจแม่อีกแล้วววววววว
=
We saw the growth of Oh My Girl in Queendom. Win or lose, they already proved that they are talented by winning 2 times in a row thus should not be slept on.
#Queendom
#OhMyGirl
#Miracle
=
They are not called concept queen for nothing, OH MY GIRL is so talented. I smell victory
=
Congratulations for Oh My Girl getting 2nd place  . Actually I'm ok with this result, they showed their another side, they prooved us that they are concept fairies, they have showed us having a girl crush  concept is not the only way to be successful and the most important, their popularity are gaining which is they deserved it long time ago. We, miracle will always love and support our Queens, OH MY GIRL ❤Also congrats to mamamoo who is the winner of Queendom 
=
Lindo!
=
yoooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
=
Apik... Astaga...!!!! 
=
I am forever their fan
=
I’m a full-pledged Neverland but I must admit, I liked OMG even more now because of their performances!
=
i know Mamamoo got 1st place, but think this final song by OMG is better than Mamamoo's final song, tho i know the points total is cumulative.
=
i got goosebumps throughout the vid this performance is AMAZING
=
They are improving a lot .. i mean A Lot !!!
When group Pride at stake they going 200%
I think they just need a chance to show everyone what they got .. 
Big stages, big shows, and more 'big gigs'
=
So sad Arin almost never got screentime 
=
All those highnotes everything is amazing from 0.00 - 4.44 
=
I LOVE it. It makes me idolize them so, so much 
Btw, 3:43, I felt that 
=
All of you here, I strongly recommend you to watch 4K full cam version of this stage. You will not be disappointed.
=
Love This STAGE!!!!!
=
watch queendom for another group but I am seriously surprised by oh my girl. have started listening to more of their songs 
(and lowkey am wishing I had the rapper's voice)
=
This kind of concept for the next comeback pls I love the song and visuals and wardrobes so much
=
SO GOOD QUEENDOM
=
h My Girl
=
Seunghee... I got goosebumps
=
remember when binnie got only one line in CLOSER 
=
Their makeup is flawless!
=
Oh My Girl? More like Oh My *GOD*
=
music wise i like this song more its catchy, performance wise GIDLE is the best maybe bcs of the concept and back up dancers BUT DAMNNN OMG’s vocals thoooooo
=
How on earth all of them sounded so good?
=
Oh my gosh this song is so good and their OUTFITS AND MAKEUP GOD BLESS
=
Queendom : how much do it did you guys want in this song
Oh my girl : yesss!!
Queendom : and how much  did u want highnotes in this song
Oh my girl : yesss!!!
=
I like yooa's make up for this one. She looks stunning 
=
deng !!! very good .. also suits to be the latest anime ost.
=
I loved how OH MY GIRL didnt utilize much of the back up dancers and other props and focused on their powerful singing and dancing just like how a "comeback" is supposed to be. The message of the song really reflected on their performance. LET'S GET THAT CROWN! ATTENTION DO IT DO IT!
=
Since i realized that someone who's doing that high note was binnie, i can't stop playing this video 
=
OMG is one of that groups who doesn't need to change their original concept. They can just spice it up, or try something new but giving off the same OMG feels.
=
I'm so happy about OH MY GIRL achievement lately. They get so many love call from brand such as cosmetic, cf, magazine and etc. I know and I stan them since cupid era, that time I was stan of their sunbaenim B1A4.. (when the first time i heard the song i know that their vocals and dance so amazing)
Not many people like them in the beginning..
People sleep on their talent...
And now, people finally wake up..
They realize that OMG is so talented..
From now on lets walk on flower path, OH MY GIRL
=
damn Yooa is in different level of beauty
