1:31 Sujin looks steamed
=
It feels like Ancholo after a sexy concept song at a college festival. I feel like I'm not wearing clothes right at the festival
=
I keep sneezing out of my jacket.
=
Give Oh My Girl a reaction at the end of the year ...
=
01:26 Ghana chocolate comes out legend
=
The subject is inferior ..
=
Did one or two people feel something strange when they prepared?
=
2:47 Seolhyun looks like this every time he sees Lovelyz on stage.
=
2:13 I'm coming to see you all the time ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Embarrassed expression ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:03 2:03 2:03 2:03
2:03 2:03 2:03
Hey, it's like a martial arts kawasu reaction, why didn't you see it?
=
It feels like chocolate in the gimbap
=
If you were going to do it like that ... not Achu but powerful! I should have done it.
=
2:03 dance break wow
2:13 Oh my ..
2:47 You're hitting a goal.
=
3:16 c.
There is no soul ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㄹㅇ My heart
=
0:57 Embarrassing
1:03 pupil earthquake
1:20 I think I should do something
1:31 Something strange, but excited
2:02 Reaction Queen Seunghee
2:03 Soulless dance break
2:14 What is it?
2:19 Reverse is reverse.
2:46 That ridiculous smile
3:06 Same facial expressions as before
3:15 I think I should do anything 2
3:57 How much could you praise me?
=
It's something pretty, but did Achura have to wear a sexy concept on her black clothes? Is it an image transformation? It just feels like a sneezing hemp king
=
The freshness and excitement of the first love is melted, but suddenly the first love she threw off her clothes and made an impression on me
=
3:55 If I didn't say how much I would say pollen
=
1:03-Awkward Shuhwa's expression = My expression
1:21-What's just ... ㅡ ㅡ your expression = my expression
1:31-Su Jin's look seriously = My expression
2:02-Baby face no reaction = My expression
=
I don't want to talk about it, so I'm curious what stage will come out
=
It's a success if you're aiming at it.
The song is youthful but why is your clothes sexy?
If you don't think they'll catch anything, just do one. No arrangement, no choreography.
If your head is bad ... you're sick ...
I have a lot to say, but I won't.
=
Oh, the more I look at you, the more I feel sorry for you.
No, I honestly have a few years of idol
8 people gathered, Achu and sexy concept
Who knows if it's right or not.
This is just like a machine
Sing to sing and dance
I think I was working without thinking
I'm really sorry for that.
=
0:48 Seunghee's face is definitely sexy but I was embarrassed when I came to Aku.
=
Lovelyz just keeps up with the concept they used to Why do you keep sticking to the sexy and girl crush and ruining the stage? If you're looking for a concert or looking for something sexy or confronting Queendom, you're better off doing what you want to do.
=
This is more serious than Six Sense ㅠㅠㅠ Six Senses just don't feel good and run like this It's really a terrible hybrid
=
3:50 Finger node
=
Yangsan-style dance team came to support the high school festival. I'd rather be good at interpreting the songs ... If I pushed out the original concept, I didn't swear at least.
=
4:16 ㅋ ㅋ Look at K-Lee Lee The gap between team members shouldn't be too big.
=
I thought it would work if you wear it sexy and sexy.
=
The clothes and the atmosphere are serious, but what if you laugh and sing?
=
1. Kay's fluttering gestures
2. The expressionless expression of maintenance
3. Sweep the head of America
4. Myeongeun Yi's Infinite Mouth Tail
5. Yuna's Mother
It's a song with five points.
I acknowledge the stage.
=
Uh huh ... Total Poor .. It's worse than Six Sense. K That person is like Six Sense and here and why is it because I can't wink and touch the sky .. ㅠㅠ
=
I'll try the arrangement well.
=
This is emoji ..... ㅋㅋㅋ Rhythm version is wrong in karaoke, ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Yuji doesn't do any lip-syncing.
=
I want to be sexy .. I want to be innocent ... What should I say?
=
2:47 Seolhyun Here and in Sixth Sense, I'm laughing without a soul.
=
1:15 I don't have anything to say ... blah blah blah blah blah
=
It's good that Ao is good as it looks. I think the other group was as offended as possible.
There's no words in Eo, but I can see what you're talking about
=
I like the comments because they are so correct.
In particular, America's heading to that expression with that lyrics ... What the hell ...
=
If you're going to be sexy, it's like flying with only the Americas, elites, and Ryu Soo-jeong.
=
How did Yu Jiae get chosen?
=
I don't have anything to respond to the pollen !! I'm doing this ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:03 and 3:06 Editing ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Mnet I made a reaction ... Now I can't call it Amnet.
=
I feel worse than I did.
=
Who's done the trial arrangement again? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I think the original concept wants to change, but because there are not a lot of hits, it's like the result that comes out so it hurts a little ㅠㅠ
=
I'm rolling sexy in the Danube, but the melody is Achu! ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
This is worse than Six Sense Why are you doing this?
=
Outstanding groups and complimentary groups are as good as their own colors and interpretive powers.
=
I know why they can't go to group 1 even though they have pretty girls.
=
They're a little uncomfortable.
=
Why do two of you guys like Yoo Ji-ae read a song like that? It's been a few years, but I don't practice it.
=
Lovelyz's biggest mistake is coming out of Queendom.
=
No. The most serious thing is k ..
Winks all the time.
=
3:56 I think I'm trying to find something good.
=
I'm trying to say something good in the waiting room of the other singers ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:44 Kiwi Songchangha
2:57 Brandnew Hong Sung-joon
Sorry for the inconvenience ...
But it's really reverse ... It's cool
=
2:13 Yuna's look haha ​​I feel like this
=
At school, my friend told me it was ridiculous and I played it on TV, but all my classmates popped up. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's just Achu who just changed her costume
=
I'm just so pretty, but the title starts with a black suit to change the song.
I feel like I'm shaking and wearing it
I think it would have gone to the middle even if I just went to the song and their cups
=
The look is refreshing, why the jacket is taken off ㅋ ㄲ ㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄲ ㅋ ㄱㅋ
=
Thinking about it right now, it's funny that all the children of the Shaman concept in black before this stage are just before, and the next stage is short.
=
Almost the only group of swearing groups in Queen ...
=
At this time, the other groups' facial expressions are real without any presumption.
=
Queendom BlackArch ...
=
2:13 sec Ooh! Lol lol
=
The costume is the clean and chic dance atmosphere of a city girl. The song is just popping and the background is really floating with fruits and candy. This is a real hybrid. Who changed this?
=
2:13 I'm cute.
=
I'm really curious, but what is your position?
=
Debut in 2014 ... Can't Interpret His Song
Mature and sexy are different things.
Actually, when we call 'Bear Girl Six Sense', it's like Lovelyz.
=
2:13 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Why are you taking off your jacket? LOL Don't pretend to be fatal to a song like this.
=
I'm curious about the Six Senses, so I came back to the drums and I'm so thankful that my idols are children and Jeon So-yeon.
=
Kay is like a trot singer
=
I don't listen to songs and only watch videos. Isn't the dance the same as the original song? Danube in the middle? without????? What ... What did you do to the contest ???
=
I really like Hyojeong's reaction to each stage .. ㅠㅠ
=
If you're going to be sexy, I'll give you a wink + love gesture ... I don't know why you're not fit for the concept ...
=
This was before Six Senses ... Ah .......
=
I didn't know anything strange with so many people before the stage ...?
=
Ha ... I thought Six Senses was the best, but I came in wrong ... Hybrid ...
=
I'd like to do something good for the song lyrics, but I think the costume will spill over;
=
It's been a while since I've come in again but it's always the same
=
Even if you bring 100 concepts, it feels like one
=
No, all of the other singers' reactions are responsible for the Korean language ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:13 Same as my face.
=
This is not an artist who wants to play music, but an idol that the company made to make money ...
=
And sincere agency, Infinite Rocket Punch Golden Child.
=
2:13 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Achuev
Why do you put in lake dance?
=
Ah, everything else is fine, but K's face
=
It seems like I can't interpret the song too much.
=
I saw this group for the first time with a sexy concept like this.
=
I already give my lips a bit of lip sync and lip sync
=
I can't .. I've been looking for all these guys because they're funny. I need to cleanse them up.
=
I'm not sexy at all. Why don't you tell me why?
=
Sujin is the biggest smile
=
???: Imagine being just a sexy queen lol
There's no reason .. Just call Achu!
=
Do not criticize but criticize. Even if it's innocent and funny, it's bad
=
Wear clothes roughly sexy and sing a song the same way
=
Even on this stage, I'm laughing and I'm standing on the stage like this lovely, lovely smile
Let's say that ...
=
Kay is not sexy. The room is smiling. ㅋㅋㅋ You just need to call K-Tot once.
=
What is this ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Reward other groups ... Everybody's reaction is not a joke?
=
Please stop galk. Why do you think it's lovely?
=
They're hits, but no matter how inverting, do you have to take the concept? What's the sound of bluffing?
I don't know everything, but Ryu Soo Jung is pretty ~
=
I only listened to the real song and didn't why. But I learned how to play with Queendom. Really ... What's going on with the song interpretation?
=
I know why Lovelyz is below other competitors.
=
2:03 What's the reaction like Munhwa Solar Hangshow Hawasoo?
=
I'd rather wear Shabangbang and dance like Shabang, and it would have been better if I danced Shabok. And the clothes are the same.
=
What's the use of lip syncing contests?
=
While doing this stage ... I said 98% chance of winning, it's true.
=
The group that doesn't really fit into the real Queendom lineup ... why can't you be so diverse?
=
I don't even understand their songs.
=
Interpret what it means
=
It's cold and I sneeze, but why don't you take off your jacket?
=
2:13 Oh, that's Moya?
=
What is this...
I watched it with ° __ °
=
How old are you?
=
ㅋㅋ ㄱㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㄲ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Personally, I was more angry when I saw Black Art than Six Sense ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅠㅠ
=
2:14 This is the challenge of 1,000 pieces of music.
=
3:50 I find it especially difficult for these fingers
=
2:44 What is handsome
=
This one
=
I need to mute it and not watch the lyrics.
=
3:16 I'm sad but I'm not a fan
It's just because it feels like Mimi's arms are looking sexy.
=
It's unconditionally girly or sexy.
=
2:14 Oh my .. (Why are you?)
=
It's a stage that makes me lose. I loved the song so much that I could get more songs when I got the Lovelyz song, but I'm really disappointed. It is the board to learn by watching the direction. I thought it would be a good opportunity for this ambiguous group to come out of this program, but the stage was really disappointing. I don't know if I'm embarrassed when I see other group stages. I don't know what I'm trying to show.
=
0:33 Kay's expression is really ...
=
The most important thing when setting the stage concept is the contents of the song.
Wearing a sexy costume on black to break the bright and cute image
What's the difference between putting in the most famous song?
Wearing tight clothes, rolling over the floor and singing the crush of unrequited love ??
=
1:19 Arin's expression = my expression
1:31 Sujin's expression
2:14 Yuna expression = my expression
2:47 Seolhyun's expression
=
Maybe I want to be sexy. I want to do Achu but I just put them together but I just changed clothes in Achu ..?
=
2:13 Ohm Catastrophe
=
I'm curious what AO saw on this stage.
=
2:13
Roughly why
=
Achu Achu sneeze and take off your jacket
=
2:47 Seolhyun's look at the Lovelyz contest wasn't the face of Oh My Girl from the secret garden stage !! I think some of you might have seen Achu contest in the comments.
=
2:38 From here, I decided to take off my clothes and suddenly decide because it was hot.
=
Isn't Mnet told you? It's the worst out of the program
=
But if Achu is a sexy version, shouldn't she wink or cute? Seriously what are you doing? 대로 I do it the original style ... Honestly, I think the original song is better .. Only me ... They look good. Why not?
=
Black Underline
Hey hey hey!
They think they are
Others laugh at me
=
If you want to be a girl crush or a sexy concept, you have to change the lyrics and change the lyrics as well.
=
1:19 Arin's face looks like a grumpy face by a person who doesn't like baby.
=
1:31 Sujin Oh ㅠㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Oh it was so funny ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
02:19 Reverse without reverse
=
It looks like a Japanese idol .. ㅠㅠ Idol team who is a little good in Japan seems to cover Korean songs.
=
It's just been the answer since Sixth Sense ...
=
It's fun to see the comments. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
1:15 Obaim ..? I don't really know what they want now.
=
At this point, it sounds like we are protesting for our sexy concept
=
The singers don't know how to react ...
=
Now the comments are funny
=
The clothes and the song don't fit so well.
=
1:30 Sujin expression ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The first contest number of views is 1,126 million times, but Lovelyz is 2.44 million times ...
=
Honestly, I think Lovelyz comes out here and ruins the image. Girl Crush Concept The song that I sing is a beautiful song ... Because it is a hit song, I grabbed a concept that suits Achu well.
=
There's a reason it doesn't work ...
=
1:55 No dance break ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ When I was in middle school, I changed to music rewind and suddenly danced
=
진짜 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ No, I can only say this. 'Fool' No. 1 What was the America's expression before the wasabi ..... It's pretty
=
I would rather come out with a edgy choo ㅠㅠㅠ Why do you want to keep sexy, if you want to choose a good song ㅠㅠ Really upset ㅠㅠ
=
ㄹㅇ Before the start of the song, I thought of the early dance and dance breaks and dressed .. I feel like I'm wearing a suit and cotton candy.
=
Reason for watching this video: There are handsome people in the middle
=
2:13 Yuna Oh my god ㅋ ㅋㅋㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
How come they're lip-syncing when they're singing
=
I think it's the worst reaction in the Queendom stage.
=
It's a real image and it's like this. ㄹㅇ No one finds you sexy.
=
Pause after seeing comments
=
I wore a dress that was a little loose, and I sang it, but I didn't arrange it anyway,
=
I'm so fond of them, whether it's because of the agency or the kids. Seolhyun's expression tells everything ... ㅠ
=
It's even more crappy than the '9's dance break. ㅋㅋㅋㄲ ㅋ ㄲ ㄱㄲ ㅋ ㄱㅋ
=
Here's what I named Black Achu. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
If you can't do it, uh?
=
Drip power is the world's No. 1, although Korea doesn't know anything else.
I feel like I'm crying with a smile
=
02:47 Look at Seolhyun expression
=
Even Jisoo's kid sucks up his personal part.
=
1:14 You don't do any lip syncing?
=
2:03 Ah, why do you think this dance dance is so funny ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
In-depth analysis
First of all, the girly atmosphere is not good for the impact on stage. But it seems that Achu chose that song because it was a good song when they were most confident and didn't care about the concept.
=
Ryusujung is better than that
=
02:39 Kids, put on your jacket again ...
=
Whenever I see the stage, I have a common sense that I can't do music analysis. Even if I'm not an expert, I can't understand why it's ruining music by interpreting the atmosphere, lyrics, and so on.
=
3:16
Everyone is sexy ~ ...
Really..
=
2:16 The two of you are cute and handsome.
=
The clothes, the songs, the expressions are all playing separately. They don't even understand song.
=
rather
Power innocence .... Lyrics are pure innocence ... Sexy .... Dogs grief ... What is the feeling of playing separately ...
=
This is the worst gel
=
Kay sings like a moonlight angel, if it's a sexy concept
=
1:30 Sujin expression ㅋㅋ Same as our expression
=
1:36 I see it harder ....
=
No other singers reaction is too soulless
=
I don't have a cute song melody arrangement and just put the middle part and match the atmosphere with the part
It's sexy money.
It doesn't really fit
=
Real catastrophe. It's a catastrophe when I put a sexy love concept into an innocent love song
=
Innocent is much better than apology.
=
1:19 Contributing to her sister
=
I don't work for my company. I don't know much about music. Lovelyz Don't let the image fall but let's go straight.
=
I'm just trying to do what I want to do because I'm out of Queendom. But it's kinda funny. movement..
=
I really appreciate the YouTube algorithm that predicts this response and brings the latata to the related video.
=
2:13 Facial expression
=
What is this really?
=
I wish we could do this now
=
1:56 Achu Dan Brownie
=
I'm so sorry for the sexy concept now .. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Initially, the sexyness doesn't exist.
=
The comments are so funny lol
=
2:14 This is what my mom looked at my report card
=
Ah ~ I think I'll sigh when I look at you ~
=
I think you'll have a stye if you look at it. I love Lovelyz.
=
2:10 Dog laugh 닼 ㅋㅅㅋ ㅅㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Collect all the sexy sexy and sweep the floor Achu!
=
.... So that song is that costume. So that's how you take off that song?
=
No ... No matter how you arrange the arrangement, Achuro never catches up with the concept of sexy ... Absolutely ... Look at the lyrics. Sexy is impossible.
=
2:03 Oh, Mamamu reaction is funny lol.
Dance break ~~!
Wow ~~ !!
=
2:19 Half I. C. Really ~
=
You're a company that works well.
=
How long does it take to be sexy and girly? Affiliates Just like Lovelyz ... Write it as an arrangement and read it as the original song. If you do this, AOA will laugh at you.
=
Baby Soul is not caught by the camera
=
1:11 seconds ..... no ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's bad ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Honbibaeksan Dilemma
=
1:51 What's a gin 'mouth? It's amazing
=
Six Senses can make excuses that the original song was too big
This is no excuse
=
Paap-❤️
=
Why do you look like a lip sync?
=
The background and the song are pink but the costume is black ㅋㅋㅋ Is this the most popular black pink?
Please think about and dress up the kids ...
=
2:13 This expression contains all the endings of this video.
=
These guys are gag ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:46 Funny ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Ah, when you comment
=
It's worse than six senses
=
2:03 Mamamu and SoulX. LOL
=
Why aren't there any surges at this time?
=
2:03 Wow ~ Dan, ha ... I feel like this (Jessica)
=
No comments Are you laughing and have a pain in your bones? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:38 anti-horsepower test
=
3:08 My mouth is weird
=
Something like a nightcore version on YouTube
=
Modifications are so dry ....
=
It's a song, but you're wearing all-black chains and boots? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This song is also difficult to arrange dark, but because of the lyrics ;; What are you guys doing?
=
ㅠ ..... what should I really do ............
=
Where is the index part? ㅠㅠ
=
Wow, people are so funny. I still want to close this video and the Saxony video. You guys are funny
=
Because of this, his career is similar, but his group + understanding of his songs is clearly different.
=
Even if I'm not an entertainer, I'd know without knowing that it's not such a costume in Achu. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ What did you think of other singers?
=
Yuna look lol
Oh my god, what's that face?
=
What do you call accessories from the neck to the waist that Lovelyz sisters are wearing in the video?
=
3:56 Pollen Pollen
=
2:46 Seolhyun's face looks so cool. Lol.lol.lol.lol.lol ... lol blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
=
2:13 Oh haha!
=
Ah, you guys ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
If you make a sound, it's just a sound
=
2:56 Hong Seong-joon ...
=
I've seen this now and it's funny ㅁㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
What is Achu in black? Arrangement Who did it?
=
Song: Refreshing
Concept: dark
Backstage Background: Rainbow
Choreography: Sexy
Special Effects: Pollen
Fresh + Dark + Rainbow + Sexy + Pollen = ??
=
I tried to do something different .. but it really doesn't go well, just the song doesn't go well with the clothes or the stage.
=
2:44 Existence
=
1:20 Oh my God ... Oh my god.
=
This is Hyojung coming to see her (^ ♥ ️ ^) ~ Oh
=
But every time I see Jean, I wonder why
=
2:14 What are you doing?
=
Are you trying to get fucked?
Why are you doing that?
=
It's not just clothes.
=
It really doesn't suit
=
2:02 When it's a beer. Wow ~! Why are you laughing here?
=
1:26 Are you a "church"?
=
If it was possible to arrange Achuro Girl Crush in the first place, would the arranger have already become a world-class musician?
=
1:31 Cute Minnie
=
Is this from your agency or is it Lovelyz's own?
=
It feels like eating with a fork and a knife in a suit at a soup restaurant
=
This is a problem. The song is awesome, but it's ruined. ㅋㅋ But it all looks so diverse .. It's too recording.
=
2:14 Oh my god. What are you doing?
=
2:14 Omo what is that
=
2:13 Oh my!
=
I'd rather arrange a cappera version, but this is not the arrangement, but what is the arrangement? The dance is strange, the clothes don't play the song, and the Jisoo parts fly through the barrel. ...
=
Why do you keep trying to be sexy? ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I would rather dress cute,
=
No matter how you look at it, why do you choose a lovely song like Achu?
=
No matter how the costumes, arrangements, etc. have combined each other without consulting each other, but I have to figure out how to sing.
=
2:14 Expression: Oh my god
=
Wow .. serious .; They can't digest it. TT TT What are you doing? The kids' union isn't right. It's a separate soup. ㅠㅠ TT TT and Six Sense are the cover songs.
=
What sexy sexy Lovelyz thinks
Sexy = short dress wearing black
Person ...
It's too one-dimensional to say ...
Six Senses had an example of the original song, so I could imitate it.
=
These guys are really ... not too ...
=
2:13 It's not like it's like it's like this
=
Ah ... I'm not good at arranging songs, but I feel like it's unnatural and strange because of different clothes.
=
I'm sorry, but I can't help my life. Who was the stage planner?
Rather, it would have been a plus for them to construct a narrative concept like a recent song.
If you've got Achu, you're good at innocent cuteness or sexy, innocent, or not.
=
1:20 So cute ㅠㅠㅜㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
2:14 LOL
=
3:15 Can you take responsibility for that?
=
No. I don't know why the girl who likes someone's pure and thrilling heart fits into a sexy concept. It's a masterpiece, so even if you don't have the same atmosphere, it's a pity .. It's not black, and it's not intense that it's only frowning, but it's a pity that Lovelyz is so ... The Queendom appearance is the only poisoned group.
=
게 Gee Nam who lacks sincerity
Everyone mentions arrangements and concepts. It's a difference between sexes.
=
Using Achu in this concept
=
Ah, what's it like to keep singing in front of you and catching a sexy pose at the end ...
=
보고 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I watched the video and commented, but all of them have the same heart ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:46 Seolhyun Dog Funny Do it your way .. ㅎㅎ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ like this ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Wow, Seolhyun Reaction It's an original omgirl reaction (I admire it after laughing.) I cut it like that and put it here
=
This is not Achu I knew
=
2:47 * Seolhyun expression * Oh My Girl
It's a secret garden reaction.
I'll make sure and move on !!
=
Oh, I was curious to see the comment mentioned on this stage elsewhere, but I ran asleep ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's amazing that they're the same company as Infinite. The skills can be so different in one company.
=
1:29 This is crazy.
=
Why are you going to be sexy? ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ...?
=
Reactions from other singers come! I feel it
=
Huh ... No. The lyrics are flying, but the clothes are chained to black ... The last ones are also flying at the background. I'm blowing pollen at the end ...
=
If I had to dress like that, I would rather be Destiny, which was a little darker.
=
3:06 And these guys are funny
=
I can't hear Yuji's voice
=
I got it from the arranging company and I got it a day ago. And in Queendom, what's the matter? ;;
=
Hellbaya and Helldudu Yushun algorithms in the next video
=
It's my love, but it's my favorite but it's the clothes and the background and the background.
=
It looks like you're going to sneeze when you see it Why did you take off your jacket?
=
What Lovelyz needed at this time: `` A man who runs against time '' in Haman's strongest biography in Running Man
=
The purity is good, why are you sexy?
=
I think I'm better suited to the color than rocket punch than Lovelyz ...
=
Other idols are responding ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Are you courteous or roughly reacting? Soulless soulless anyway ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
The other place is the real reaction.
=
How hard were the singers out there to react?
TT
=
2:13 (mouth)
=
1:31 Sujin = My expression
=
3:56 Pollen Pollen!
=
I've seen Six Sense, but I can't see it from start to finish
=
Why are you ...
=
I only point to Seung-Hee while pollen pollen ㉯ ㅋㄹ ㄹㅋㅋ
=
1:20 ^ ♡ ^ Oh ~
=
Lovelyz thank you ❤️
=
AOA facial expressions not really funny neck ㄱㄱ ㄱㄱㄱㄱ ㅋ
=
Is it true to play clothes and songs separately? I just wear sexy clothes and sing fresh songs?
=
Seolhyun is like a reaction scene in Oh My Girl Secret Garden. I don't know where I edited it.
=
I wanted to see the concept
=
The song is Achu, but the costume is Miss A. Hershey ... Wye ... Why did you ... Who planned this stage?
=
Laugh ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No it's not that lol. Who's the sexy conception in this song ?; Even if you arrange the song, you shouldn't have arranged it on the board.
=
Are you ashamed of Achu? Don't ruin our Achu.
=
03:20 Yogi is really amazing.
=
How can I think of this concept?
=
It doesn't match the song and the costume. Wear it really lovely ~ (Don't do what you want to do, do what you do well ~
=
If you look at me, it looks like phlegm
=
Only the hair, clothes and the introduction
=
Audiences didn't know all the conclusions, but it wasn't because they were lovely, but it was because they did Achu like that.
=
No. I'll change the chord chords.
=
1:31 I want to talk to you only
=
It's your song, why is this?
=
I just have a group of girls who have pretty feelings lol
=
Oh I feel empathic Shame Why are you so funny? Just cut the image and swear at me ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Some members look awkward and gesture to look sexy in that song.
=
2:26 It looks like a wave
=
This song is more suited to Jung In ....
=
3:56 Ah-choo because of pollen allergy .. I'm sorry.
=
The song is cute, but the stage is dark, the costume is sexy, the makeup is a big sister ... The choreography that I changed in the middle is a total crush .........
=
It's dark chocolate on the outside but it feels like milk chocolate
=
If you were in 6th place, you should watch the video and see what went wrong. I didn't do it, so Siksen was forced to come out like this.
=
No, why are you so cute while holding the concept like that?
=
2:04 It's a soulless reaction.
=
Why are you interpreting this bright light like that? It's too heavy.
=
2:12 = my expression
=
I was looking forward to seeing the thumbnails.
=
I called the amusement park in front of my friends, and I thought it was good, but I realized that my horsepower is not a big deal.
=
2:13 D. My face ... what are you doing ...? feeling
=
Wheein Dance Break! It's funny to do it lol
=
1:31 Serious Sujin next to my excited sister
=
Cute
=
1:15 I don't even lip sync
=
2:47 Seolhyun's face is ...
=
2:13 Expressions show everything
=
This comment is so funny ^^ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:14 His face is ...
=
Now it's my shower song ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I still don't know what they're attracting to you. I think it makes sense to choreograph Achu .... I think you can see why Lovelyz is not the top terrestrial. I can't tell what's best suited to you. Let's stop with your company. Lovelyz is not a newcomer, but a group with some experience. Your opinions will be reflected. Rather, the song was much better when the company managed everything.
=
I'd rather arrange a sexy version.
It's a mess.
Is it sexy if I wear only sexy clothes?
=
Why do you want to be gulled?
=
2:14 Mom, why are you doing that?
=
But in the meantime, the song and the concept don't go together, but some of the guys have their mouths open and they're doing this ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Whenever I'm on the stage of Lovelyz, I'm looking for AOA members' ticket information.
=
2:18 Baked tea
=
Dance break
Wow ~
=
I would rather have been higher than the sixth place
=
Why are you so ...? If all the songs are the same and only sexy clothes and choreography are worn, what are you going to do?
=
Let's assume that Ryu Soo-Jung already has this concept.
The rest is um ... especially Ke and Yuji? I'm sorry, but not really, why do you want to keep Sexy? I'm gonna wink my hand, I'll fly a hand kiss
=
I'm really curious if you think the sexy concept fits in this song lyrics.
=
3:17 You're so sexy.
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm wearing sexy clothes, but I'm dancing sexy, but the music from the back is Achu ~ .. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I've been wondering how I played Six Senses and hit songs, but I put on a cute concept song and put on my facial expressions, dance clothes, and mix them with water and oil. I wore a skirt. I don't want to sing in innocent concept
=
The concept is sexy, Cutie.
=
It's strange to see this and think Six Sense is better.
=
Lol
=
Anytime I see ...
=
Put your clothes on something like Miss A Hershey's dress .. It doesn't go well with the concept of singing.
=
fighting....
=
Achuhong ~ ♡
Pahab ~ ♡ What's the difference ????
=
What the hell is a reversal?
=
1:25 Surprising itself ... Do you think you're going to be sexy when you break dance and put on costumes like that? It's amazing It's more serious than Six Sense Six Sense has a lot of enthusiasts, can't live charisma and can't live pop.
=
2:41 It's my laughter mine to throw off my jacket
=
I came to see Six Sense because it's fresh.
=
03:16 I'm the best senior class ㅋㅋㅋ
=
What's this concept? Lyrics you don't know about me. Hmm, but my clothes and actions are from sexy.
=
I was really curious what other singers thought
Especially Soyeon
Composing Arrangement Producing. I thought it would be better to assess the situation
=
I'd rather have an Achu rock version ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ The costumes are sexy. The song is cabbal ~ ㅡ .. ㅡ ;;
=
No, why are you pretending to be sexy when you speak like a baby ㅋㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I can't see you because of my magical power.
=
This is not Achuga.
=
Nobody really did it until this contest .. ??
=
(Comments about confusion)
=
Oops out the only part that has only one wow ~
=
4:15 Left .....
I was on the web and you were very pretty.
=
But it's a survival contest that comes with teams, but it's ready for this. What have you been trying to do? .... It's changed dance. Isn't it too disappointing?
=
Let's explain and stage the concept in detail.
=
But Achu may go sexy at first but the concept is crushed in ah choo!
=
I'm sitting down, taking my jacket off while I'm about to sneeze
=
1:09 Is it a dragon? Wasn't it a sexy concept?
And the funny thing is the reactions from the other groups
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Really all reactions have souls ... ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Achu with this costume?
I'm not good at analyzing the music.
It's a sexy concept, but the lyrics are 'I'm not good at cooking yet, but I'm practicing'
Not even sexy Not even dozer
With this, Lovelyz becomes a poor image that can't catch the concept.
=
Just do the same as you did ... ㅠ
=
Um ... well let's just go with a cute concept.
=
3:50 Finger Puppy
=
Ah, you're sexy if you just wear the harness and sing it in your own song? ㅌㅌ ㅎㅌ ㅎㅌ ㅎㅎ ㅌㅎ ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
3:56 Seung-hee, I'm talking to you somehow.
=
Why is there no part of Jisu?
=
This is a stage to shine a cameo
=
Even though I didn't try the sexy concept, I didn't try too much.
=
This video Kilpo 2:13 Just my facial expression funny ㅋㅅㅋ ㅅㅋㅅㅋ ㅅㅋㅅㅋ ㅅㅋㅅㅋ ㅅㅋㅅㅋ ㅅㅋㅅㅋ ㅅㅋㅅㅋ ㅅㅋㅅㅋ ㅅㅋㅅㅋ
=
So what do you want to show?
=
2:13 Ena expression = my expression
=
The image has dropped further since Queendom.
I know why not
=
3:14 Are you serious?
=
1:19 Ticket Information
=
Honestly, I'm a debut fan of Lovelyz, but it's not like this, but the outfit doesn't go with the fresh song
=
Even though the song is good, there's a reason why it's ruined.
=
The choreography and costumes are exhausted ~~~~
=
Lovelyz is really pretty as it is
But in Queendom, it's like a wacky boy.
=
All the other contestants have lost their souls.
=
2:20 Su-jin and Mi-yeon's facial expressions are perfect.
=
I wonder if you didn't think about anything while practicing.
=
It's such a lovely lyrics. Why did you think that concept?
=
1:20 I'm afraid of hyojeong expression
=
2:14 Shock, that's his face.
=
Oh I can't see it till the end
=
2:44 with,
=
Isn't this their song?
=
I'm going to go to the intro outfit and go to the new girl concept, but the arrangement is very different from the original song, and I feel cuty lovely. So I feel heterogeneity with the clothes and the sexy expression.
Oh, if I wanted to do sexy concept, I would have been better if I arranged
=
I'm looking at Kakao page.
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Rather than looking at the beginning of the introduction, it would have been fine to mix and arrange all the songs that I had made up to this point.
=
I didn't depreciate but I laughed the most among the videos I watched recently. ㅠㅠㅠ First time watching the stage + Fellow singers' reactions.
=
Crystal said firmly that Achu is not sexy. Who sent it out to Achu sexy version?
=
I can't see you in just 3 seconds.
=
0:08 0:15 I've got a lot of fun here ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Anyway, the intro was so good ..... even the hand cuffs were so good.
=
It's a lovely fan but let's talk calmly
This concept was a complete judgment miss. I can do a girl crush. You didn't reverse the arrangement at all, and you can do girl crush in other songs. This concept in this song is a complete judgment miss
I believe you'll do better in the next contest.
=
I don't know whether it was planned by Lovelyz or who planned it, but it's not always a lovely charisma stage.
=
Jin lips why then ...
=
Why are you doing this?
=
It's a spectacle .... lol.
=
2:02 Cute Toddler
=
I know the best people who have eaten meat aoa has done a lot of sexy concepts, so I know that Lovelyz is the best shovel. The concept of innocence image fits well with the song and the group color is so good.
=
This is not ... ㅠ TT What is that I do not understand their songs;
If I want to be sexy, I would rather sing another song. There is a reason to swear ..
=
1:14 Others are acting chic concepts
1:08 2:42 2:52 K-man is in the middle of a school show, and if you see dancing, you practiced really hard, but the members didn't communicate well.
=
I feel sexy even when I turn off the sound
=
I tried to show the reversal but I think it's a violent stage.
=
I don't know why they won Park Bom
=
I'd rather wear white ... The concept and the outfit don't fit so well ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Song ... Let's take it seriously
=
Just be innocent
=
There's no answer. No dance time.
I'm really laughing. I'm rather Destiny ... If you start dreaming and turn sexy, you're Destiny ... What's the concept in Achu?
=
1:29 Minnie Kim
=
What concept?
=
This is the Goblins in the comments ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Why don't you do this? If you want to do this concept, you can't do it. You don't know what you wanted to do.
=
These guys are getting more and more ...
=
Oh sorry to Lovelyz .. Honestly, Achu is a favorite song. Ograd feels. So I'm only reading comments
=
Why are you here? . .
=
Ronglim told me to use this sexy version
Real ringing ...
=
Personally, it's more hybrid than Six Senses
=
Miss Song ... Miss Costume ... Achu is a cute image.
=
Would this have been the only sexy song?
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ OH MY GIRLS looks very nice at all. It's not sexy at all, but sexy ... and other singers are busy laughing .. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ̄̈ ㅋ ꙼̈ ㅋ ̆̎ ㅋ ̐̈
=
Don't ever be sexy please.
=
Ha .................. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No I don't sing too much. The lip sync is too long
=
I really couldn't ..... I can see the other singers react but I have nothing to say
=
1:14 You don't even have an American lip sync?
=
1:15 Mi-joo's facial expression is true? That music and the words in the lyrics are that expression and eye action. ;; I thought five were drunk people at the same time. Play this too
=
Hyojeong's Ohmo ~~ and Minnie's upper body dance is cute
=
When I see this from other stages of Queendom, I only laugh.
=
Anti-horsepower test .....
=
Seolhyun reaction is not false. If your mouth is closed, you are nervous. If your mouth is open, you are funny 2:46
=
Hong Seong-jun So handsome?
=
Ah haha ​​I'm wearing that dress and dancing
=
It's because Eoe is so fast, I'm sure I'm expressing my expression lining
=
I'd rather send you a rocket punch than goblins.
=
Dan!
Wow...
It's half full.
Coco coke
=
LOL
=
The clothes are crushed, the songs are not innocent, they're not dozers, what's this hybrid?
=
It's their song, can't they be interpreted?
=
I can't compliment you, so I feel like pollen?
=
Please don't let me make a fatal dance
기본 ㄷ ㅂㄷㅂㄷ, but the basics are prettier
=
2:13 facial expression
=
To be honest, Achu is famous for gel. It's a hit song .. But it's a shame that it's a sexy concept.
=
They're really different from clothes and makeup. There's nothing different than a little change from Danbra and Intro. It's their song.
=
Somehow, my friend pretends to be cute
It looks like yachu
=
The beginning of a case
=
2:14 What are you doing?
=
.. something very much mixed ...... a bit marathine feeling ..
=
I've made the arrangement feel a little bit more weird ... I know what I wanted to feel ...
=
If you don't know how to arrange the song and make it feel like AOA Short Skirt, you can't do it. And who knows it's Achu from the ending. "
=
Achu is really sporty, but it's a joke.
=
I fluttered a high school girl's first love song
Underpants, All Black, See-Through, Shaggy Jewelry
Rolling dance from the bottom, jacket
What combination is this, what are you doing?
=
No. The song was sexy and cute. The dance was sexy and cute. What is this?
=
Lovelyz I think I'm just insisting on this sexy girl crush, but I don't understand girl crush itself
=
Mi-joo look good den? There's nothing to see but that
=
It is a nation of real drips
=
I like Lovelyz and I like Achu, but this is a little girl.
=
To arrange the sexy concept with this song, the arrangement is arranged, but the lyrics should be changed.
The lyrics of `` Achu sneezing will come out '' don't look sexy. ;;
=
Queendom is coming out and everything is rising.
Ah, I could fall further
=
무대 The stage becomes silent
=
Was it Yuji? Untidy length pants
3:21 3:21 3:21 3:21
He doesn't have a professional
Too expressionless
=
There's no answer when I'm ringing these days .... I can't follow the trend.
=
When I close my eyes
Okay
=
It seems like the back dancers are practicing rehearsals because of all the clothes. ,, ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ
=
2:14 What are you doing?
=
What do you do when you make a sultry expression?
=
Not even a serious dozer ;;; Even other singers seem ambiguous to react
=
To attract attention to my boyfriend
I changed my clothes style, but it doesn't look good
Does this feel like it?
=
If you're going to do this, you're not going to play Destiny like a ballad, but change the rhythm so I'll wait for you like this. Going like this ...
=
Yeah, I don't think so
=
The echoing ...
=
I think it's too much of a changed image because of the Queendom.
It was a pity that I felt awkward because of the concept and the original lyrics
=
Does this look like you're sneezing?
=
Really ... twice in a row.
=
Like a deodorant ad ...
=
What do you want to do with these guys ???
=
It's a Lovelyz fan, but this stage could be the 6th place. Other groups don't have much response, and there's something less than other group competition stage
=
How to get sexy with Achu. How to get girly with Achu.
=
This is more serious than Six Senses
=
I'm singing ballads in karaoke, but the video shows the feeling of Norazo.
=
Well, it wasn't a problem, but ... Fans have a problem with curved tacks.
=
S: S: S: S: S
Really.
(Why not do this anymore Sexy concept?)
=
Reaction Atchubra
=
Why are they trying to be sexy
=
This is worse than Six Sense ??
=
Egg ~ Amnet, get some work.
Are you swearing at me?
=
Is this your song?
=
I think it would have been better if you didn't like this song, but it would be better
=
No, call Achu and roll the ground?
Is it true?
=
Wouldn't it be better if we had to be authentic and innocent?
=
Really ... just ... what is this ... ??
=
I thought you were wrong at first
=
I was so addicted to see you all the time.
=
Surrogate shame is coming ...
=
Great stage stage ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
1:09 3:50 As well as Six Senses, Kay doesn't have the ability to interpret songs and concepts. Other members pretend to be sexy.
2:10 Atsugi is dancing sexy while rolling on stage!
4:10 Sexy posing in the ending world innocent accompaniment
=
No it's a remake ;;; I just wrote a karaoke version .... ,,, ;;
=
If you're going to do the original song, don't you dress it up ...
=
1:42 Behind the scenes, everything tells me, I put everything in, and eventually everything spills and smudges.
=
The case that I missed trying to catch two rabbits
=
I want to change my image to sexy, but my career has never been so sexy no matter how I arrange it.
=
Pretend to be fatal after the stage.
=
Oh it's not just me.
=
The general public knows that it's not a sexy feeling.
=
I'm so sorry. I don't have a chance.
Everyone else doesn't know how to react.
I am really ambiguous and the song and voice go well together
At the same time, the costume and back background are b;
Besides, understanding songs, acquiring expressions, acting, etc.
Too short There's no real hope
=
2:19 I'm so funny about this. I'm half ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:14 hahahahahaha
=
Not to say
=
I didn't see Achu, but I didn't see you today.
=
Lovelyz won't work; You can't even work for your own company.
=
What a horrible thing to do with that clothes
=
1:12 I don't sing and pretend to be sexy.
=
What the hell is this concept? innocence? Sexy? ??????
=
It's a nice video without thinking
=
The original song is exciting and it feels like cider
This is not very exciting and frustrating
=
Why is there no single sister?
I'm good at singing Jisoo.
=
There's no volume so only the Americas go with me
=
Everybody's nice.
=
The song is Achu ~
=
Kay is so cute that she comes to find Lovelyz and cools down.
=
Where did you arrange it?
=
I should have done this at Six Senses. Why did you sneeze and sneeze?
=
2:14 Yuna's face is so funny ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The Queendom is coming out ...
=
Are you going to be sexy? Are you going to be pure?
=
2:20 I expected it to be a bit different, but it's the same thing.
=
No matter how much, I don't have an exponent part ...?
=
I don't think there's an exponent part right now.
=
What are you doing
=
Lovelyz❤
=
When I think about it, how did you eat the exponent part?
=
2:14 Yuna Surprises lol
=
Ah ... why didn't you remix
The song is good and the performance is both good but the two don't seem to be in harmony.
=
2:13 What's up?
=
Kay Evaya
=
Seolhyun, Yuna's face ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
If you go to sexy in a magical clothes that can change the color in the middle, if you go back to cutie at 2nd section, it might have been better.
=
I think I'm heading to Fort Lovelyz Mountain ... the latest new song is innocent but my clothes are sexy ... I'm getting farther away from Lovelyz
=
Why are you dancing? And the atmosphere itself is raging. It's not natural. I don't know the impact ... I don't know.
=
Even if you just put on your clothes,
=
Whenever I keep seeing, sneezing comes out.
=
When I stopped for 20 seconds, I would have felt that Achuha children had grown up if they wore black clothes with other songs.
=
I thought it was like chocolate rice cake
=
It's fun to watch with comments
=
Even though I was sixth in this stage, I think it's better than Six Sense.
=
I watched the stage without knowing both Oh My Girl and Lovelyz. Honestly, the performance of my stage and singing was very good.
=
Angels ♥
=
What are these ...? What did you mean? No money and no sense .....
I'll just take the song as it is ... America? The member only pretends to be fatal to the scabbard .. Oh ..
=
Pane was trying to fan service.
=
Is your head tickling? 2:50
=
So ... Sexy wanted to do it.
You have to make it ...
=
It's not good ...
=
Really. I'm sorry. I think I dipped it in peach.
=
Sexy forward
=
Ah ...
=
I couldn't help but worry about the concept difference with Oh My Girl.
=
Wow ... Lovelyz!
Five..! You turned the stage upside down!
Really..! Best senior ..! Fighting...!
Oh! I think the melody has changed.
I really don't use the window!
=
What's this
=
Lovelyz Achu in my heart ~~~
Even if I always listen to my heart, it's a song ~~~
=
Honestly twisting the mouth
=
Lovelyz's biggest problem seems to be a gesture ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ All the same wink ~ Sal ~ cute gesture ..... ㅠㅠ
=
Eup ... suddenly pollen.
=
I want to be sexy. Tell my agency.
=
I can't see a lovely video about watching Queendom.
=
1:14 I think it's America's Lip Sync, but I'm a singer.
=
Don't keep on sticking to your sexy clothes and dressing them for yourself. If you're going to do it, you'll wink a little bit.
=
Slightly, K seems to be out of sync in the original Achu arranger, Achu expression ,,,,,,,,,. ,,., ..
=
Who soaks and splashes on white paper
=
When I take off my clothes, it's called Achu.
=
Sexy? It's a cute stage. ?
=
Please ... If you're going to be sexy, practice changing your vocalization first ... Your voice is innocent.
=
No expression But even if you're wearing sexy clothes, you're in the background. . . I even arrange the arrangements
The song is just sporty with Jeon ..? Gapbun dance break embarrassment;
=
0:22 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This is Achuani !!!!!
=
ah_chu ranking
1. ah_chu by the sound trainee
2.just ah_chu
3.queen ah_chu
=
This is not a rat!
=
I've come to want you to sing a good sixth song, but here is no answer.
=
3:06 Wow, wow, wow, lol
=
2:02 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅅㅂ Mamamu Dorat ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Respond funny laugh ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
??? : Dan's B.L.E.
??? : Wow
=
1:55 2:44 You're handsome
=
Oh, I'm so sorry. I want you to get off as soon as possible
=
Wow ... It's more serious than the sixth sense ... I can't concentrate on the stage and the song .... Lovelyz wasn't just Lovelyz, but innocent and lovely. Rather than pushing a concept ...
=
I'm rather Destiny.
I wear sexy clothes and wink and I'm practicing.
=
Lovelyz Queendom wasn't coming out!
=
I don't like it and press start. I believe this concept
It's like an outgoing group
=
Hahahaha its a funny face and a sexy face but he's sexy but he has a sexy dance break
I know you want to try something different.
=
It's a pure innocence concept, a cappella at the beginning, a dance with a dance confessing one by one like a musical. I think I'm gone
=
Lovelyz is not a song interpretation problem
There seems to be a lack of confidence in the group.
I don't know if you think the innocent concept doesn't suit you, or if you think you're not competitive.
So I desperately want to go to a concept other than innocence.
=
I think it would be better if we had some arrangements and lost first love concept to do this
=
Kay is real on this stage.
=
I'm just pretending to be cute pretending to be cute ○ _ ○ ..
=
???: ideal and reality are different
=
...........
It's hard for me as a fan to see this .......
=
2:47 Seolhyun's unknown smile is not only a sixth sense ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Visuals look good ...
=
Ryu Soo Jung is so pretty.
=
It's like an organ ...
=
Who's holding my sneezing back?
=
It is despair. Didn't you really compete and get a crown? Academic meeting ?? Far from being sexy, it's worse than a teasing party. Disappointment
=
1:30 Look at Sujin's face in the corner.
=
2:13 sec unexpression
=
Still, the only thing that sings and moves to suit the clothes is the Americas.
=
2:08 It's a performance to see when you turn it off, but in the middle of it, Achu! + Yuna's expression ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ lol
=
Ah ... it's freaking out.
=
It's fresh and nice because it shows various concepts
=
Are you a cameo? If you decorate it a bit, you might not have even reached sixth place.
=
Why is Lovelyz using pretty voices like that? Especially Kay !! The tone is pretty
Why are you like the yellow triangle?
=
1:15 They're lip syncing? Isn't that too much lip sync?
=
Yu-ji doesn't seem motivated to do anything,
=
2:14 2:14 2:14
2:14 2:14 2:14
2:14 2:14 2:14
Now my expression. . .
=
???? No crazy wait
This is the original song
It's an Achu Lovelyz song
A centipede song like this ??????
=
It's really .. I think there's something that's the same as the concept of your group and the omg group, but it's more than you imagined.
=
If you're going to reverse the concept of Achu, you'll tickle the arrangement, just change the accompaniment
=
No ... ㅋㅋㅋ The song itself is synth as well as fresh and plump and lively songs ... If you put the Gulk + sexy concept in addition to it ... Of course it does not suit ... ㅋㅋㅋ .... The whole atmosphere isn't changing ...
Last charismatic facial accompaniment with refreshing background accompaniment.
Nothing to say Really lol Who did you arrange?
And Yu Ji-ae's face looks really serious. . Not AI. .
=
2:03 Ah, it's funny. It feels like looking at a foreign conte ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
If you're going to be a girl, not Achu!
=
AOA came out of the Queendom Cake Lovers came out of the Queendom
=
Ah..
=
2:03 This part reaction is like real hawaii ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I've seen it right now because the concept is sexy, but the song was the same.
=
2:14 밬 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Ah .... it's a terrible hybrid. They don't really go with the galk concept. It's also a lovely name ... You don't hang around hanging around with me ... ㅠㅠ If you're going to put on a costume like that, you'll arrange it.
=
Uh huh ...
This comes out and it looks like the image is negative
=
When I see this, the sneeze that came out seems to go in
=
No, see you again. Why did your company tell you to sing with this concept? And did the members not even protest?
=
Thank you so much for not Destiny.
That's why Oh My Girl's legendary Korean music Destiny was born.
=
It is definitely awkward to feel exactly at the beginning. It's a pity that I don't have the power or energy to dance when I'm lacking in strength and walking hard. Everything feels awkward. The year is also quite good, but lacking interpretation ability and reading the flow of the situation is not good.
=
To be sure, Lovelyz has more threads than Queendom.
=
2:12 2:12 2:12 2:12
Looks like this
=
Noise marketing?
=
Are you ready? Choreography, Arrangement, Concept, Stage Composition
=
How about the bibliography part?
=
No I don't really want to be sexy concept.
=
Just don't come back ^^
=
I'd rather have a different song. I'd like to sing a different song. It's a cute and lovely concept. The concept is much better ㅋㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I just came to listen to the song.
=
2:14 Super mine mines ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
What's this sexy concept about?
=
Seolhyun expression ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I can't see the highlights from the beginning
=
What is that?
=
No but uh! Hyojung is so sleepy when it's Achuani
=
No, it's a little ... I don't think the members agree on the concept ;;; Cutie sexy innocence is playing separately ..
=
I didn't arrange it, so the song feels innocent, but the clothes are so sexy .. I should have done as I did. Miss. Oh my girl pushed me into a dreamy concept. Why did it? ... If you push it as it is, if you push the black song, what should I do?
=
Inspirit Power
=
2:19 It's really reverse. I'm wearing sexy clothes and the song hasn't changed.
=
1:22 This part was really speechless when I first saw ...
=
Lee Myung Bak ^ 3 ^
=
I'm looking at the 2nd first, but I'm curious about the program crew's intention why they appeared ..
=
3: 54-3: 55 I haven't really done it yet.
=
Lovelyz just feels innocent.
=
What did Soyeon think
=
Break-break-
=
Achu seems to be sneezing when you see the lyrics, but I think you'll have to be more vigorous than the original song ... like the cheerleader concept.
Sexy concept should have chosen another song ...
=
Why are you doing this ...
=
How much work do you have for each of your fans? haha
=
Do you know the same thing as this video 2:47 and Omgirl Secret Garden 0:27?
https://youtu.be/H8VFoeJPd9g
=
I think Lovelyz's mentality is very much to read this.
=
Someone said it's a terrible hybrid, but it seems to be d.
=
It's a hit song, but I don't even know when it's been a hit.
=
I'd rather have been wearing the same pure clothes as the original.
=
I don't know the stage bath, but I don't know how to look.
=
Really ... Awesome
=
Lovelyz would like to read the YouTube comments on their stage. If these words are used to nourish and show growth, I am sure that these comments will be replaced with praise. If you don't, you'll be ridiculed on the spot even after 10 years ‥ Don't be upset about it.
=
The members are so embarrassed
=
Hwasa, why did you leave Minnie and K? ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Hye Jung and ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Insisting on the same concept in the meantime ..... it wasn't a fault.
=
Black hahahaha
=
Lovelyz don't really like their concept. I really want to have a sexy concept.
=
2:53 Something I feel guilty about ..
=
I want to come back with a sexy concept, but I'm not sexy, but I'm always sexy;
=
2:14. Funny! LOL ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
There is no answer ...
=
I feel it from the old days, but when I watched Lovelyz's arrangements, I felt like a dog shit. I was worried again.
=
The gesture that was active in Achusigi is left behind, so I don't know if I'm hanging around the sexy girl .. It's really good to challenge new things.
=
Ugh ...... I don't like to see you (⌒ ▽ ⌒) .. ~~~~ TT
=
Oh oh......
=
Why are you cheering fans?
=
2:03 Why are you laughing at the dance brakes? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The lyrics won't be girly.
=
2:14 Hyejeong's expression My expression ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:03 Killing point that I use to see 틐 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm really curious, but who's the one below Lovelyz? I'd be angry and sleepy
Nde
=
If you're going to do costumes and choreography, you can change the arrangement. Why are wallpapers like that, and why did you throw off your jacket? In the meantime, I can't let go of winks and frivolous hands.
=
I'd rather wear a dress like that before, and I'll switch to that when I dance.
=
2:14 Hyejung's face ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Boyfriend Mr. Park Seong-su
=
Think of other singers watching this stage
These guys will win lol
=
The costume match and the song match come back to the song a bit, and it's like the title song and the next song.
=
No, what are you guys doing? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ What is it ... Um ... it looks like this?
=
I don't know why people who always sing innocent + cute are sexy + girly to show a different look ...
=
I can't even sneeze at you
=
It seems like I'm trying to show a variety of stages and appearances.
=
I can't stand it .......
=
Cody Sixth Sense
=
Why is Mamamu here?
This is my first time seeing this because of Six Sense
The difference is not the level where Mamamu will be ??
It looks like Park Bom also
What is the theme of this program?
=
Whew,,,,,,
=
It's not hot, but at the beginning of VIXX's debut
I couldn't sing it.
I have improved a lot now
Even if you can't sing like this,
I can increase my training
There is also an example
Lovelyz Sönen doesn't have a vocal trainer
=
The importance of the costume
=
It's better to just feel princess
=
LOL LOL LOL ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Pollen
=
Even if you had the facial expressions that Destiny showed you ...
And calling it like that was definitely miss.
=
What do you say if you play with expressions and members, and also play costumes and songs? ;; That's why 6th place is a natural result
=
No, this doesn't make sense What is this? Why?
=
Why is Baby Soul different?
=
That's a waste of the rest of the Queendom cast. Suddenly, you become a high school festival. Not only this stage, but sixth sense is not good enough.
=
2:13 Oh my god, it's funny to do it.
=
It's ringing, why are you doing this?
=
No, it's a song, a concept, and I want to try something new. I would rather put different music then ..... ,,
=
Is it because I'm ashamed of seeing you?
=
I watched episode 1, but it looks better than Six Sense
=
It's a shame, but they also wanted to show something besides innocence or lovelyness
That's not what people expect from Lovelyz in the first place ...
In addition, the image of Lovelyz has accumulated the distinctive emotion of Yoon Sang since his debut.
It can be said that it is made and finished so you can't have such sexy or girly conquer ...
Of course it's a contest, so the 'show' stage is important, but the advantage of Lovelyz is vocal.
It was a group that didn't match the program content
=
The first part was good.
=
4:17 No, I've got facial expressions, gestures, music, lyrics, and four. I'm playing with myself .... blah blah blah blah.
=
ㅇㅈㅇ mutters what they do every stage
=
Not baby soul, soulless.
=
The problem is that there is no point of virtue ... There is no reason for virtue ....
=
02:03 Mamamu reaction Something's funny. I remember Hawasu reacted in the old martial arts.
=
Six Senses is a ... but why is it fourth ??? Why are children sixth?
=
2:13 It's just my face.
=
No, please wink if you're going to wink and pretend you're cool, just do it ㅠㅠㅠㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅠ ㅠㅋㅋㅋ
=
I want to blow the stage
=
When everyone choreographed their shoulders, they didn't sing so much that they felt reaction .. ㅋㅋ
=
No citation count private part ??
=
I would rather call pink if I want to gall.
=
If you hit this song, the bell is the most famous and alright
=
Pikachuda Just
=
I know that they understand the concept and the song is really good. You might think it's the same level as the omg girl, but at first you did, but now Omgirl is much better and cooler.
=
Oh really
=
It's my first contest and it's a hit song, so I'm going to go to the innocence first and I'm gull from the second .......
=
Cutie's bright yellow clothes with harness
=
I'd rather bring up another group. Mnet ... It's not a requirement.
=
2:56 Isn't it Sung Jun Hong?
=
Arrangement
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I know the reason for ruin ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅅㅂ ㅠ
=
I feel like eating Nutella on a little pork belly.
=
1:51 Only my mouth looks strange ..?
=
What is it really? Personally, the song is good, but the concept is sexy, the clothes are pretending to be pretty, and the song is a love song.
=
I'm sorry
=
걍 To put it simply, the stage and the costume don't match the song, and the performance on the stage, and the members who bounce off the stage, there are no members. 걍 The program is wrong .. Achu is a hit song, and this song is ruined by your own hands. has exist..
=
I added baby soul to the thumbnail
=
Arrangement is good, but it doesn't match the song and the costume.
=
I'd rather go with a sad feeling ...
=
There are so many members ;;;
=
Throughout this video, Yuna is sincerely ㅡ ㅡ ;; The funniest thing to do is blah blah blah blah blah
=
I was shocked to see that look at 1:15
=
Did you just want a sexy concept?
=
It's all lip-synced
=
Reacting to Hyojung is pretty
=
If I had arranged it, it would have been less awkward; I didn't have any background knowledge about music, but I screwed it up
=
I don't know everything
=
2:14 Viewer expressions ..
=
Something ambiguous ... Lovelyz
Just wearing school uniforms and Achu would have gotten better together.
=
A collection of reactions that I organize for viewing
What's the group 0:19
Omgirl Atsugi 0:46
Seunghee's Oot 0:56
Shu Hwa I forgot 1:02
Ariin's face + Hyojeong's Amo 1:19
Minnie Doomchit 1:30
Seung hee Hook Ok 2:01
뤠 ㅅ Bridge. + Owaau (Kilpo) 2:03
(My expression) 2:14
... Reverse Really 2:19
(............) 2:47
(Uwah) 3:07
댜 쎽 3:16
Pollen pollen (like baby seeing soap bubbles) 3:56
=
I didn't know Lovelyz would do this.
=
No ... I thought it was a sexy concept.
=
Looks like they're watching the Pewdu 1st competition.
=
Self Evaluation Why not? Self-assessment Do not notice the other group
=
I just want to try it once, because sexy and galk are in fashion these days, but I don't have the talent and the ability doesn't ... I feel like that. Girl, you've got me. I think you want to hear this.
=
But why don't you have any bibliographic part
=
2:03 Respond like the minions in solar doors.
=
1:15 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This is so funny
=
2:13 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Look at my face Oh my god
=
I did a hard reversal song ...
I'd rather comment below
If Destiny
I think I've been right here ...
Oh my girl
Lovelyz and the two groups
The little girl
The concept is very good
The reversal cycle is hard.
Aoa did well above expectations
Lovelyz is a pity
=
What are you doing?
=
The Americas are the best suited
=
It's a bit nice to turn off the sound, but I think I put Achu in another song
=
2:47 Seolhyun: Aigoya.
=
madam
=
? 02:43 What's so handsome?
=
The song is good, the dance is good.
=
Let's not say ... There's something to regret again ...
=
The arrangement and choreography seem to be a bit unconcerned .... The contest is literally a contest, not a concert hall with their own fans, but a public + other team fans who didn't know the general public's loves. It is inevitable that the image will fall. Of course I am good at it again
=
As if to make a sexy stage in history
=
1:15 Ah .. too .... funny, sad, hybrid
=
Only me 0:34 K-Fan here is funny and awkward ,,,,? I'm serious but I'm laughing alone and pretending to be pretty I'm conscious of the camera in that choreographer.
=
I came back because I was wondering if there was a difference with Om girl. I didn't want this difference .. I didn't want this difference. ....
=
3:16 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The kids were pretty, so I looked at them like a spectator, and as the real comments say, I didn't think about this one about a song about dance. ..
In the end I saw a lot but ... ☆
=
2:14 What is that ...?
2:47 Oh ...
=
Karaoke
It's like pressing a disco button on an Achu song at Eh ..
=
AOA, Mom, Oh My Girl, Park Bom aren't their songs.
I'm changing my dog ​​coolly
I can't digest it ... View embarrassing.
Levels and bluffs never reach the threshold ...
=
Sound, just give me a sexy, girl song.
=
Even pollen squirms;
=
I like it
=
I know that? I feel like going home
=
I'll just give you a cheerleading version.
=
Why do you think Jin's mouth
=
Take my heart, I'm simple ... responsible ... sister ... take responsibility
=
Kay is the problem.
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I don't know how to react to the singers ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
What is this concept? Am I just confused?
=
Costume is gall
Singing, stage background and expression are pure
The charm of the original song Achu was cut in half and the result was not mixed properly.
In the second stage, the sixth sense cover stage came out because there was no catch.
It's a pity to see the 3rd and 4th stage performance stages.
=
0.6 pounds
=
When I see you laughing with her in the previous version of the arrangement, if you wanted to sneeze and get a concept like this, you shouldn't have to sing this song in the first place.
=
The girl crush concept does not suit the members, but Achu girl crush seems to be a miss ..... This song expresses the tickling heart because of love.
=
It might be better to wear a mask .......
=
This time, I'm glad you showed me well. The group needs some deep discussion.
=
3:16
Mimi says these guys are sexy too.
=
I don't know six senses, but it's a culture shock.
=
jin or too much bite shot too much;
I think your company is an anti singer.
=
Kay, let's talk about it
=
At first I wasn't interested in it and I'm becoming less and less crushed ..
When it comes to Six Senses, they don't have a teamwork when they're on stage.
The lip sync is really open
=
Okay girl and Lovelyz are reevaluated with different meanings through this Queendom.
=
The choreography is similar to the song, but just changing clothes makes the atmosphere sexy ... ??
=
Kay, I'm sorry for being so bad, I love you ♡
=
You have to have quite a few girls
=
If the lip sync is bad, it's going to bleed.
=
2:47 That posture wasn't the attitude that Seolhyun took when she was on stage?
=
Plague ..
=
I've heard of Six Sense Achu, but how can the original singers than Six Sense sing their songs? The concept is perfect ... a song and a distant universe .. a story .. a song .. a choreography.
It's not like this .. Sixth sense was listening to the end, but .. Listening .. .. a little bit of sounding .. Achu .. even though the original song .. I can't hear it.
=
Girly concept with fresh and cute youthful song ..? What was the real ringing
=
Why does Kay keep on winking and squirting like the Sixth Sense?
=
Just like you did in the intro.
=
It's like dancing to a sexy or sexy song ...
=
I feel like eating jjajangmyeon
=
Jelly went into the martang ...
=
Please don't hold on to the elite.
=
The other girl groups are arranged or staged with higher quality, but I don't want to do the original song, so I'm forced to do sexy concept
=
Do you think this suits ...?
Nobody's gonna dry this ..... ??
=
2:47 Seolhyun expression ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Okay = Mnet employees
=
No matter how bad this is, if you want to be sexy, how do you dance with the arrangement? It's just wearing sexy clothes.
=
2:16 Did he get paid? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
1. Arranged song hardly differs from the original
2.The original song does not match the concept
3. Not one of the original and arrangement concepts
=
It's like cheese bulgogi but it's like marshmallow
=
1:19 Arein Pretty
=
2:10 Dance time I choreographed, rolled up and pretended
Kwon Eun-bi slept that way
It's the choreography that sweared at Bae Eun Jung.
Oh my god
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Isn't this a little strange actually? Just be a cute group. Lovelyz just uploads the concept well.
=
Its own words are cute expressions, but everybody has a hard look and a strong costume.
=
Can't really interpret the song
=
I don't know both Oh My Girl and Rubbly, but what I saw in Queendom was the same innocent and lovely concept. .. The harmony of the members is young .. What do you think when standing together as a whole member does not look like the same group ㅠ I feel lacking in the ability to decorate the stage for the song concept ..
=
Why are you sticking to the sexy concept?
=
4:01 DVD Deep!
=
It makes no sense to express sexy with this song in the beginning ...
=
If you don't know the girl's girl, don't be sexy or sexy.
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Real business partners' capitalism action ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Nice to meet you guys ㅓ Seolhyun's Yong-Seon's facial expression ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Ah ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Where is wrong from ..
=
I can't imagine a song like that just by looking at my clothes.
=
Who the hell are you planning?
=
Thumbnails So even the ending poses look awkward These guys are already different groups
=
I want to arrange some arrangements.
=
2: 02 ~ 2:04 lol lol
=
Is Achu going to be sexy? ........... Lovelyz seems to lose a lot more here.
=
At first, I think it's better than a fucking sixth sense, but the more I see it, the more the kin looks like a facial expression at 0:24
=
It would not have been bad even if I continued to lead to the intro atmosphere, but some choreography is a sexy concept (Sabi, Danv).
=
2:13 What
=
The other group members are all dance breaks ~ It's a reverse ~ Oh ~ I'm good at putting in this motive, it's cool It's true that you can't talk about it like this? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
What? .. It wasn't just Six Senses?
=
It's embarrassing to watch a survival audition.
Don't do this
Why are you undressing?
I have to follow the mood. I just change my clothes.
The song is the same as it is.
I'm a former singer and I can't audition more than kids.
America and Jin don't have a lip sync
I'm sorry
=
Mamamu reaction
Wheein: Dance Club
Door, Solar: Wow ~~~~ ...
=
ㄹㅇ If you want to do it with such a concept, you have to open the lyrics .... ㅋㅋ
ex) If you look at me
=
It's reverse. In a different sense
=
Why are they doing this every contest?
=
If you've arranged Achu into a cappella-like version (I don't know why you should die in Queendom and die only in entertainment), then if you wanted to show a secret garden or a closure, even if you wanted to show a gall, if you had a fireworks display, you wouldn't have been the leader of B'Agal. Will
=
Originally, the ringing itself .. Respect the singer's opinion and I think it's not like this atmosphere. Infinite do it as it is. This kind of attention is strong. Lovelyz has many frustrating parts.
=
So the concept is sexy and youthful
=
I know why Group 1 is Group 1 .. ㅋㅋ These days idols are really planning and writing songs.
=
lovelyz? How did you get into Queendom? Spawn or Back
=
I just changed my clothes, something musical ...
=
Oh why is this comment so funny ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅌㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ???????? .. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅌㅌㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅌㅋ ㄱㅇㄱ
=
I love Lovelyz, but I can't see why I can't see it because I watched the stage video of Fort Queen's Stage. The lyrics are shy and aching, sexy and undressing, I don't know what to do, I don't know what the facial expressions are. Let's wake up
=
I feel so lacking to concentrate on the reverse only.
=
Clapping hands
=
2:44 What is this brother?
=
Contest ??? It's not like a contest
=
Yoo Ji-ae is really pretty, but some of the boys who are a bit ugly at the university are like a pretty new girl friend.
=
There's no one in Lovez fans here, it's all bad, why
=
It was a legend if one member was hit when he threw a jacket.
=
2:13 ???: After all ... what ...
=
The members are good, but the arrangements and costumes are so different ... ㅠㅠㅠ
=
No, from the very beginning, that Achu is such a concept itself;
=
Show me your sincerity to at least say a word to your concept. ,,,,,
,
I've got a sneak secret for you
⬇️
I have a hidden face hidden for you
There are so many things I want to tell you
⬇️
There are so many things I only want to tell you
At least I changed the lyrics in this way, and the feeling was different, and later chorus choreographer was also the worst.. There is a cute image that comes from the word Achu itself, but instead of changing the lyrics with chords and choreographing without laughing. I'm trying to change my clothes and I'm trying to change the splits. I'm not sure what the concept is.
=
Didn't we do it now?
=
Ryu Soo-jung Let's get together the hottest elites of the same group. ••• Even in the same group, the image is too bad.
=
I don't think I'll do this stage even if I plan a stage for a high school dance club
=
0:37 What a sleep ...
=
No, this is marketing level ㅅㅂㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ This time, I will see how much it will be again.
=
Lol
=
What does Kay want to be? I want to hit one every time he smiles.
=
AOA 쟤 What's your name?
I can hear what I want to say in 0.3 seconds
=
Yu Ji-ae He looks sick on stage
=
I'd rather arrange a song and taste it .. I want to give it to someone who wants to ... I'm looking like this.
=
I don't know how to reconstruct the concept, but that song is sexy. There's a reason why I don't pick it from entertainment. It's been a year since my debut year.
=
Or if you're going to do black ache, it's better to spill the lyrics.
=
I'm sorry ㄹㅇ My name is Baby Soul ..? Sincerely Rap Monster, Culture Shock
=
Honestly, Lovelyz thinks it's wrong this time ...
=
But it's really strange and strange
The song and the concept are so fine. Even if you try to think of it, it's so cute and bright.
There was a reorganization problem.
If you're sexy and chic
I should have changed it to arrangement
I'm sorry.
I think it's better if you put it together.
=
They don't even know what a centipede looks good on
I'm taking a song from my company and putting the faces that are face-to-face and putting them together in an innocent concept, so I don't know your skills or your concept or anything else !!
=
South than YMCA
=
1:15 What is it, I'm just ruined in Queendom?
=
What's the concept ... I put on my clothes like that, Achu! ♥ I suddenly took off my jacket and turned around and put it on again, and then I took off my real jacket again.
=
What is this? I think I ate spaghetti, miso soup, maratang and macaroons.
=
This is a costume with your friend who is important .. I hate that .. I don't want to be friends.
=
I'm just sorry ... I don't understand what they have. It seems that you need to be objective. ㅠㅠ If you want to be a girl, you must know what girl is.
=
The look is the same as Achu, but if you change the costume to sexy,
=
Holding minutes ?? How long will you have your baby's voice?
=
No ... I'd rather wear the old school uniform and the cherry blossoms would fly off the train tracks, but I didn't make it a confession concept.
=
Ah, I don't care everything. ...
=
2:39 I take off my jacket, am I cold?
=
What's that black costume for Achu?
=
2:57 Aunt from PewD
=
0:08 2:17 What are you doing?
=
2:47 Seolhyun Oh my god ... Oh my god ..
=
If Achu is candy, this Achu feels like just chewing coffee beans?
=
I can't see it at once
=
Oh ~
I screwed ~
=
It was my first spring that the English comments and Korean cokents responded in a consistent way. Achu's hybrid that led to great unity ..... At first I was amazed, but when I came in a couple of times, it's a pity that Lovelyz is sorry ... The next contest is better than the first and second cars! Lovely fighting! (All Mug)
=
Sexy rehabilitation ...?
2:03 Wow!
=
2:13 LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
How did this happen? ....... YOON Sang-hyung please come back ㅠㅠ
=
2:14 What is this?
=
But when you look at the stage of Lovelyz, it's like this and Six Sense, and it shows another charm. It's the same concept, but the facial expressions are the same as the original concept, so I feel like I just changed the costume. So it looks strange than the stage before the original arrangement.
=
The song and the background look refreshing, but the clothes are sexy and the dance is sexy but suddenly the original song is refreshed and moved back and forth.
=
Now let's go see K-pop ~ ^^
=
1:52 It's hard to hide anymore
=
2:47 Seolhyun ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅌㅋㅋ I'm so funny because I know what the expression is. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
What do you want to do?
=
Something that gin ...? It's like my grandmother's mouth with dentures
=
No, neither sexy nor cutie, or what?
=
0:19 0:21 0:24 0:25-What?
1:19 Arin 1:31 Sujin 2:14 Yuna 2:47 Seolhyun
=
5 bytes, not sneeze
=
This is Achu! I thought you were up.
Achu! It's because of the timing of the concept
I thought everyone would advocate
Lovelyz has so many cute images
=
Why did you ...
=
If you come back and cover Achu in the sketchbook
=
I see you take off your robe.
=
Achu doesn't go with sexy at first.
=
Oh really it's uh ... it's not lowering your voice, Mariyang ...
=
Yuna Oh, I've heard what I'm talking about, I've seen and exploded ... Sujin Keeps changing my face.
=
Did you hold innocence as a sexy concept?
=
What is this?
=
I think they're really looking for a sexy concept as well as a concert.
=
Or did you seriously think that this sexy song was a girl? I think the members are thinking ... and even Killville .; Ehyo
=
걍 In the beginning, the hit song is Achura.
=
Ryu Soo Jung ... You're so pretty
=
Lip lips
=
Something .... something just look
=
Or at least edit the song if you want to be sexy.
=
Whooped dance club I'm funny only haha
=
I thought only Six Sense was weird, but I saw Achu 2:14
=
Looks like a golden child y in the middle ...
=
If the concept is sexy, the song must be matched.
=
To show a new look properly 뽷 !! It's good to show you ㅠㅠ .. I'm just disappointed because it keeps showing me obscure. It's a good idea to show a lot of stages because I feel that feeling.
=
There are reasons for those who don't.
=
Lovelyz Why do you keep trying to get out of your concept?
=
Nine Muses Wilde would tell you the wishes of Girls' Generation.
=
This song is innocent. Why is this concept covered by Chinese kids?
=
What is this? I don't think I want to gall
=
How can Achu be interpreted as a sexy concept ...
=
I think it's not made with Lovelyz.
=
Honestly, how do you think about making songs like Achu sexy?
=
I'm sorry for the song
=
I wanted to try this concept quite a bit.
=
Go round here.
=
Why are you doing this?
=
1:20 Hyojeong's sister seems to have come out of a real manga.
=
Let me live
=
I just wanted to make the color of Lovelyz better.
=
If the arrangement is a little dark ... once the voice is too thin and pretty
=
Six Sense curves are a mistake.
=
I'd rather sit in a dress and call on a foggy, dreamy stage with white and peasant farmers.
=
If I'm going to sing, I would have heard a compliment if I came out acoustically .....
=
This stage has no real fun ...
=
I'm a newcomer girl who is much better than them. I know it's been a while since I debuted.
=
Achu! That choreography on that clothes? ㅋㅋㄱ ㅋㄱ ㅋㄱ ㅋㄱ worst
Who planned the stage
=
The group's discretion is so bad that ...
=
I keep the concept of pure and pure .. I wish I had you in the sky and dressed in the sky. % Top
=
Jean ?? Why are you looking at me?
=
Lovelyz feels more and more popular here ...
=
I watched the team and admired them on Youtube.
=
Is the index a back dancer?
No how do I call it 1
=
Song is pure
(Achu ~ ♡)
But the clothes are um ... dress AOA
If you want to make Achu sexy, you have to change the mood of the song, the concept of the costume, the facial expressions, the gestures, but only the costume is sexy.
=
Achu song itself is fluttering, but can I go sexy like this ... Only one member of the intro comes out with a dialogue like a musical Innocent A-yeon and I like you but you do not know my heart? So I'm a bit sad but I still like you. I want to give you food. I'm secretly hidden. Will you accept my heart? I should have gone with this concept. The clothes come to my knees as if it's the first snow, and the A-line lace white dress only makes choreographed Achu point choreography and changes the overall choreography according to the song atmosphere. I think it would be more appropriate to use the same concept
=
No. The members' faces are fresh and their voices are refreshing.
=
Feeling sneezing as a friend pretends to be pretty
=
No, it'd be better to choreograph your dance with a dreamy vagina.
=
Haha I'm really freaking out at this haha ​​I'm funny ㅋ ㅋㅅ ㅋㅎㅋ ㅎㅋㅎㅋ ㅋㅎㄹ ㅋㅅㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ! Wow ~
=
I hope our America is a little humble.
=
The song is done ...
=
No. It's the most popular and popular song in Aluchu, but it's ruined by their hands .. I'm sorry.
=
No. Are you understanding the lyrics and decorating the stage?
=
Do you think they don't really do it because of their concept? I don't think that's the best fit for the group. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'd rather arrange a ballad like a amusement park.
=
I don't want to swear Lovelyz, but it's all true. Please read this comment and understand the concept properly.
=
What the hell is this stage doing?
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No. Why can't I interpret their songs. I'm sorry. I want to be sexy, but I don't have any sexy songs.
=
Did you want to do something sexy and cool like that ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
If you change your costumes and dance, what would be different ... It would have been nice to call it more powerful.
=
Did you ever have a mouth surgery? So unnatural and scared
=
It doesn't make sense .. Really..ha ........
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ There are only two Lovelyz stage videos, but it is so addictive that I watch it twice a day ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
What are you doing ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㄹ
=
Yuna look at 2:13 `` What is that ...? ''
=
2:13 You can't hide her absurdity
2:47 Chilly Seolhyun
=
Ah a. I'm frustrated.
=
Paap ~ ❤
=
2:56 Why Hong Sung-joon is thinking
=
Guys, your group name Lovelyz ... Let's get back.
=
I thought it was 15 minutes, but it was 4 minutes;
=
It was really like a dog crush, but it's like a locksetal in Queendom. Why?
=
You're from Sixth Sense. Are you sexy? The lyrics are so far from sexy ... I wanted to be sexy with this. You should have ripped through the lyrics.
=
Why are you so obsessed with real sexy?
=
Achu ... what should I do?
=
Is it a multipersonal concept?
=
Pahab ~
=
2:14 My goddamn expression,
=
1:51 Why do you do your lips?
=
Ying?
=
Wow! Eating!. ^^!
=
Hyo-jung, it was hard ,,, it was hard to react ,,,,
=
No. So the group of baebae juniors arranges and changes their styles and sings, but they just change their costumes, use the intros differently, and sing with the strange conviction that they will win something without major changes.
=
This is so ... haha
=
too much.......
=
The clothes are sexy, but I can't understand how to dance beautifully ...
=
Why don't you take off one concept?
=
I came to see it for the first time, but if there were any other songs that I could catch with a dark concept, it would have been better to use the black feeling with it. The song is bright, but the atmosphere is a little crunch.
=
No, it's definitely a problem to have six senses, but it's hard to make your own song .... Costume + Background + Dance Break + Expression + Gesture
=
They can't even interpret the song, but it's strange to have the expectation that they'll do the sixth sense properly.
=
I wasn't satisfied with Six Sense ... please stop !!!
=
I've been wondering before, why do you have lips when you sing?
=
2ne1 Son's boat ... Please come to show me this son's boat ... Avengers
=
Not right ...
=
It's so terrible, I came to see you again.
=
It feels like an Unpretty Lilsham ... Why don't you just hang out?
=
Song and Cody are separate.
=
Nine Muses comes to mind ...
=
Songs and dances are sexy as they are ???? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Are other singers out of the Queendom appearing as a pair of hot pants?
=
I'm following my company name
=
So, did you break the dance break?
=
The refreshing accompaniment is the same, why did you go to that? Even if the accompaniment changes a little ...
=
No, guys ... To start with All Black Sexy.
=
I just want to try on those clothes
=
Wow .... I really want to change this image, but I really want to do it. I really want to do it. But I didn't come to blame you for what you want to do ... Honestly, if everyone wears high heels suddenly Isn't it wrong ??? If you're going to change it, you'll have to mix your own color with the color you're looking for. What are you doing? I'm a celebrity. Honestly, I don't have good interpretation skills, I can't act on my face. Let's renovate before we can't repair it. I really like the lovely songs, the concept .. I want to cover it, but it's not really .........
=
Is there a citation part here?
=
No sexy, no girl crush. Just sneezing.
=
Why is this song and why is this costume ??
I like this song, but ... the costume
=
There's no reason for this
=
Achu is a very lovely song, so when I arranged this time, it would be nice to be able to put on the beauty of Achu while adding a dim and dripping sound. The expression is lovely so it doesn't look so good
=
It's a hit song contest, so I'm forced to do Achu .. What did you arrange the rhythm in the karaoke room .. At first, Achu itself is lovely, but there's a girl crush.
=
If you're going to the sexy concept, you have to check it out ...
The expression and the song are cute and innocent, but the costumes and the lights are sexy.
I thought I would do well at first, but the concept itself didn't fit.
=
At this time, why did the other singers choose Oh My Girl under one number?
=
It's a pity that I picked a song differently, or I thought it was a strange arrangement, a sexy concept forced by my outfit.
=
I don't know how bad it is.
=
Is Jin-a's mouth broken?
=
Can't you just be lovely?
=
Now, it was a chance to announce more good songs for the first one like us. The change from the second round .... It's already past ... I'm looking forward to next week !!!
=
1:31 Sujin is crying out in the corner.
=
These guys are just as good as they are.
=
Here's a comment staged by the viewers, but it was reborn as a better work lol.
=
Ha ........ Ha .. Innocent song like this .. Didn't you have to make Destiny ... ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Really bananas are like kimchi.
=
My Oh My Girl Arranged Too Weak Too Low Too Low
Oh My Girl and Lovelyz It's a pure innocent concept ... Lovelyz arrangement ?????
=
Eh?
=
Didn't anyone feel weird ...
=
Well...
=
If you're wearing that kind of outfit
=
If you want to go to Black Lovelyz, you're going to be Destiny. Sneezing! I! Will come! same!! Would you like to ...
=
I see once again why I cannot develop;
=
Incongruity ... rather Destiny
Oh my girl on stage, but the original concept was maintained, but the performance was over in harmony. Achu is so incongruous. The song is cute and the clothes are not changed by wearing black clothes.
=
If you wear black clothes to do sexy concept, you shouldn't have to feel cute.
And vocals are different from other contests and singers who change frequently.
=
It feels like changing the concept too hard We're not just lovely or sexy We can't push too much It's too hard It's really hard to change It's too hard I want to change It's too hard I don't want to repeat the same words
=
Who is the idea of ​​a sexy girl with Achu?
Vocal seems to be very weak.
=
This is me
=
I think it's not really a sexy one except America's Small Crystal.
=
These girls didn't want to come out of Queendom.
=
No, Seolhyun's face, I'm honest
=
2:04 I'm not really swearing at here but I've got to respond to anything.
=
Uh .... Do they have soft hands, winks, and smiles? If you're going to be sexy, change things like arrangements and gestures together. Sexy clothes and music are almost the same.
=
The song seems to have changed the arrangement. After all, the original song suddenly all black? Suddenly sexy ..? Suddenly I took off my jacket .. I took off all those fresh songs and danced.
=
The sad thing about this contest is that this song is a song that comes back after Jisoo has a rumor, but that part is cut off by putting a dance break into a dance break. In this contest, there was no personal part except for singing the highlights. Or standing behind the center is that Daim Achu is a hit song, so it doesn't seem to have subtracted the parts of Jisoo.
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Dark Achu ... ??? Um .. but it's a little unbalanced with the costumes.
=
This group has only one member
Interpret the song correctly or have an idea
I don't know how
Just a frowning finger
I know you can.
=
They say vocals are their strengths, but they don't seem to. Overall, I'm good at it, but my vocals are much weaker than vocals. I don't think there are any members who are able to dance prominently, and I don't know if it's mebo, but the two vocals are the same. And personally, Lovelyz seems to have ambiguous member composition ... The position doesn't seem to be noticeably divided, and the members' image itself is inconsistent. Lee Jung-joo Ryu Jeong-in actually looks better with this costume or sexy concept, but the rest is 걍 ... and Yu Ji-ae is a doll ?? The expression is the same on every stage.
=
I think they want to do sexy decay very much, but they are so lacking in their abilities that they just feel sorry every time they see this stage.
=
I love you
=
2:13 What's that look?
=
This is a funny gel lol
=
Mix match dog lol
Freshness + sexy (?) Almost a fashion leader who will lead this era ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's just like a lip sync until the end of the attachment.
=
2:47 Look at the expression of Seolhyun ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Achu is funny when I dance break.
=
3:16 Everybody's sexy. LOL LOL LOL
=
The costume is what ㅠ middle school dance department is like a festival costume ㅠㅠㅠ choreography ... There are so many things I want to do ~ This part of the skirt is blowing and dancing ... The costume was reversed altogether, but the choreography is still the same Are you giving me?
=
It's so funny to suddenly pose at the end
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Because it's broken, it's at the top ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Ah ... I can't see this.
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ,, ?????????????? ㅋㅋㅋ ??????????
What's this What's this hybrid? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ????????????
=
It's broken, it's coming out ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ How funny
=
If you're arranging, to catch the concept, it's really true! Nicely
=
It doesn't go very well with my clothes.
=
No ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Moonyeol and Solar Wow ~ It's funny to say that it's like a wah-soo ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄲㄲ
=
Seo Ji-soo Baek Danseon ,,, ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ No personal part 1
=
It feels like I've rolled some cake into ramen soup
=
0:43 John Ye
=
Yoo Ji-ae's dancing dogs
=
If I wanted to push it to the girl, I should have done something else.
=
02:13 This is my expression
=
Personally, this is more shocking than Six Sense.
How can I lie down and do sexy performance?
=
The song is squeezing .. but it doesn't fit with Achu ..
=
What kind of concept is this? If you show sexy, you're going to fall into sexy. The song and facial expressions are sporty, but the middle choreography and clothes are sexy ... I love it.
=
From the arrangement ...
=
Uh ... I want to write a note.
=
This is Moya
=
I was wondering that Lovelyz was coming out at first.
=
Did you gather only the kids without real skills?
=
Water and oil levels don't mix. Mix !!!!
=
Any other reaction table information? I feel like this
=
I just didn't feel well until now
=
What did the real Lovelyz think of when I prepared that?
=
I'm not a Lovelyz fan, but I don't know Achu song. It's a concept that I can't understand. I'm sexy because it's muted and aoa.
=
I don't really like sexy but rather sing a cappella or historical drama ... Or reinterpret the sexy songs innocent or the tone itself is far from sexy.
=
If the original song Achu sneezes cute
This feels like spitting
=
The more I do this stage, the more I change my concept ...
=
This is ...
=
...? haha...
=
I'd rather accept it if I had more Butz.
Achurani in that costume ;;
=
The a cappella version would have been tighter, but the arrangement, the clothes, and the dancing triplets don't go with Lovelyz.
=
Kilpo of this video
1:31 2:14 2:48 3:07 3:57
=
What's the reason you want to go sexy? Lovelyz's unique loveliness and spring feeling are attractive. It would be better if you keep it alive.
=
But in the meantime, the costume is pretty.
=
I think that
I came back with a cool concept.
=
A violent case trying to transform the image
=
But there is no original part of Baby Soul ??
=
4 minutes
=
How is sexy with Achu?
=
This is really ‘what are you doing ??’
=
This is only Cody's work .. If it's going to happen, don't cut the image anymore.
=
This is the legendary black art ...
=
I'm pretty, dirty and pretty, so I keep seeing it ㅠㅠ Until it debuted when it was hot in memnool When it was overflowing with officers ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I was in my second year of middle school? Crystal was over pretty, I didn't know how to sing a song Crystal was a towing, Jisoo, Jisoo I knew both the name and the face, especially Jia and Jung, I still loved the white, red, and red color of the face, and the correction was too vivid for the eyes. You've been wearing for a while ,,,,,,,
=
I'm so intrigued at Six Sense.
=
Lovelyz shouldn't come out of Queendom.
=
2:44? V
=
I don't know if it's a thin and lovely concept, but I feel like I'm just trying to be sexy with a lovely song. box..
=
Are you sure you sing other members?
I only feel lip ...
=
Aring clothes are a sexy concept, and if you sing a lovely song, you'll be able to er ... Achu is a sexy arrangement .... The song is still lovely, but the costume is .. ;;
=
If you want to be sexy ..... I'd rather cover the song on Eo later ..... Everyone's effort is virtual and incompetent. What's the problem?
=
Wow .. Personally I love Lovely Azu pendulum lovely Achu pendulum .. Pink Achu K. Cute expression while listening to the lyrics. I want you to melt it and do a good stage so you can come out really cool
=
If you're going to do that, you're not sexy.
=
I thought there was nothing worse than Six Sense, but it was a huge illusion ... How much more is there?
=
It's not good to say that it's a hit song, but it's Achu, but all the other groups go to Mong Hwan, so they're just trying to make it sexy so they don't fit in a fresh song.
=
I prefer six senses
=
Wow
=
I don't think you can change anything
=
Achu is good, but I personally chose us now, so I think it would be better to maximize the innocence and excitement as the Oh My Girl was trying to maximize the dreamy feeling.
=
Kids feel like adultity. There's no match.
=
Did your agency let you do that? But none of the members are weird. I'm sorry about that, but it's not lack of competencies, but I just don't have it ...? ㅠㅠ ... My company doesn't work ....
=
It's a competition, but you have to fight for what you're good at ... I don't know why I'm going to escape the image.
Is it okay?
=
If you want to do Achu, it would have been good to keep the original concept or to make Destiny to suit your outfit! But the Lovelyz visuals are so perfect that I can go up to the second contest !!!!!
=
No, girl, that's not it. .
=
The members are more stylish than anyone else, but I don't have a feeling yet ... like Six Sense ... I'm sorry for many things.
=
Should I turn off the song or close my eyes and listen to the song?
=
These guys don't want to do it, but I know I want to do it, whether it's at a concert or how to get sexy at Achu.
=
It's better than Six Sense here.
=
After Danv, it's just the original song ㅠㅠ ... Ah, even though it overlaps with the concert, the company will give me a little more work.
=
It's hard to see Myung Eun's mouth-tail surgery anymore.
=
Lovelyz was good and innocent and good .. The group recognition was very fast as a singer and no one really deserves to be recognized as a celebrity. It's just .. I feel like I'm going to get an F when 101 comes out. I debuted in the sounding and sang with a Yoon Sang song.
=
This is the only lovely and cutie song I've got, but I'll try to live it well ... I think I'm so obsessed with image transformation.
=
2:41 Seolhyun: What are they doing?
=
Even if you don't open it, you don't dismantle it
=
1:20 Left: Received money to react Right: Representation made by the production staff
=
Achuanmu really unsuitable for sexy concept ...; Did you arrange an arrangement ????????
=
Whether a lion barks or a dog barks anyway
=
2:44 So handsome!
=
I'm playing Queen Queen's back drum, so I heard today for the first time. Arrangement and choreography were bothersome.
=
Original song and song are the same ㅋㅋㅋ What's changed?
=
The agency is also a problem. The arrangement and costumes are rough and sexy concept transformation.
I'm just sorry now. What's wrong with the agency?
=
Ah ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
2:47 Seolhyun's sister
=
1:17 endured, but at 2:37 I turned it off with real anti-magical power. I want to run and re-dress one by one not to take off the jacket.
=
2:40 Throw it off my jacket lol What is this concept?
=
2:13 My look at this
=
2:50 It tickles me hard
=
3:16 Mimi soul business ..
=
1:30 Right handed realityReaction
=
I'm still wondering why I was wearing that costume
=
With, really nasty,
=
What's coming out, what's going to be different
It was just Achu Baccarat + Dark version
=
It's a refreshing song that I take off my jacket and I feel like the dance clubs are going to reverse it.
=
Opening is cool, but why does the opening never stop?
=
Are you surprised by the intro?
=
Where is the bibliography part?
=
No costume match, I'm wearing costume black.
=
I'm good at K, but I can understand the concept of the song.
=
It's really crowded .... I can't see
=
Why do you take off your clothes
So it's Achu
=
Achu I remember is not this
=
I can only see the main vocal forehead ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The one hit wonder idol has only one jingle song
With the ability to analyze music, I held the concept and staged it.
Rainbow, Nine Muses was so sad
The stage where you can see why they weren't able to ...
=
Funny thing here!
1. Kay wearing a suit and smiling in the intro
2. Smile and suddenly raise your eyebrows
3. Arm angle is different Achu ~!
4. The lips are all lovely
5. Audience with Surprise + Embarrassed Expression
6. Ain ?????????? Suddenly take off one's coat
=
When I hold my pair in the early stages, I hold my mouth ... I really want to do something
=
Oh my girl didn't sing too much
=
I want to be cute, I want to be a girl, I want to be sexy, I want to be young
I'm confused;
=
Why am I ashamed
=
Ahh, it's broken, but it just pops up ... What does it matter? Six senses should float
=
What is this?
=
Ah ... I don't watch the Queen's program.
=
Worst of all,
=
1:14 Lipsing Pail
=
I can see the sixth sense to the end, but I can't see this ... It's a good stage to see Achu when it comes to danv.
=
To put it nicely, it fits so well with this concept, and badly, not this concept.
=
Except for the Danves
=
Replying to @JustinLee
=
Shock zone
=
Are you sure you don't know what these things are?
=
Please dress tennis skirt ....
=
I wish I had a lot more songs with the concept
=
What is sexy for them?
=
I think they want to have a sexy concept, but it doesn't go very well with the songs.
=
It's harder to see than the sixth sense ... I feel so isolated so I don't know how to react. I'd rather play other songs. If so, then it's good to have the right tandem for them.
=
Please ring ... please ...
=
2:14 Explain everything with this expression haha. LOL
=
1:15 Why aren't you singing?
=
You only hear this with your ears It's just like listening to the original song ... If you put that performance on that really vivid beat? What would you do?
=
ㅇㅅㅇ ...? No, what is it like to wear Achu and call Achu?
=
Just call me pink with lace ...
Like a person who doesn't understand a song
Not at all
=
Do you have any parts?
=
Personally, Lovelyz is pretty and there are many good songs.
=
It's like a high school dance club ...
=
It's a sexy concept, but the face is refreshingly potent + wink + smiley
=
If you sneeze, you have to wear warm clothes.
=
Even if I swear the arranger ... I wanted to go to that song in a sexy concept, but I'm sorry. But how to arrange that song is hard to change to sexy. .
=
보고 .... I've been watching Six Senses and this is more shocking ...
=
I'm just changing my clothes
=
Why do you think your strengths are weaknesses?
=
I can't believe it
=
Singing and the stage concept is not so good.
=
Dance break school retreat. Long-term pride class.
=
What concept
=
You know you're sexy? You know sexy? I think it will fall further
=
I really wanted to do the Senka sexy concept.
Wear all black on these fresh songs
Take off your coat
In the middle of the arrangement
I don't see the identity as if it were this team
=
Perfect up to 10 seconds.
=
If you're going to be sexy, you should have made a different arrangement. The viewers are cognitive dissonance.
=
Is it just because you want to wear such sexy clothes?
=
Do what you did. Do not try to reverse the contest. You don't need a variety of looks. Lovelyz is already over. The song is a big thug.
=
If you want to change the concept from an existing song, go to Wow or Destiny.
=
The concept of the song and the concept of the stage does not match either ㅠㅠ But there was nothing to see on stage ...
=
At first, everyone was still struggling, but as time goes by, there are two members who have not developed. You can be the best if you acknowledge yourself and help around you. I'm sorry ...
=
Still, I thought I could go up the floor and climb again on the first stage, but in the second, I dug up the pit.
=
It's all old except for this, are you sure?
=
Would you rather power innocence? If you arrange it like a girlfriend ...
=
These stages aren't coming in well, but they're coming in to see comments ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No surge parts
=
If you dance like that and pretend to be sexy, it's not Achu! Punch !!! I should do it.
=
I'd rather go with a monotonous atmosphere like my Destiny .. That gemo .. ^^ If you think of a white dress, the coolness comes to mind first.
=
Champon
=
The concept of the song is refreshing and sexy. So what do you feel ????
=
No just funny lol
=
Only six senses
I thought it was ... I can't do it
=
Why are you still looking for sexy? I think that sexy should go into costumes and dances ..... The purpose is to do what they wanted to do.
=
2:13 Facial expression
=
2:52 I don't really know K's pretty, but I think it's pretty pretending. It's like a real forearm slap in the armpits. The same group is not beautiful but it's a beautiful woman.
=
I think it's better than Six Sense.
=
It's a creepy thing to do with head banging on the floor.,
=
2:14 Our look at this stage
=
I'd rather be a god like kids
I'm bringing new guys like Everglow, Cherry Bletch ...
=
Seolhyun expression: I try ... ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:13 Yuna ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The other groups react too business ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㄲ ㄱㅋㅋ
=
2:47 Seolhyun expression ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No, it really doesn't go well with costumes and songs.
=
2:13 What song is it?
=
Lovelyz, you're coming out of Queendom and having a hard time lol
=
2:13 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:11 Chews
=
It's like a guy who just wanted to wear such clothes ... Melody and melody voices are lovely, but I think I threw them
=
I'm thinking of calling Achu as a sexy version.
=
Um ... shouldn't we start with unity?
=
ㅋㅋㄱ ㅋㄱ ㄱㄱㅋ what ?????????? Lyrics and voices sound like a baby.
=
Ah ~ Chu! I'll be better at this
=
Mamamu Wow at 2:03! I don't have a soul but I think I know why.
=
Ah it would have been okay if I just wore other clothes ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Oh
=
Lovelyz needs a talented leader who can surely grab aoa jimin children need something to lead or say something like Soyeon
=
The song itself is innocent, but it's more awkward because it's sexy.
=
I wish I could wear Destiny or something like that.
=
19pass My Mac My My My Mac
=
There's something like this
=
The concept is also sexy, but it looks sexy or girly, but it doesn't match any lyrics or songs, and the look is just innocent.
=
??? : uh? This is Achuani.
??? : What is it??
Achuya
=
Ah haha ​​I just wear clothes like that hahahaha
=
What does Bae Yoon Jung look like?
=
No, I feel like I'm pretending to be the original Achu and pretending to be sexy
=
Really hard to bear
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ The other group's ticket information is answered ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Yuna expression = My expression
=
But it's the worst ...
=
Everybody's sexy ~ LOL
=
Is that so ??? haha ​​I can't see it.
=
America's Obaya
=
That clothes in Achu ... I play concept and song separately.
=
Such a fresh song with a costume like this? Oh, my God
=
Ah Jin, this is also a sixth sense lip-syncing from start to finish Make it fun ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅌㅌㅌ If you are a singer, sing one song properly
=
AOA Short skirt, I'm really shocked.
=
What is that?
=
If it's a cute style song, it's just cuteness.
=
I think it would be better if I went to the Lovelyz concept
=
Can't answer that ...
=
No. But nobody really thought that this was Ebada when you made up the stage like this? Really..?
=
1:12 Does this look right with the lyrics?
=
I love this song ♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
I really like this song.
=
Are you sexy when you take off?
=
You guys are choreographed too ... What kind of jacket do you throw?
=
Too bad for clothes and songs ;;;
=
Sexy??? Not this, not that, haha
=
Seo Ji-soo is so innocent, youthful, pretty, and just like the first love ... Lovelyz is a girl's generation than Beau girl. It's probably better suited. It looks like a face
=
It's like a floor
=
No, the song and the concept don't fit, and I just don't know what to do. And I'm always looking for a sexy girl with a tone
=
Who's catching the concept? In addition to this ...
=
It's like the Brave Girls. Like Rollin's fresh song and sexy costumes and choreography, but I'd like to be a lovely group. Sense is not worth saying
=
I want to believe Mnet changed the sound.
=
Of course, you might want to change your song and debut, you might want to try this or that concept.
=
I'm busy doing the ringing rocket punch. Or are you trying to educate the kids with this opportunity?
=
If the song is refreshing, you can change the concept, or if you're going to do that, try the beat or arrangement well, or just ruin it all, and the song is refreshing and the concept is sexy.
=
It's a song that should be called with a fresh charm.
=
Too bad ...
=
??? I'm looking at the costume again Oh, I'm not sure what the concept of this girl's girl is Achu ... Ah ... What?
=
If you were more concerned about arrangement and choreography, you could cover the lyrics with the feeling that 'I'm not a person who cooks or cooks, but I'm learning because of you.' The choreography is so pink
=
Honestly, comments are more fun than watching a video.
=
If you're going to do that, I'll fix the point choreography.
=
No ... Girl Crush Sexy wants to do this ... Some members still want to be cute innocent? I think it's a girl if you just dress like that. Is it possible to unify opinions among members?
=
Why don't you arrange the song? Change the mood. Why do you call Achu with that costume?
=
No, it's a bit dark at the beginning of the world, and I'm a bit toned down, like a little Rapunzel blackening, something like that. Is sincere
=
Go ahead and grab the arrangement
=
Warm Ice Americano,
=
Achu is so good anytime.
=
I think it's about 6 years, but I can't interpret my song yet ... I don't know what their strengths are. The song and lyrics are fresh, but the clothes don't fit.
=
I'm going to sneeze
=
2:14 Ena expression = inner expression
=
I'm not this either.
=
There are no compliments .. Sad but I can't help it.
=
Creepy in a bad way
=
No, I know you want to do the sexy concept, but some of you have to do it.
=
I'm a fan of Lovelyz concerts every time, but the selections and concepts are so superb. There are many gems like gems,
Among the geniuses who are good at arranging the genius, Yoon Sang-on is the only planning issue.
=
I'm naked because I look naked. This song is pure innocence.
=
This is not the case that your company does not work, but the name of the company by the company's name to some extent not to know ...
=
No ... Achulang, costumes, dances and arrangements don't all fit together ... It's amazing to sing your own songs like this.
=
1:15 This is sexy // 2:27 This is cute> <
I will not have to match the concept !!! Ha ha ha
1:24 This is the secret agent 곸 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
2:14 // 2:47 Facial expression management failed ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Sexy or pure or cognitive dissonance is the concept ... truly bizarre stage
=
They don't understand their songs
=
Lovelyz seems to have to go all the way to one concept lol.
=
In the ending, the sweet piano sounds and the costume don't really match.
=
Real stage composition sincerely, I'll get better than that .. ,, ..... Ehe
=
Yoo Ji-ae's so light. The movement isn't cool ...
=
Let's change the lyrics and choreography.
=
What is that costume? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Cody What are you doing? .......? ..... tears ...
=
2:13 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I thought it was my expression. What is this ...?? This feeling
=
1:13 Lip sync..Tina too much ...
=
2:03 Oh this is funny even after seeing it a few times lol
When you eat Wow ~
=
Ah, what are you doing?
=
2:14
2:47
Unhideable collection of expressions
=
Seung Hee, Reaction Artisan ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
+ Just go to the sputum ... I think I'm going to squeeze it.
=
This video is like a drug video .. It's so funny that I come in every day .. After the 2nd contest, I saw the 2nd was the second class.
I'm waiting for what stage Lovelyz will bring now.
=
2:13 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:13 Oh what is that?
=
What should I do ...
=
It's a pity that I can't give it below sixth.
=
I'm coming here to see a comment ,,,, ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL
=
Love Part 2:02 Dan Break
=
Oh, please think about the lyrics too! ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
See-through in the sole
=
Seolhyun's face is the most fun
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ What kind of hybrid is this ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Cute lyrics + Thin tone + Sexy choreographies that seem to come out of the concept + Traditional choreography + Costume that seems to be replaced with girl crush ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Honestly what the singers out there is not that?
=
Everyone seems to be in a hurry to change the image too.
It's a shame that your group's image is good enough to impress the public.
=
ㅅㅂㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm reinterpreting the song that Yoon Sang Producer made youthful in this way ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Please apologize to Yoon Sang Producer ...
=
To be honest, the song is sexy and the song doesn't match the clothes, so it feels like a separate play.
=
If you look at your clothes, I think you're going to be sexy ... If you stay still, there's a saying that you're half as good.
=
1:15 Is this even a lip sync?
=
3:19 rang 3:33 If you had a bit more euphoria, you would have gone half.
=
3:19 rang 3:33 If you had a bit more euphoria, you would have gone half.
=
When I sang a song on the radio or on the radio, it was a pleasant and refreshing feeling.
=
The costume, dance, and acting concept is good, but the selection of the songs ... I wish I could have arranged some arrangements ... Yoon Sang-hyung .. Brother's songs are really good songs. Trust yourself and think well about where to use it.
=
There's something to do and nothing
And not just build their charm
Rather, it seems to ruin
=
Sexy at Achu is not real
=
It's not Achu.
=
The next part of the tie ~
=
Boredom
=
There are eight members, but none of them says "Hey this is not it"? 5 years?
=
It's a very pure song that can't be a girl crush. Why did you want to make it a girl crush? ㅠㅠㅠ Swearing ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm sorry. Lovelyz isn't it crazy?
=
First time ..... are you sexy?
01:11-No ... It's not sexy. Please ..
01:55-ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
02:39-I'm not seeing comment window
=
I want to pull out the Americas .....
=
Oh my god, there's nothing like taking off your jacket and looking at your intro.
=
What concept? . !!! ???
=
Oh my ears hurts my eyes hurts
=
Gosh...
=
2:46 haha
=
I want to keep the fan.
=
It's definitely a thin voice, so when you sing this song, you know why you got it innocent.
=
How do you think the company itself is not working? Is it just a project that pushes me back and doesn't seem to see the existing annual team?
=
Let's just be lovely ...
=
Didn't any of them disagree with this opinion? .. why
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ lip sync true story ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Have you ever wanted to wear a sexy outfit?
=
Ah ........
=
But there are also some composers who wrote their songs and asked them to arrange them.
=
It's not good, but the bread is pretty.
=
I'm good at arranging arrangements and changing choreography to make me sexy or not to save pure innocence.
=
I know I tried, but I'll go with a fresh concept. Just one sexy concept.
=
I can see that I want to do the chic concept.
=
I'm asking you ...
I'm not a person who dislikes or hates real Lovelyz.
Uh, are you the one who wore the top right in the group shot in 4:19?
=
By this time, the company did not work too much ... Six Senses was a real sixth sense reversal.
=
It's a pity that the concept that they want and the song that the company gives isn't right ... They'd know that it wouldn't work with that song .. But I wanted to try another concept.
=
No, it's different from the costumes. I'm fine if I wear my clothes. I'm really 10000 times better than Six Senses. Why did Six Senses go for me? Or are you looking at Sixsen?
=
If you really wanted to do black Achu, you should have arranged a choreography gesture. If you wear only black clothes, what do you do?
=
1.Costume selection: failure
2. Arrangement: Failure
3.Concept: Failure
4. Too ordinary stage composition
5.Children's Beauty: Leeds
6.Singing power:
Conclusion: what are you doing?
=
Mnet doesn't have to pay for the production cost, just turn on the air conditioner in the hall.
=
2:15 Who are you?
=
It was a good mood concept at that time, but I want to go back to it. I sing along and sing at the retreat.
=
Is it a lip sync? Anyway, I didn't fight because I wasn't the best group.
=
No, but I think it's because Achu wrote a sergeant, and wrote a lyric like the lyrics. Oh my girl's secret garden and pretty and dreamy lyrics.
=
Oh, it could have been better to arrange the vocals more calmly .... The original song itself has a nice lyrics and a clear feeling, so it could have been better to make it more harmonious or go to a ballad feeling.
=
When I was proud of my long-term career at school, the guys who gave me dance breaks with the concept of a big sister started to sing right away. I don't have time to change clothes. If you only do one; Arrange arrangements or tune into a song;
=
Arrangement, costumes, choreography .. Isn't it too weird with the song?
=
But Oh My Girl was the best in their strengths (I'm sorry if you're a bad Lovelyz fan)
=
I love Lovelyz but I still can't see the tea
=
How are you doing?
=
I take a cold off in this weather so I have a cold.
=
2:53 I can't stand either, Kay.
=
The real song is pretty and cute
I don't know why costumes and danves are so sexy.
This doesn't fit at all
=
Why do other singers react to me?
=
No ... no sisters
I really liked the Achu song and the stage when I was in high school. How much did this song hit?
=
Concept too obscure .. I would rather Destiny .. I made Achu hybrid and I got destiny from Omgirl, a real hybrid.
=
Are you sexy if you only wear black clothes?
What's different from Achu?
The other group has its own color
I arranged everything but these are cover levels
=
I would have liked the bright concept as well as the uniform
=
Mamamu reaction real story ??? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Wow ~ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Seolhyun expression = My expression ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:13 seconds ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Mother looks really ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:03 Hey hahahaha Why are you reacting to me? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:19 Half I.
=
2:14 Hyejung: Oh my ...!
=
04:12 Ending What are you looking at? I'm embarrassed. What's that sexy melody with that pretty melody?
=
2:14 Facial expression ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I don't know how
=
3:15 You're fucking empty.
=
2:14 = inner expression = great party;; Who is Achu from the sexy danves! Like this
+ My imagination is full of sneezing when I take off my jacket.
No, it's really Achu and why is the concept?
Pollen is pouring out ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The best comedy in Queendom.
=
Ah .... I'm not so magical ..... I can't see you anymore. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Who's the reason why no one's saying that sexy version Achu is not allowed ... ??? Have you ever fought with company officials? The ending is so sexy. Melody is goodbye.
=
No ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I did a little song properly ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Wearing clothes like that and the pitch is the same fresh! What's changed when you ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Lip sync in quality ...
=
I came to see Six Sense.
=
Lovelyz ㅠㅠㅠ Back to 2014-2015
=
2:14 my expression
=
Aside from the arrangement, why are you dressed like that? I came running for another event.
=
2:14 I'll have to capture it and send it out without saying anything.
=
It's not too bad .... Stage mistake is a mistake and something is wrong
=
Ok!
=
Arrangement ignoring lyrics
=
What did they want to show ...?
=
If you look at other people's reactions, you're trying to react.
=
It's okay to go back to innocence on the wall❤ What's this combination? But in the second, the exponential look attractive.
=
I want to dress like that
If you have a different mood or take off your jacket, you should be able to invert the mood by playing high notes.
=
I love sexy
=
Um ... mutations
=
chaos...
=
What kind of terrible hybrid is this ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ The concept of costumes, songs, facial expressions, choreography, and stage productions doesn't fit properly ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's hard to see until the end ... ;;
=
Kay wants to look sexy ?? Why do you keep smiling and bewitching not like the concept?
=
Before that, I was lovingly hungry and pretended to be the last sudden ending pose.
=
The concept is not really good for calling. I like sexy concept.
I'm going to go to the stage.
=
If you sneeze out there, don't throw it off and wear it again .............
=
Let's stop sexy Lovelyz
=
It's embarrassing. It's difficult. Lovelyz is definitely a group with a concept.
=
Stick to the Achu concept Why did you call this Achu? I wonder who designed this
=
Who knows what's changed except for the clothes?
=
* 2: 14 * * This * * what * *** expression *
=
There's a strange empathy
=
I feel like I wasn't choreographed when I wasn't.
=
Funny comments ~~~~
=
Only the color of the clothes, even though it was bright,
=
I'd rather have Destiny in the first contest and a secret garden in the second.
=
It's ridiculous that it's been five years since your debut.
=
If your company arranges this and decides on a clothing concept
It's not really real and they wanted it
I don't have a thought. I don't understand.
=
If you look at the real expressions of your fellow singers, the reaction is already
=
It's just ringing Nowadays I only care about the rocket punch
=
Just turn off the sound and see ...
=
1:15 make you laugh
=
Is your company lost their feelings?
=
Lovelyz Please don't try to change the image here
=
Mismatch
=
I think that.
There's a humorous video that puts a funny song on an exo song about the importance of music.
It's funny because it's a cute song
=
Just sell their coffins
=
It's chaos. Black sexy costume. Powerful danv. Flower fluttering. Lovely song and expression .. Should I be sexy or adorable?
=
I really don't know why the group's name is Lovelyz No I don't know why it's flower powder in the lyrics Let's change the concept unconditionally Sexy Let's put a chain around the neck Isn't it the academic orthodoxy that he's been trying to get Lovelyz down?
=
...? The concept wasn't so good Why are you so sexy? If you're going to sing this, shouldn't you have had a different concept or a lot of arrangements?
=
Good song .. Why did you do that? The kids seem to be pure innocence ... the other teams are trying to react. ‍♀️
=
I don't know if it's out of sync, but I think I'm too lip synced. Especially at first.
=
2:14 my expression
=
I'd rather have done it better like Oh My Girl ... I'm sorry to hear that song I personally liked.
=
If you want to do girl crush, it's Destiny.
=
What a terrible hybrid ... Costumes, songs and lyrics don't match at all.
I don't know if I didn't see this program, but are you contesting yourself?
The concept is really confusing
=
Now it's just a pity .. I've never seen or listened to idols, but as a person who loved Ohmy because of Queendom, I'm just sorry .... If you do better, you'll have a lot of inflow fans.
=
I just wished I could dress in pretty clothes and arrange it more beautifully.
=
I think the intro was fine ... If you're going to be sexy, I'd rather arrange for complete forging.
=
Jin's mouth looks just unnatural.
=
I've seen the Six Senses cover, and I've also seen it. If you want to have such a concept, Lovelyz is a derivative group like Girls' Generation Taticer or C-Star's C-Star19? I think it's better to make a couple of kids like Jean Mi-joo Baby Soul.
=
Why are you naked? Was it hot
=
Ah haha ​​lol Why don't you sing?
=
I'm always good at live and why are you lip-syncing ...
=
Why do you want to be so sexy? If you were to do sexy, you would have to arrange more songs or sing a different song.
=
When I was in high school, dance girls were wearing tight clothes, and I felt like when I finally played a girl group song,
=
You guys are so upset. Chicken is coming late ??
=
What would you have been like if you were in a uniform and collaborate with a band? I think it's better than hybrids
=
Cheer up, Lovelyz.
=
Something like Miss A. Hershey ...
=
2:47 Seolhyun's face is so ... why are you taking off your jacket? It looks like this ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
ㅠㅠㅠ you wanted to go sexy a lot
Then the song should be arranged like that.
Only clothes are exposed
The expression is refreshing, the melody is refreshing, the lyrics are refreshing, but where should I focus on?
=
It's a terrible hybrid. Who's the world?
=
2:28 No I'm sad to see this
=
I play with the costumes and the songs too ..
=
LOL LOL Laughing Slang and absurdity of concept LOL
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ No what is this ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Black Achu!
=
Melodies are bright in the world, but their clothes are dark in the world .... ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
-Everybody's sexy
-Really
=
2:00 ..... uh ........
=
1:50 But what about my lips? How did your mouth tail look so pretty? Are you a filler? What a wonderful yet wonderful ... 쩝
=
Kei, I really like the song.
=
2:14 My expression looking late at this ...
=
The song is awful and the costume is hush ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'm going crazy
=
Put on that suit and look like a gun.
=
If I had to change the concept or make the arrangement harder, it would have been a legend.
=
I told you this, but ... the worst
=
This is what the concept is ...
=
How do you think you're less capable of interpreting songs than the trainees who covered their songs in PewDou48?
=
There's a reason why you can't do it in the middle ........
=
2:14 Yuna's expression
=
I came here again after the second round. Just say cheer up .. ㅠㅠ NO sexy provocations on stage and costumes ..
=
Ome what's going on?
Achu ♡ but the clothes are sexy.
=
If you put a league on an idol group
k-league second class?
=
But Jean? Does he have too much moisture on his lips, so his upper lip is curled up in his gums? I keep seeing only his mouth
=
I like costumes and danves but they don't go so well with songs.
=
What are you doing? ... Why are you choreographing?
Wow, it's all cute, so please don't concept
There is a reason why the company insists on the existing concept.
=
Why put sexy in Achu ...;
=
???????? I was surprised because it didn't go too much with the outfit and the song atmosphere.
=
Laughing and revenge ...?
=
No, I already want to go to sexy concept alone, spring, something is going to happen.
=
Honestly, the stage is too squeezed .....
=
Lovelyz
I don't know sexy
Gesture now
Every single song or action
It doesn't look so good
=
What's the arrangement?
=
Right behind it was aoa.
=
If it's going to happen, I'll just dress it as original ...
=
Sixth look, but Achu came to see you do it well because they're singing. If you touch only the intro and change the costume and performance 180 degrees, what do you think?
=
What did you express?
=
Edit Why are you doing this ...?
=
No song, expression, gesture, voice, tone, shit. I'm so foolish and innocent. I only do sexy costumes and dances. What are you doing?
=
I think you're expecting a Girl's Day costume.
=
Audience Hong Sung-joon Kim Si-hoon
=
If you're going to do this, why are the kids here? It's hard to pay like this
=
No one's agency here why .. B1A4 like coping when I couldn't coordinate ;; No, the song is pure and innocent
=
No Shiva, this is not real
=
Why is the boat
=
I'm really curious but don't want to re-sign a lovelyz agency? How can you ...
=
Ah.Why am I ashamed ;;
=
If you wanted to do the sexy concept, you might want to do melodies or choreography differently, but this is not this, but it's not like that.
=
It's too original to be arranged. Even mismatch of lyrics and costumes ;;; The lyrics are cute and pure pure, but the look is pretending to be a sexy girl. Sincere total difficulties.
2:13 Una expression My expression "What is that hybrid?
=
Stop ... This is not ...
=
I'd rather arrange a song ... or just sing.
=
Terrible hybrids are the words used for this.
=
Ah, the costume is scary and sexy but the song is Achu ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
It's my personal idea but I don't have much arrangements yet.
Lovelyz is good for them.
I think I did it, but what kind of hybrid is it?
The second contest was also B'Agirl Six Sense.
Is it Kay? Why did you give her the pop part? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Pa-hap.
Like they didn't watch B-girl before the second contest
=
Nachu It's a bit dreamy, so it's a dreamy concept.
I threw away an image in my group, but the song feels the same.
=
The costume is like Nine Muses or tiara cry cry, but the song lyrics ... I'd rather have someone else edit this costume and dance.
=
I didn't arrange it, and the clothes didn't fit so well.
=
This song is so cute that it can't be arranged .. I've just changed my dance and costumes ... but I personally like my favorite idol song.
=
Oh ... what's that? I think it's better to keep the concept like oh my girl and wear bright or skyy clothes.
=
Really ... Playful ... Achu is a pure and clean image, but Cody's anti ... Concept's Junke Jung-gu heating? Haha ... Lovely's first contest
=
Who did you plan for this ????? ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm not a fan of Lovelyz fans, but I like the concept too.
=
Should I have arranged for Girl Crush?
I feel like I've lost everything
As a person who loves Lovelyz songs, love songs have a dim and dreamy atmosphere, so I loved it.
=
There's nothing special and the biggest problem is that Achu and sexy don't go together ... Who planned?
=
Let's be lovely
=
It's not annoying to arrange
=
I just sing the song without the arrangement.
=
I think these sexy people really wanted to
=
How excited would it be if you read this letter under the cherry blossoms in the 70's school uniform and hide it behind the tree? First love recall
=
No. What do you do when you arrange?
=
The song was sporty but the concept was sexy.
I would rather wish to arrange the arrangements again ... or arrange them dark or go to the rock version ...
Or listen to the ballad version Achu called by Jung Seung-hwan. Even though it's about one measure, it can sound like a completely different song, so it's not like sneezing but it's a crustal angulation ... It's your own song.
Now this is a strange stage because of the lack of audio and video.
=
I feel like I can't do this when I'm going to do this or not.
=
2:14 Oh what is that ????????
=
Oh .. I didn't think it was 6th. I don't know how to arrange the stage.
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Lovelyz Why did you do this?
=
Wow I sweared at the agency but this is not 100% of the agency ㅠㅠ
=
My singing voice and facial expressions are still cute, but my dancing and costumes are so sexy.
=
2:13 What?
=
Lovelyz doesn't hang out with girl crush, but the kids are so thin--but they don't
=
Ah ... what should I do?
=
I don't know if the arrangement is that way, but I'm holding a pure song and doing sexy dance.
=
4:18 What's the harmony between endings and piano melody in sexy melodies? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The concept is sexy. Cutie. What is it? I can't tell you anything.
=
Ah.
=
2:14 Our expression
=
AOA facial expression.
=
In the beginning, the idea that someone would put sexy into a cute and lovely song came from someone's head. ;;;
=
I should have sung it at their concerts.
=
The clothes style goes well together but the song doesn't work
=
2:04 2:13 2:20 I'm constantly coming in to see other singers' reactions
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋㅋ More than sixth sense 환 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㄱ Why is it so real?
=
02:03 But isn't it normal break dance? LOL Dance Break! I feel like I'm dancing
=
Achu is the magic of masterpieces
=
So hard ..
=
Please don't do this ... ??????
You're all abusive
=
Um ... I'd rather just do the original song .. Why did you just turn your hair .. Um ... That costume ... Um .... No. This is TT. I'd rather reinterpret Destiny.
=
Resistance test level
=
The focus is so focused on the change that the original charm is diminished
=
I don't want to wear clothes and songs.
=
I would rather be Destiny in that costume. Why did you do Achu?
=
Lovelyz wants to do sexy concept haha
=
Wow, I'm watching the Sixth Senses Lovelyz first performance ..... what did you see this for the first time?
=
Did you decide to slap Lovelyz and push it with a rocket punch?
=
The song was not suitable for a song or a song that seemed to go wrong, but it was anti-war and I thought I made it well in my company's line.
=
I'd rather wear a dress and blow the pollen to make me feel spring.
=
My facial expression when I came in to see Achu 2:13
=
I'd rather wear a pastel suit and be more powerful.
=
I'd rather have half the ballad version
=
Wow, I went to see the first round after watching the second contest.
=
What is the body chain ... Please.
=
I wonder where the bibliographic part is going ;;
=
Hey guys .... If they don't have the ability, even their agency should be capable.
=
I can hear Yoon Sang-hyun's crying.
=
what? The concept is cha-doh, but the song is refreshing.
=
Yoo Ji-ae really debuted
=
It would be much better for me to wear such a dress that would be worn by a clever dress or a rich girl who gave me a gold point.
=
My expression 2:13
=
The clothes are a sexy concept, but the song is just an innocent song.
=
I just wear clothes. Sexy concept song is original lip sync
=
No, I can't cook yet, but a person who practiced clothes like that ?? I'll just tell you to eat as you are
=
Achu ~ I see you sneezing!
I'm so sick.
Achu ~ I can see the shit out of you!
I have so many things to tell you when I see you!
Achu! Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo
The right concept to change the moment with EDM
This is creative!
It doesn't go very well with the black concept that I sang
=
Honestly, I can't understand why you were dressed like that.
It's Achu, it's all black. The song also cooks, and the secretion is hidden. Yeah I really don't know your mind
=
Isn't Baby Soul the leader? Not very noticeable on the team. I'm good at singing, but I don't see anything in my team meetings or anything like that.
=
If you change the concept here, you know, "I've changed your concept. It's pretty.
=
It looks like rotten fruit lol I put on some preservatives lol
=
Lord already? I don't know so much that my name is melancholy anyway.
=
Jin's mouth is unnatural
=
I can't miss this stage. Why can't you interpret your songs? Dealer's production skills fell; Real Seolhyun's expression = My facial expression What's the stage No inspiration lol Cool! It's pretty. I have to listen to these feelings, but I'm not oriented to other groups, so I can't feel any emotions. The American girl has a great mood and charisma. The child does not seem to match the real group color too much. . It seems like the appearance is not so good on the broadcasting camera, and the unity that was there every time this child came out? I can't immerse myself because the gap is so great that it disappears.
=
Why did you put one more baby sole on top? Alone, so it looks a bit weird in group shots ...
=
Are you naked after all? No, think about why the public liked Achu.
=
I can't hear you.
=
Do you think I'm not singing alone?
=
Lovelyz sings really well ^^ ~ ♥♥
=
2:43 Handsome
=
All the other groups show girl crush or cruelty, but I'm going to go to girl crush because I'm too bored to go to my concept of clean innocent. I was supposed to choreographed it.
=
It's better than six senses.
=
If you're just arranging ... you'll do the right thing.
=
I'm really curious but how did you pass the audition?
=
Girlfriend Oh My Girl This group is pure innocence
The songs aren't childish, but Lovelyz is a little trapped in this concept, so I feel like I'm releasing them with gestures or expressions.
=
Jackpot
=
This is the most shocking thing ever
=
Song lyrics remain the same
=
Oh, I don't know if my company is a problem or a singer, but the arrangement is right or not compared to other teams ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Wow ~ Lovely's Achu Invert ~ K-pop has two meanings since this performance.
=
Seung Heon is much better
=
I didn't really interpret the song. I feel like I want to do something nice in uniform. I'll keep watching it.
=
It's better to be a girl
=
What should I say about this? Japanese anime should just keep it as Japanese anime.
=
Cody: I ​​was really serious again
=
Why are children sixth place on this?
=
Members want to throw away innocence
=
Here's why I keep feeding B'Augal ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Veagirl filled the stage with 4 people, but they look so empty
=
Kay is always in that position every time the treble is closed. Close your eyes and raise one hand.
=
Park Bom ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Creepy with a creepy face ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's true .. Think of the other group covering the Achu and making a nasty expression with the third finger on the Achu. Wink while singing sixth sense;
=
3:38 unexpressed pack width
=
Lovelyz seems to think that the public wants to see their different faces.
The public just wants to see a great stage.
Whether it's an original concept or a different concept, the public who claps on a high-level stage keeps showing that they have this form.
=
I'm going to fight against the revolutionary army
I'm so excited about these girls. What's the concept of wearing a face and smiling?
=
2:59 This expression is d.
=
Zea's Pop: Feeling like the bomb is exploding
Kay's Pop: Crazy Arcade
=
Who did you do best here?
1. Still understanding the concept
2. Lee Mi-joo understands the concept
3. Introductory part of the Hangang
4. Zea eating at home
=
3:44 Jiho Nyaon is the cutest
=
Serge's over-immersed, but I understood the concept.
=
Like a child, it's like a child
=
3:46 Cat dog cute
=
It's so bad that it's so funny that I keep seeing it ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
4:41 Wink wasn't just Cay .. ☆
=
Rather than Kay Soul, Baby Soul vocals seem to go much better together ...
=
Kee and Jin Why do you not like this ... Serge Su-soo best suits makeup, facial expression, voice, etc
=
3:38 seconds stop and look at Miyeon
=
4:18 Kay, that's not it please.
=
Historical group that made a famous saying that there is a reason for the ruling stone, leaving a noble saying that it was made by fan service
=
Lee Joo-joo Seo So-soo Baby Soul These three don't even understand the concept and seem to be the best ...! Ryusu was good at the beginning, but wink at the back ... Kay ..... I can't think ... 4:18
=
I don't think it's too immersive, but it doesn't seem like it's too immersive because other kids don't interpret the song.
=
...? This beat Park and the kids?
=
Wow, this is a topic in a different sense
Views are really high
There are a lot of Korean comments and many words.
=
4:06 직 Intuitive face that we won ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
3:05 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅌㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'm scared.
=
Do you know why I miss you so much, and do you know Boombay from hell? I think it's this kind of thing.
=
Kay's pop is really missing Mac.
=
Queen's largest beneficiary
It is scheduled to come back, but it is summoning Totoga class
=
I'm just here to see the comments. It's so funny to say the comments once a week ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Lovelyz painted a big picture.
I couldn't do it
I keep seeing things whenever I get stressed strangely
Drug video
=
No less than half of B'Agal's singing power or ripple effect, and it's like a feast of jokers and clowns; If only Narsha is on stage
=
It's a point that Sixsex calls something like wrecking it.
=
It's too hard .. B-girl's songs are so hard that most idols don't cover them .. The voice was not covered by Lovelyz .. Rainbow A. These songs were appropriately charismatic and sexy. Selection is really easy
=
4:49 Hehe we won ^ ㅁ ^
=
3:04 Kinky Kitchen
=
I think you'll succeed if you do better than you want to do.
=
It may be better to have banana allergens like this
=
The chorus of pop chorus would have eaten less if he just drove it to Baby Soul ...
By the way, I skipped summoning this song highlight 3-stage dolphin.
Rap is a mess and only Su Ji Su seems to understand the concept correctly.
=
4:53 Park Bom is dancing, and this dance comes from the fires the girls played. Why?
=
Park Bo-young will show you sexy
It's like seeing them wearing quinceanera clothes.
=
3:46 Jiho is cute ...
=
These songs are less than the sneeze
=
I've come to see B-girl Six Synths to see how bad they are.
=
4:11 Why is this so: The kids are so funny that they keep coming in.
=
Lovelyz itself is a thin high-pitched tone, so it doesn't seem to match this girly concept
=
Here's the comments I keep feeding the B-girl girls ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
I will pretend ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
The biggest victim of all day: B-girl eating at home ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It seems that Apink's innocent concept changed from 1 to 1 because it was interpretable.
=
I keep hearing this song in this version
We squeeze in par ... pressure ♡
=
Beergirl: Paap!
Lovelyz: Pahab ~ ❤
=
What's the concept? Unreacted reaction in the middle is a real response
=
It's really going to be a history of black history. Do you have any scabies? I think I can digest enough in Soshi, Kara and Girl's Day songs. It's too bad.
=
4:47 sec Look at the face
=
Cody understood the concept best, but Cody was perfect. When you look at the stage, you dress men and soldiers almost like soldiers, and women and girls dress up like soldiers and boys, girls and boys.
=
This is more fun to see comments than the real video
=
It's a rare sight to see a selection of songs in a debut idol contest rather than a practice contest like Pewdu.
=
Mamamu look like we can't do this ...? This is it
=
3:46 Keep looking back ...
=
Oh, I really need to compliment the other guys. But when I don't speak, I look like this.
=
There is no member in Lovez who has such a powerful voice as BEAUGIRL and Zea, but I am so immersed in the concept that I missed the song.
=
This stage is a bit silly, so I keep coming.
=
It's a stage that proves how great Beagirl is.
=
* 6th place for kids *
=
Arrangement is a karaoke mr chonti ... There are also voices that do not go with the song at all ㅋㅋ
=
One secret garden closure, two pairs
=
I was upset and upset and embarrassed to manage my facial expressions. They cover each other, but only their songs can not be covered in the middle of the reaction. The hardest thing to do .. (The crew did not give notice in advance.
=
4:46 Hyejung: Gigacha Seolhyun: Oh my.
=
4:46 Hyejung: Eh ..
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋ
=
3:39 This is also an enemy expression ..?
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Arrangement is also a mischief .... There is no magnificence 1 ... I don't know what it's about Almost karaoke mr-level K solo song was good
Don't you baby baby soul
=
Why is Bae Yoon-jung so angry?
=
4:24 Did Vinnie go? .. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Is this the video that tells you to travel past
=
B-girl remake album release
Zea: I was worried about the remake. The remake has a clear comparison, so our lack is inevitable, so we have been careful and tried to understand it.
=
Originally, the live performance would be a bass or something like bass, but it's basically the reason why the beat is empty ....?
=
What is this ...? I didn't see the quantum, but suddenly I shook it up and it's a dog shock.
=
No, don't put it in the recommended video
I feel pitiful now
=
When I liked only Lovez, I thought 'I should mock this one, but I love all the Lovelyz songs, but I've done a lot of good work'. I think it would have been nice if we had a secret garden or a fifth season or a bungee.
Even though both groups were innocent, they had different feelings when they listened to the two groups, but it might have been better if they listened to Lovelyzner's than Oh .. what would it have been if Lovelyz did it after listening to all three songs? I want to hear Lovelyz do my best.
Regardless of the subject, there is a song that suddenly comes to mind.
=
Thank you so much for coming back. Have Abracadabra on your wall
=
Even if I look at K-pop caustic pops, it makes me laugh. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
When you arrange an accompaniment, you put a magnificent thing in the accompaniment.
=
2:59 This facial expression is so funny.
=
3:46 Nya
=
If Bae Yoon Jung reacts to this video, his views will explode.
=
3:39 Shu: Scared
=
00:14 As always, this fan is a big fan.
=
Why are they really winking and smiling?
=
3:39 I'm scared.
=
This is like that. Webtoon I just wanted to be a webtoon.
=
4:50 Snow Mind
..What is this?
=
There's no one in the voices of Lovelyz members that suits this song.
=
Yoo Ji-ae will get F even if she goes out
=
This concept is like a war, go out of war, lipstick, hand kiss, wink ... ;;
=
I think baby soul would like this pop
=
3:45 Meow% @ ~~~

If you look at the comment here, what's the problem and why? What kind of song would be better? What kind of expression is different? I know what the method is specially. Didn't you think?
=
2:14 Seunghee's reaction restaurant ~
=
Lovelyz Cameo and Moonlight Song
It's great, look at it
Don't talk
=
Think about it. Someone went to war, laughed, hand kissed and winked and fought.
=
You can criticize, but don't blame and ridicule any more.
=
It's a mistake to think of Six Sense as a sexy concept ...
=
What battlefield do you challenge for?
=
Baby Soul is the best
=
What's funny is that the reactions with the soul are all clumsy After seeing it ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Other people have little soulless reactions ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The only team that loses after coming out of the Queendom
=
Ah ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Is it true to come to see comments?
=
Paap !!!! There's no himari, no impact, no emotion ...
=
No Comments View Scary Real ;;
=
Really ... I don't want to hear it because the pop is so pretty ...
=
The lemon is so uselessly eaten ...
=
1:52 Jeon So-yeon feels like I understand something.
=
Representative of what happens when a singer doesn't understand a song
=
3:46 Jo Miyaong
=
Problem) There are not too many members but there are too many backup dancers.
Awkward look. Not suitable gestures (sonkiss, wink)
Paa Hop's impact. Suddenly three stages.
Lovelyz fans aren't fans with this concept, but because they're good at innocent and lovely concept, they like it. I don't think it's a girl's uniform but it's just a YouTube dance cover.
=
It's funny every time I see you
=
4:53 It's too late, but isn't Park Bom's reaction kids?
=
I can't really hear you singing.
=
Here's a hit number of people
=
Luplic fans are mistaken. The reason why this stage is so criticized is complex. Not one or two reasons.
(1) The other groups are thoroughly prepared, such as making rap parts not included in the original song, making new choreography, or arranging songs at a new level.
(2) Oh My Girl sings contest negatively from the concept conference in that the concept is the same. I got Benefit and changed the song, but this is my choice. No company opinion. Of
(3) The preparation period is given, but the stage is set up without even analyzing the music. Six Senses is not a sexy concept, but a song that should show intense charisma with a wild, powerful, liberation from society and resistance. But the rubbing hand kiss kiss kiss wink smile /
(4) The original song is very difficult among the girl group songs, and it is known as a legend among the legends, so it is hard to be flat even if you are good at it. Compared to the original song, all members cannot follow the power of the original song. Reading a rappart Korean book, awkward Narcissus part dictionaries, malt vocals, pahab ~ ㅇㅅ <to the best ... only one of the members does not reach the original level
Isn't this good? Why should I be so jealous? This stage Lub-Lee is a stage decorated with songs of his choice. Benefit can choose the song at will, and it's a privilege to write it.
=
The seasoning is not a seasoning.
=
3:05 LOL
=
High, wide, arm!
Hahahahahaha
=
0: 00 ~ 1: 19 You just have to watch
=
Ryu Soo-jeong's attempting to rip somehow feels like K's chasing after each piece
=
3:39 Scared without a soul
=
Real concept I got it wrong ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
If I didn't wink, I would have gone to the concept class.
=
What is it? Park Bom Reaction Kids
=
Understanding Suh Ji Soo's concept You've done it right by yourself But it's not excessive but it's awkward
=
This is addictive like Hellbaya
=
3:37 Mischievous expressionless haha
=
Take your strengths and fill in your weaknesses, but only think about your weaknesses.
Rather than being sexy, Red Velvet Pikabu, Violetta, Labian Rose, Girls' Generation Ryan Hart from that, mr mr.
=
I looked at the comments here and found out that the best geniuses in my country are not doctors or doctors.
=
K Paaap ~ In the spectacle 1:49 Wink kissed ㅋㅇ I wasn't interpreting the song at all ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I liked the comeback V-girl so much that I watched the video for 5 hours .. I kept talking about Queendom.
=
I'm going to kill this guy with an iron pipe. I'm going to kill you.
=
No, I've never heard of Six Senses, but I've heard a lot of things. What panther
If you're going to do a fan service, don't ruin the stage or don't ruin the stage at the contest. Fan service is going to be a good service. I'm going to listen to Abracabra.
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I don't go with Lovelyz ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Sergeant's face looks the best
=
Can you chew on the Queendom when you come out?
=
Why did you face it? I thought you were playing at Lotte World.
=
Kay look too burdensome
=
Babe: sexy taunt
Lovelyz: Pretend pretty
=
4:35 You're good at lip syncing.
=
I started out with Cain Peerna and watched the entire episode of Baargirl and sang Baargirl in Queendom.
=
It's a stage that shows that there's a reason why it's ruined ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Concept I don't have a child who understands it.
=
This is once a week ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ I'm seeing a new run baek ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ
=
3:37 Look at Miyeon's facial expression ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Yes..? What did I see now
=
If you hit the 'Pahab' Youtube, this video will be right. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's like a stage that shows how the concept that Lovelyz has held so far has been for Lovelyz ...
=
Ah every time I see K-pa ~ every time I press it, it explodes ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
If it wasn't just kei-pop,
=
I'd rather arrange it with your concept ... and it wouldn't have been the same as it is now ...
=
It's just funny ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ. LOL. Ha ha ha
=
Honestly, is this my money?
=
I don't blame you because I'm a person.-* It wasn't this. *
=
4:35 I'm surprised
=
I've watched Ryusujeong V app pool again but I don't really like it. I've done it for a while ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
4:47 lol
=
The rest is all messed up, so I can't help but understand the concept of bibliography alone ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Like other groups, you should have made your own style or contacted a song that suits your group's concept. It's been a long way even if you make a mistake.
=
??? : Are you going to do this?
=
Wow, this is 2 months ago and 2 months ago.
=
When I forget, I come to see it
=
I heard that the Six Senses original concept is a female warrior who resists the dictatorship. This is a person who is dragged and tortured (Cain), a man who is forced to lie falsely (Mi Ryu), and a political prisoner (Narsha), who is torn down instead of a deceased lover. Will not seem to be 1 degree. Let's look at the video making.
=
4:49 Here Seolhyun seems to be bitter and patient. This too will pass ...
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Wow ~ Mosita ~~
=
Many girl groups know that this song is a legend, but they know there's a reason why they can't touch it.
=
Brea Girl: What are you doing?
=
Honestly, I'm coming to comment
=
B-girl hangs my third finger on the table
=
I've heard today ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
If I was going to sing a bea girl, Sign or My Style. If I was going to be a galk concept, I would have to do something like Girls' Generation Catch me if you can or The boys. So overwhelming
=
But this video is a drug I keep coming in and see it
=
Lovelyz: Is it sexy or fatal?
Bear: If you don't want to keep an eye out
=
Ryu Soo-jung, Su Ji-soo, and Lee Mi-ju did not seem to express this song well.
=
But aren't they covering each other's songs? Why are you singing that song?
=
I'm shocked to see that you're really good at commenting.
=
LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL
=
The background is too empty when you listen to the original song.
=
I'm so powerless
=
This is really ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ. ㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Are you crazy? ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Papa's six senses come out really crazy ..... Papa ~
=
This is not a children's play house .... Why do you wink with the hand kisses? ... Why do you have a wound make-up besides this? I shouldn't be fourth.
=
4:27 Real soulless reaction
=
4:35
Lee Mangi ...?
=
First of all, I can't replace Zea's vocals.
=
This is why it's the fourth place without a squid. It's better to see Park Bom and the girls did better ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
3:40 Yep ..
=
This comment is more funny than it is lol
=
The main vocal sings and doesn't fit.
=
3:46 I love you hoon❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
If Lovelyz wants to show a new look, the first thing to do is to cut down the K highs. The K treble is characterized by a lovely song, but it's limited to express it. The expressions are always the same ... I think Ryu Sujeong is much better at expressing for a song. The rest of the members are fine, but Yoo Ae and Elite aren't serious.
=
Why is Six Sex?
=
Popular singers should never expose their weaknesses. Omgirl was acclaimed for highlighting their strengths. Worst choice miss. You can't touch a song like this.
=
When you touch your ears and explode treble, it's funny. The world is elegant.
=
Ah, I see you periodically
=
4:46 Look at me.
=
If you wander on YouTube for two to three years
=
Seungheonsu is better, guys.
=
Cody was the best at understanding this song.
=
I come every day, but every time I come, it's funny.
=
Cain Narsha's dolphin can't follow
It's not something anyone can follow, but they were really hard
=
I can see why Lovelyz can't make it. They're just looking pretty no matter what the song is.
=
Beargirl's sisters' voices are powerful and powerful, but they're just like mosquitoes.
=
Paap ~ ♡ Paap ~ ♡ Paap ~ ♡
=
I start my day with a smile while watching this video
Wow ~ ❤️ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
~~
I feel like it's leaking from a perforated balloon
=
I didn't want to see much, but the new comments are so funny that I come to see them
=
It's been a while since PLS
=
Melodies and voices don't go with me.
=
04:18 Treble Explosion
=
Best choice miss this year
=
It beat Park Bom ㅋㅋㅋ I watched the stage of the Park Bom and I didn't feel like singing children's songs
=
It's like an air-wave ~ hap ~
=
2:38 Look at the face ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This was my face when I looked after me
=
It's true that Lovelyz doesn't have a better stage than I thought because I misinterpreted the song. I tried to change the image and it didn't work out and I can do better next time ...
=
I think I'd be upset by my girl.
I was so upset about you covering each other's songs
Can't see my song cover ......
=
4:54 Park Bom Fire Fire
Are you ...!?!?
=
Break, break, ...
=
Like Seung Hun Sung sings much better ...
=
Excuse me to the original singer, Beagirl, and to my Oh My Girl ...
=
4:55 Why do you put the reactions you gave your children here?
=
Wow .. It's the first time I've seen this stage. It's like an anti-horsepower test.
=
1:28 If you look at the original song, it feels like it's pahanging.
=
I think Ryu Sujeong is better here, and, in the beginning, this song is not a song that laughs and laughs; Kee laughs, but for fans, I don't laugh when I look at the original songs and I'm honestly looking forward to it. I'm sorry for Vea Girl.
At the same time, Ryu Soo-jeong feels like, Kay is serious about ;;; And Park Bom's reaction doesn't seem to be true. Something is a reaction to your retreat. ;;; I feel Papa Why did you give it to Kay ?; And this song was sexy, not the main, but it was a girl
=
I just use a few winks.
=
I know you're good at not giving high scores.
=
Pop! Pop! I have to pop it when I'm going to break it ~ I'm sorry
=
3:46 Miyaon
=
The kids are good, but the genre is not right
If I had done something like the world I met again,
=
It's so funny that I get addicted.
=
Contest Lost Specialist Idol Lovelyz
Three consecutive defeats in Sugarman
=
If Lovelyz is to develop further, train your members to start practicing their facial expressions. I'm serious. I've always made a smile on a cute song, but if you see Oh My Girl, your hand gestures will always add to the color of the song. If you are an idol, you have to act on stage
=
4:55 What's this feeling like coming out of a fire?
=
I love you ~
=
00:50 seconds What is this? ♥ ~
=
3:05 Phoab! I love this part too ♡
=
This is the end of K-song's singing doldol image.
=
But it's cute
=
03:45 The match is big
=
4:25
Oh ... it's creepy ...
It was a double track ...
=
Really screwed up ... This didn't interpret at all.
=
I'm seeing a lot of Korean comments on Mnet Channel for the first time almost lol. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
5 minute video summary: Paap ~ ♥
=
4:36 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
3:39 You can sum up the Lovelyz stage with a look
=
I feel like I can't find my own color among the six teams ... The other team is trying to take the song and interpret it as my own feeling. Mebo, which is important to the atmosphere of the song, doesn't mix with the vocals.
=
Like the original song can not follow ,,,,,, but there are a lot of comments
=
It's like kids fire reaction at 4:54.
=
It sounds like you're attacking treble when you treble k
=
4:10 I felt something like this ... I'm feeling two generations of the legendary Boombaya. I'm forced to summon Erie Minami. I'm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8W7hs95hYI
Legendary Performance Produce 48 Hellbaya Group 2
=
Six Senses is not a sexy concept, but wild beauty.
=
Yes. In fact, Lovelyz was going to put up B-girl.
=
LOL
=
When you pop, you have to burst into trueness .. It's a vocal.
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ So, why are you picking a song for a girl so why not ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The reactions I'm seeing are reacting to me because I have no soul. It's funnier.
=
4:49 Laughing
=
At first, it was okay to watch the broadcast, but I did it. Why did you look at the original song of B-Age ... Why do you do this? Rap doesn't understand the concept. ;; Looking back, the kids look bad ...
=
Give the kids some food. Keep eating rice.
=
No people look ㅋㅋ ㅅㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
This is fourth and the children are sixth? It's really ridiculous
=
LOL
=
The number of bibliography is the hardest, but why is there no compliment?
=
It's a bit ...
=
Soyeon Reaction: 1:52
=
Ambassador crazy?
=
Ha ... it's a video of a devil.
=
Are you tired of K-pop?
=
This is k-pop ♡
=
I'm thinking about it again
Rather, just add the original song without adding anything
If you add, you are a bath double
=
Ah, I'm really smiling at the high-pitched mines LOL LOL
=
Every time I see other stages, Mimi's face is really cute.
=
I'm sorry for Lovelyz, but when I watch this video, I mute and see only comments ...
=
I come to see you whenever I'm bored.
=
I can't sing Six Sense among Lovelyz kids.
=
Yoo Ae-Thu-Mar-Nh-Ye-Eul-Yul-Yen Sweat-Bang-Ul-Y-Gul-Hee-Go↘️
=
Don't rap with Yuji;
=
But I was surprised that Ryu Soojung was similar to Cain voice.
=
I'm scared of Shuhwa ㅋㅎㅋㅎ ㅋㅎㅋㅎ ㅌㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㅌ ㅌㅌㅌㅌ
Jiho Miyaon
I keep watching to see the movieless reactions. ㅠㅠㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Are you treble? Lol
=
It's been a big victory since the pop measure
=
걍 We always had the concept of a pretty song but we also want to do sexy girls. I want to show anti-war charm. But you have to look pretty and cute on the camera. This feeling. It's not going to be a girl's song if you sing a high-pitched song and put on a uniform.
=
I've lip synced, so if you're going to live ...
=
3 million of the 5 million views here come to comment
=
What is the alternative bibliography Ryu Soo Jung? When I approved it, it was this one lol
=
If you want to have a uniform concept, tell me your wish.
=
This song shouldn't be pretty, but I think it's a problem for me to be pretty. In the beginning, this song itself is a revolutionary, war concept. Just looks better on
=
Original song: Paap ...! Paap ...! (Power)
Lovelyz: Papa ~ ❤Papa ~ ❤ (Cute ...)
=
Oh real algorithm why you? I will stop now !!!!
(???): Their skills also recognized algorithms. Keep looking at you too
=
Who's the song?
=
Beagirl feels strong and heavy from the beginning, but Lovelyz is so light ..
=
I should have touched something ... I'm going to sing this song, and I don't have powerful vocals. You have to call someone with the feeling that you'll just get caught by someone. They're busy winking, singing and laughing.
But even if some are better, each one has different interpretations, but I don't know which beat
And Zebal 쫌 this yellow dolphin treble is a pointe. I heard you call it here an octave lower. I wanted to know what it was.
Besides, do you eat wasabi in a caustic way? In the most important part, you don't have a good amount of sound.
And it's a good way to show them what they're good at, but I don't know why I keep sticking to a different concept. I don't like it, so I'm swearing. I'm going to prepare for the next stage and talk to each other about the interpretation of the song. I wish I had a better stage
For Sixties, Six Senses wasn't real ... it's not sexy, it's a charismatic girl crush warrior.
=
ㅋㅋㅋ Really ... Bah was filled with four people and couldn't fill the voices.
=
I need to distinguish criticism from criticism.
=
4:54? Spring sister what are you doing there?
=
2:59 Similarity to Songan
=
Oh My Girl, Children's Rice Cake

Lee Myung Bak ^ 3 ^
=
This song should be called to bite the audience what ;;; Winking, biting my lips ... pretending to be pretty
=
Seungheon was doing well.
=
Are you the only one who is addictive?
=
I think it's not bad to be a space girl la la love ...
=
I finally watched this stage .... I don't know much about singers.
=
I watched B-girl in the subtype and remembered that this video came up together after watching B-girl's music video. I got a good video thanks to YouTube's algorithm. When you feel bad, you should come and see once.
=
The only thing they don't sing is Oh My Girl.
=
I listened to the original song and listened to the level difference.
=
I'm sorry for not dolphin.
=
And Paap ~ ♥ made me travel a lot of memories ...
=
Honestly, I came to see your comments 댓글 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Replying to @Breakfast
=
3:38 Surprising rainy season
=
❤❤
=
3:45 Jiho meow
=
Park Bom was like that.
It's like she doesn't know her strengths
My face looking at this stage now
=
Like the vocaloid revolution ... it's amazing
=
3:33 seconds
=
My masterpiece !!!!! Ahhh! Don't ruin ... ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Too sad to be honest, when everyone sings their own song without being able to interpret the song, Su Ji Su is throwing away all the original gestures and focusing on the expression as much as possible.
=
4:53 Park Bom That dance is not a fire dance?
=
Ryu Soo Jung
=
If there were only 8 members, the closure would have gotten well together.
=
Arranged too much
=
It's a pity that Six Sense, which lacks power and dolphin, only wanted to try Six Sense.
Feeling not knowing their strengths. Park Bom hit the real bones hard. Do what they are good at.
It's not just getting off because it's a lovely situation right now.
Suddenly, survival came out and the concept was broken.
=
Still, I think I'm a little better
I think you two did well
=
Looking back on the stage of the song selection process ... The members who had a positive opinion before receiving the free selection Benefit go well with this song, and the negative members seem to understand the concept. The other members gathered, but the picture failed to unite.
=
I think it's a girl crush if you give your eyes strength.
=
Honestly, 2 million out of 329 million views seemed to come to comment
=
1:09 Solar expression: You can't?
=
I come to see this once a day ㄱㅇㄱ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Ah I can hear anything else but I can't hear it from pa-ap ~ ★ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:03 This is scary
=
This string brass, vocal, and full song made the arrangement so empty, but the vocals are empty ...
=
4:54 Park Bom Reaction kids fire Stage 2:05
=
1:00 I had to turn off the TV only after seeing this far ..... expectation grew like crazy and then went down in 3 bars ..
=
Baby Soul Is there a member right ???
=
Hugh ... It's the first time I've been watching a song since I've been ...
퍄햡
=
All that Lovelyz did well was to pull up a B-girl to come back soon.
=
zz, it's still hot.
=
2:24 Dunke
Not fatal
=
I know what the concept Lovelyz wants to show
I'd rather have Oh My Girl fireworks, and the result would have been better
=
4:15 In my personal opinion, Lazy is ... the group itself is an innocent concept and ...
The facial expressions become habitual ... I think that pose comes out ... regardless of what the concept is ...
I don't think he's understanding the concept ...
3:33 If you look at it ...
Six Senses is not a sexy concept ... Charismatic Ozzie is a female warrior ... Jiyeon still has a hand kiss and laughs 4:17 Hand gestures, I don't understand why pop was so called.
=
Sexy looks good on you.
=
But I know that it's not a concept song, but I can understand the song.
=
Now this article can come in even if you search for "Pahab"
=
Fact) Yoo Ji-ae, who is cursed like a baby, is two years older than Hwahwa
=
Is this a nice video with shit and it's a pleasure to laugh while watching other girls react?
=
Really funny
=
I get addicted and come to hear once a day
I don't understand, but I'm still listening
=
Bae Yoonjung: Oh. Turn off the camera.
=
But the Americas are really pretty.
=
Isn't it the same age as that time?
Why are you like babies?
=
For some reason, I think Lovelyz is good just like Lovelyz
=
Editing is also wrong ㅋㅋ
=
I think it's better than Lim Jaebum calling bubble pop
=
Lovely's Six Sense ......? If you feel like this
Be Girl's Six Senses .....? !!! I feel like this.
=
Baby Soul's Voice
=
Um ... ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm going to listen to the powerful and strong original song.
=
This song should have a spleen like a warrior going out to battle, not a gall in the first place. I only thought about it without thinking, and I didn't respect the cost of the singer.
=
Why do I come to see this? ..?. ?? ㅋ ㅎㅋㅎㅋ ㅎㅎㅋㅋ
=
I find it strange, but every time I see something, it tastes good.
=
If the first thing you've seen is a mistake
=
.... What the ... No. Why do you wink when you sing this song?
=
It's a pity to find out why you are in a pure concept only. Rather, they don't know that they are the best and that the public wants from Lovelyz.
=
No, it's so ill, but the comments are so funny that you'll come back to it. Lol. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
=
I don't think anyone understands the concept except for one or two ... Put some cuteness and cuteness in this song ...
=
I'm not good at bibliography though
=
Why did you come around here?
=
All the other children have arranged their own feelings and change their choreography. Lovelyz is not just a lovely style, but a feeling of bringing the concept of a baby girl.
=
It's on top even if I crush it
=
Addictive and good to hear
=
Touching the sleeping nose
=
Six Senses Billboard Ranked 22nd Best K-pop in 2010! Thank You Lovelyz
=
Lovelyz is out of Queendom and lost more.
=
Senior!
You turned the stage upside down!
You showed the hybrids properly!
=
I just want some pop part.
=
Sunglasses can be seen.
=
Um, this song is not so quiet.
=
Park Bom would have been the same generation as the original song lol
=
After seeing this, Beyoncé Celinedion Jessie Jay lived up to 2 hours after finding Maum's peace.
=
Paap ~
=
Hyejeong is better.
=
The agency is worse ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Normally before going to the stage, I have to check with the person in charge of the company (representative, choreographer, vocal coaching, large manager, etc.)
This is just ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Even if it's a lip-sync, let's pretend it's hard when you tremble ... how to react to this ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Paap ~ ♡
=
When I searched for Six Sense on YouTube, I was surprised to see this video appearing in the eighth
=
When it's crazy, all the pops are on rice
=
Come and see Seung Hun Six Six Sense
=
There's a camera and everyone should have a good response because there's a camera, but the facial expression is ㅇㅁㅇ What is this expression ... ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ

I'm cheering for Lovelyz that Yunsang made it because I like Yoonsang .... Lovelyz, it's not this ... To reinterpret the song, at least the correct interpretation of the original song is first ...
=
Aesop's Lovelyz changed to a concept similar to Oh My Girl, but it's better to sing Oh My Girl. Oh My Girl was a lovely drama song.
=
K's voice is a bit thin
=
Definitely there is a difference in quantity
=
It's interesting that the other groups have all been cakes since Queendom.
If you watch the video, all the comments below are about Queendom
=
I was so good, but the original song was so bad. Lovelyz is cute.
=
........ K-pop that loses its power ....
=
People who come to see me whenever I'm depressed
Level ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ That's why life is so poor
=
K seems to have the lowest understanding of this song even though he is the main vocal. I didn't know the taste of this song, I didn't know how to sing it,
=
K popped
=
I was speaking Russian at 1:40 ...
=
But the sixth sense is like the original song
=
No, but this is a drug video lol
=
Now the Queendom is over, but I want season 2 to come.
=
I just want to be sexy and look pretty
=
Lol
=
Kpart pop here so prettily
Yes; In choreographing forcefully
Like that
=
Why Lovelyz swear on this stage
1. Incorrect interpretation of songs
2. There was no time was a show for fans, etc. Excuse only dam
3. I don't accept feedback and say, "I don't know.
4. Pahab ~ ♡
=
Seo Ji-soo is cool.
=
The point is that the melody is magnificent.
=
It's not ...
=
I'm listening to my treble, but I can't feel anything cool.
=
I realized by watching the video a few times ... Oh my girl.
I didn't think it was because it was a broadcast, but I was expecting my cover to be covered.
If you are notified that you don't have your own music on the day, you can't say anything more than Menbung.
Anyone who doesn't mind is the most enthusiastic yard and the best reactions and applause. Insung 甲 What?
I listen to Lovelyz songs a lot but I'm so disappointed.
=
I'm seeing B-girl Six Sense. I've seen this in the comments so I know why.
=
The only thing that says ...
=
Is this a Baab restaurant?
=
I need to hear Zea's pop.
=
No matter how much you think about it, the number of surges jumps less.
=
Tow's stop 4:13
=
Ryu Soo Jung I love you so much
=
The number of surges is the best
=
If you listen closely, the arrangement is wrong. The song is too slow and too tempo
=
Youtube keeps running with Lovelyz publicly ㅅㅂ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ If you see this, let me see the original song and rotate the original song and recommend it again ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ

Me: ah ;;;
=
Are you addicted to pop?
=
The intro was good. Yes.
=
I just don't know that it's the best choice to just sing Oh My Girl
=
I'm grateful to Lovelyz for giving me so much talk that I learned this song.
=
If you forget, it makes a video ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
04:26 sec Park Bom As much as Park Mi Kyung. I think I was thinking of corn as a bag
=
B'Agirl Dolphin Part is a legend
=
This stage is very satisfying expression as if it is the stage which only oneself is satisfied with.
=
It's still hot
=
I don't like the intro part
=
Good for 40 seconds
=
In the pop part, Kay should go to Jinseong instead of being caustic. Suddenly, he gets tired of highlights. Baby Soul pops first and shouts
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
There's a possibility of a gourmet comment
=
LOL
=
Cain's introductory part is important, but he's out of the violent and overwhelming part of the introduction.

What kind of song does Kay sing like a moonlight angel? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

My cousin brother listens to this and crushes ~~ !! Because of this, Colpahab from the side ~~! Coppa Hop !! Like this
=
It's a different level than other stages
=
Seunghyun's can be covered by yourself
=
It looks like you're overly excessive, but that 's the original concept. It's normal to do it like Won-ran, but it seems burdensome for other members to interpret the song. Is it the arrangement? I don't know except the front part ... ???
=
Why the next video I see is a can of rain

Thank you Lovelyz.

It's not a clever choice ... I still don't have enough skills, but I've chosen the end plate of the image they want with a bunch ... I missed it all the time I saw this concept. I know what you want to do and why .... ㅠㅠ

Are you laughing at other singers?

In Lovelyz, Kay sings well, but if there's no Mac ...

I don't even know the singer 1, but it's obvious that the pop is too weak,

But thanks to you, people found out that B-girl was a talent,

=
There are only three members who can be galk, and if you do, you have to change the window method. You have to sing it powerfully.
=
Seungheon Tsugo and sisters ✋
=
There are so many back dancers and there are more members than V-girl but the stage looks empty.
=
Shuhwarang rainy season cuteness
=
I was personally good
ㅠ. ㅜ ㅡ
=
There was no respect for Oh My Girl
If you are going to bet on a selection,
I can't dance without an arrangement
It has all the good conditions for swearing.
I don't know why they don't show their characters as they say.
Mamamu, we're contesting with the kids
Girl, why are you risking your life?
Think about it, Mamamu, children.
Think of them wearing school uniforms
I am reckless as I am poor at qualification.
=
I want to see what Mamamu did.
=
It's like trying to make the hidden melody line stand out more than the overall stage atmosphere. Obviously, the tone sounds better than the original, and bounces.
There is a story that impact is lower than original song, but I
The composition of the stage and the intention and effort to align the movement with the original song seemed to stand out more.
=
Seung Hun Song sings better
=
The next popular article led me here
=
We really did not play with the sound of our children.
=
It's not that I didn't do this.
=
Why do you pretend to be pretty while you sing?
=
I don't hate Lovelyz, but I can't sing too much.
=
Wouldn't it have been better to sing a girl's song?
=
Now come to see this too
=
Seo Ji Soo I understand well ,.
I became a squirming girl because of the other kids.
=
Meow 3:45
=
Thanks to you, I'm going to cruise to B-girl. The times are changing, but thank you for making me remember again that the music industry was rich at that time.
=
I know what Lovelyz wants to show, but I'm trying to show too intense appearance without intermediate steps, so it seems that the first and second cars are awkward and there's no impact on the stage. I hope you're doing well ... America's best suited
=
Only people who listen to the original song can listen to it
=
It's like nursery rhyme
=
Lovelyz I never know that I'm not good at this group.
=
Pop part sounds too much
=
I've lost my Lovelyz identity.
It's crazy. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
I'd like to arrange a little arrangement, but not Lovelyz Achu. I don't know. Oh my girl seems to be getting more and more.
=
Park: Oh, I'll do this later
=
Dog, poop.
=
The Queen's winning team is Beagirl?
=
I saw you again ~~~ ^^ *
=
Thanks to you, I'm sure you want to get out of the innocence concept, but you should have found a song that suits you to some degree.
=
1:35 Now I heard that uh uh ~~ it's funny just me ..?
=
Love Live
=
The arrangement is apocalypse and it feels good but everyone's voice is so thin that it feels like they're floating. It's a different case than what you like.
=
If the members' voices don't match the song, I think it's a good idea to give a lot of parts to the members who don't think about the position. Lack of feeling
=
It's not enough to be good at the first time.
=
Man, they really need a sexy / dark concept ㅠㅠ Woolim do you see this ?! Please let them!
=
Six senses of the original song is animal kingdom grade
This is just an animal farm
=
즈 Lovelyz I didn't feel any problem that I felt on the stage
Baby Soul jin is good at singing, but he didn't use vocals and pushed Cayman's shoes.
=
Looks like it's not going with Lovelyz voice tone
=
Comments are choked
=
Ryu Soo-jung, Baby Soul, Already did well
=
When I pop, my voice is so thin
=
It seems like I've misinterpreted the original song.
I'd rather have given it to Huxol.
=
I recommend this because I can see it ...
=
Su Ji-soo, Lee Mi-joo Ryu Soo-jeong is surprisingly (even though it is very different from the original Lovelyz concept). 쎈 Make-up looks good. Just because the tone itself is thin and girly, the dark make-up doesn't suit each member. I think these two reasons are the biggest reason why they seem compared to the original stage. There may be some parts of the lack of interpretation .. But I don't think I'm going to swear at this .. ㅠㅠ Lovelyz Fighting !!!
=
It was a stage where I just knew why Lovelyz didn't make up. Members didn't know their color at all.
=
It's so thin that I'm listening to it while I'm listening to it, but it doesn't seem to be broken.
I think it's better to keep the youth concept right and don't like girl or girl.
=
It's too hard to pop
=
Americas survived ㅎㅎ ;;
=
Calling Six Senses like that ;;; Disappointment..
=
It's a shame .. I think I've tried to understand the concept and try to do it well, but I can't see it because it's awkward and anti-magical.
=
Seungheonsu is better ...
=
As you can understand the song best.
Please give me a lead on this song.
=
I'm sorry for not having power.
=
In the meantime, live was straight and laugh point
=
The company won't let you have a reason.
=
I came to see the cameo, but you are most lyrical.
=
It's the first to come out
From now on, the search box will display "Queendom Lovelyz Paab ~ ♥ Paap ~ ♥"
You don't have to say "K Sonkis". very good!
=
Wow ... you may not be able to do that
=
The stage is falling apart, but it's not fun and the vocals are particularly bad
=
Are you good at singing baby soul?
=
En ... ㅋㅋㅋ Honestly, the comments here are getting a bit of water.
=
* Beagirl's sisters weren't kidding, but did they feel like that?
=
I will do better than this
=
What's the search for moving images
=
It just doesn't go with Lovelyz and paap !! I feel like this part is too blurry ... I have to squeeze it hard like Zea ... and I feel sorry for the fact that the Nissal point is formed and this part has no angular feeling ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Baby Soul vocals have real power
=
Well, I didn't want to win a song or concept because I wanted to. It was a pity that the difference between what I wanted to do and what I could do was felt.
=
You should see what Seung Hun covers. Cain-Narsha Treble Part Better than These
=
Even if you call the forest hunpapa rappapa better than this
=
It's a V app or a fan service stage in Labang, and fans say it's fun.
=
1 person to see comments
=
There are some kids who don't even have a good tone, and the wink wink combo is just a concept that doesn't fit.
=
I like Lovelyz but it's not Six Sense.
=
Citation Count? He is the best
=
Donnum seems too much to blame
I'm upset.
=
It would be better if Mamamu covered Six Senses ...
=
Park Bom feels like a good senior who compliments juniors, and AoA is a real reality reaction
=
Convert the bad guys ^^
=
The song is so bad
=
Some of the members have interpreted the song, and how much did they do? It's not important, but it's the end of the story that it's a Lovelyz skill ... Didn't you practice while watching the original song stage in practice? ..
=
There's a lot of members, so every time I change people, I think it's a total difficulty.
=
In fact, when I first saw it, I thought it was too much and it was too much, but when I watched the stage, I saw that it was strange because I only understood the song alone ....
=
But I keep coming to see this
=
I just saw BeA Girl Six Sense, but I can't help singing Lovelyz.
=
One of the lovely ones is Baby Soul. Others are mosquitoes.
=
I don't know this rainy season, but I pretend to know
=
Here is a comment
"This show is a disaster."
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I like this
=
I don't think that Seo Ji-soo and Baby Soul interpreted the song.
=
This is over 5 million
=
Professional spirit to go hand in hand even in war
=
But don't blame them for themselves ... they shouldn't have done it well ... they're so mocked and so sick.
=
Take Codyman's salary.
=
I can only hear you at first.
=
Hey guys, wouldn't it be nice if they covered Six Senses?
=
It's the stage most resonating with the comment that I don't know why. This program is poison
=
Seungheon is better
=
Ah, are most of the performances on these programs lip-synced?
=
Catastrophe
=
I think it's a little solar expression. Now, please return the sixth sense I knew.
=
Some members can't pretend to be pretty ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ If you hold each other together, how would you protect the concept? If so, why did you want to do the girl crush sexy cup?
=
If you look at the comments and fixed ~
=
Ugh .... There are many meanings and meanings put on it, but it's a very sad stage because it seems like I've only seen the concept and performance .... And it's a difference between mediocrity and experience, but power, force, sexy and vocals. Even the girl is so over .....
=
you are good?
=
Six Senses itself is hard to do
=
He acted so frivolously to Oh My Girl and the stage is low, so he seems to be cursed ... Even if he didn't act like Oh My Girl, he didn't swear so much
=
Boyfriend Mr. Park Seong-su
=
Six Senses is a dolphin torture .. I'm sorry to hear that because of Lovely Sixs, how good is it to cover. What is this? What is this? On this good day What is this?
=
This is just a high view of Lovelyz Queen's video because they came to see what people didn't
=
In public opinion, Lovez would have been better at pushing Ohmy with songs, whether killed or boiled, but the only thing he showed on this stage was his low self-esteem and failed image change.
=
I didn't really interpret the song when I told you to cover it. What revolutionary group did you interpret? And somehow free .. I fight against freedom but wink wink and laughter wink
=
I have to squeeze treble ...
=
And Seolhyun have four more teeth than me
=
1:48 You're in danger, you're dying, but you're done with the sonkiss ...
=
Only me lip sync Tina
=
I think it's addictive. I came to see you again.
=
Is it driving a song or is the concept not right?
=
It's not that the number of surges is over, but that's right, but the other members call it so pretty. It seems that Jisoo is awkward from the start.
=
It's not like you're in the teen with a solar mouth.
=
Looks like it's just addicted.
=
Honestly, it was a mistake that Lovelyz made this song through trial and error, and I was a fan, but I felt it was a mistake, and I was upset.
Lovelyz sweared a lot
I felt like I'm so shy. If you're a lovely person, you'd give up. Where is this? Just think about it before you comment. Strangely after this cameo moonlight was good, but I'm not good at it. It's not really good to judge Lovelyz by watching this video and black art.
It's been a few days and you're blamed and cheap to swim. What's the difference with the bad guys?
=
It is cool to give already
=
The song is very good .. The original song was so powerful and wonderful that the slightly poor vocals on the cover were a bit unfortunate ... pop or voice ㅠㅠ lack of strength, no other arrangements, and the cover had something new, but there was no difference from the original song ...
=
I know you're here because I don't believe it's a mess.
Compared to these guys, B-girl was a mess
As Korea is following the Japanese idol
For reference, idols are not treated as singers in Japan.
=
It looks like Seung Heon covers better. Well, someone hurt her face and wink ..? I would rather have a uniform concept during the Girls' Generation song.
=
Mamamu is perfect!
=
If it's about Mama, can't you afford it?
=
The other Queendom groups are full of praise in the comments, but Lovelyz is swearing all the time, and they're showing off their professional appearances, especially aoa and Oh My Girl.
Lovelyz would have been better off falling to sixth place twice.
=
The original song is better because my voice is thin
=
Q: Choose the best of these.
1. Be A Girl who was preparing for comeback
2. Don't understand the Americas
3. The best bibliography after the Americas
4. Bae Yoon Jung
=
This is
=
Im Jae-bum will be better than bubble pop
=
No, why are you calling me that song?
=
I'd rather be okay if Mamamu did this
=
Doesn't it suit me?
=
And Lovelyz seniors, you turned the stage upside down. Beats, Rhythms, Souls, Just Lovelyz.
=
Oh, I'm not good at singing. You can change songs. I'm working in that industry.
=
Thin
=
I'd rather go to Namjang with a slower tempo. I'm sorry for the interpretation of the song.
=
It's more than Seung Hun Thix Sense than Bea Girl.
=
Ah..
=
It's not a sexy cuty song, but it's a song that expresses the intensity of war warriors in particular. ㅠ Bea girl can grasp it ㅠ And I don't understand most of the song, I don't understand most of the expressions, smoke, gestures, parts ~~
=
I love you already
=
Ha Ji-ae's first rap is going crazy.
=
I'd have done a great job
=
Inners live ears;
=
No ㅋ ㄷㄱㄷ ㄱㅌ ㄱㄷㄱ ㄷㄱㄷㄱ
Kids Reaction Only funny? I'm complimenting, but I can't manage my expression
=
It's the first time I've seen it so much
=
No match.
=
America, how about solo?
=
I'm a current idol ... This was a stage that's too negative for them and why is this gesture awkward?
=
It's more fun to watch comments than to watch the video lol.
=
The costume performances are all right, but the vocals were more like a bibliographic number.
Tao seems to be too swearing
=
I'm so sorry, I loved it a lot since my debut in Lovelyz ..... ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Now it's funny even with Jeonju only ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No, Kay's in trouble. Kay can't pretend he's so pretty. This is really Kay damn it all
=
I'm not a Lovelyz fan. The best suited innocence concept is that I'm hungry in the beginning and it doesn't work like this.
=
0:43 1:51 1:57 2:04 2:15 2:47 2:59 3:53 4:04 4:28 4:48 He couldn't hide his face.
=
I listened to the beauty part while listening to the rap part already
=
This is my imagination, but I didn't want to do Six Sense. If the comment is problematic, we will remove it.
=
I know what you want to do, but if it's really this way, they'll just stop at the existing Lovelyz. I'm not sure why the new changes are only sexy. I'm not sure why I keep pushing them.
Six Sense is a song with a really good vocal talent and a beautiful rap point. I don't know if they're pushing the sexy concept or if they're letting them go.
=
Barrel Dandelup Motion Not sure if this is anything else?
=
Honestly, it would be nice if Seung Hun S Six Sense was better than Lovely Six Sense.
=
I'm used to seeing the 7th stage, so it looks like a stage ??? It's all good except wink hand kiss
=
According to her interview, Six Sense was fighting against brilliant accompaniment and baby girl vocals because she was depressed by accompaniment when she went to record.
=
???????? Wow ㅎㅎㅎ
=
Towing is steering ...
=
Pa ~ hop ❤️
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I hope Mamamu will do it.
=
I think Park Bom and children are much better than this stage, but this stage is fourth.
=
Each expression is different and overall flat
I don't think I understand the song, and it's not too much to cover Six Sense.
The song is like Kangganggang River in general, but the chorus must be blown in the middle of it
The original song is simple sexy, resists against absurdity rather than girly, and it causes such a wound and it feels like that. Girl? I think it's a feeling, but since it's completely different from the identity of the song, I have to fill the stage with vocals, expressions, and feelings because I don't have a song, an expression, a choreographer, or a choreographer.
This stage is so bad
=
How many people are lip-syncing?
=
Ryu Soojung was the best and I thought it would be fine to do it until the elite imju, but it's a pity and Jin just lacks the clip and Baby Soul doesn't seem to have one. I always feel the index, but everything is unnatural.
=
I want to say as I feel, but I don't want to see because there are so many comments that beat me .....
=
4:47 aoa facial expressions = our facial expressions
=
The guy who came to watch the story of Lovelyz
=
Even though people say this, thanks to people, I got so many views. In fact, I come to listen regularly.
=
The voices didn't understand the song properly.
=
No, K. Paap is so funny.
=
No ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
You look so innocent
=
Turn off after 1 minute
1. What's the opera?
2.Concept of Six Sense of Concept
3.like voices
4. Make-up is also a problem, and I'm struggling to come out in front of the camera.
=
Stylist Babe Aigo Codyman's trouble
=
Woo Wook
=
Kay, you're like a fairy of love, not a champion of justice.
=
It's like Cain's wave.
=
They can try and fail. They're mocking ... They've been pure and they know they're not right now.
=
No, it's a lovely song, but it's because they've chosen a sixth sense that doesn't match their concept. It's not a refreshing song.
=
Total trouble ... Great party party ... But Cody's ... Cody only.
I'm looking forward to Lovelyz's closures. Why are you doing that?
=
Seungheon bring me
=
Surge count seems to be better
=
Except for the bibliography Ryu Sujeong
Papa ~ It's really bad because I feel bad
=
Who did it? When you do what you do best, it's the sexiest deal. It's not sexy to wear sexy clothes, make sexy expressions, and sing sexy songs.
=
At first, I was stunned by the critics
Now I have a lot of interesting comments, so I'll be funny. ㅋㅋ Now, the stage is a lot of beautification.
Luckily, it's good to be a stage where you can learn a lot from the stage rather than the stage where you will be hurt.
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ .... No. I haven't seen Queendom, but every time I turn the video as a B-girl comeback commemoration, Lovelyz shot it in the comments. Lol
=
But why can't you manage Baby Soul? I think I was the slimmer at the beginning of my debut
=
The other groups made sure their colors were not too out of sync with the original song. But even though this is the same color as that of B-girl and the powerful Mamamu, even if the cover is comparable, even if the voice is thin on the board, the wink will fly and just follow the B-girl, so it looks like this .. It is frustrating and frustrating and frustrating for the original song fans. .. People all say that Su Ji-soo is overlooked, but Su Ji-soo is good at interpreting the songs here.
=
What am I listening to now ?? Ha ...
=
Who's the palomi from 3:53
=
Can you win this stage even if you have Flame Charisma Minho covered?
=
But everyone seems to be an idol
If you look at the video analysis of six senses, it's not so bright, but does it make sense to smile like that?
=
It's not a crystal, but it's a big rapper, so it's only four people.
=
I know you can't do Lovelyz, why ... Oh
=
No views
=
If they had popped it, they would have eaten less ...
=
Ryu Soo Jung's voice is good
=
Lovelyz has a negative attitude towards Oh My Girl
But oh my girl who showed the biggest response to Lovelyz stage ...
Honestly, I feel sorry for everyone, but I thought everyone was too good. It's bad enough, but I'm glad I won first because of my ability.
=
Baby Metal Boy Feels
=
What the hell are you doing here? I'm curious.
=
Seung Hun's Sixth Sense
=
Oh, why can't you go? I can't wait to see why it's cool ..... Why do you think this stage truly suits Lovelyz ??? It's frustrating. You should maximize the stage to make the stage shine .. This is the level that confuses Oh My ... If you don't drop out of this episode, please come back and think about what group Lovelyz has been up to now.
=
It's funny and keeps coming back ...
=
No matter how you look at it, Kay has to write a reflection.
=
Lovelyz is a ballad group ... wrong choice.
=
Oh my song I just didn't shatter
=
I'm POP ~ It's not a popping feeling, but the wind is falling.
=
To be honest, I don't want to be visual. The problem is that the vocal sound is so empty that it's really noisy. I thought I played a guided demo version on this stage by mistake.
=
Seo Ji-soo: You look like Cain and you did well ...
=
Please, just pretend to be pretty when you just pop a K-pop.
=
I think I'm okay with this stage except K-pop's part ..
=
Ryu Sujeong was so good and wink at high treble ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ I've been in a group wink.
=
Baby Soul doesn't like that
=
Unfortunately, why ...
=
Bibliography 1:38 Noneedtoworryloveisjustagame Funny
=
It's just pop in this part ... ㅋㅋㅋ Paap ~ ♡ Paap ~ ♡
=
I can't see anything except rap part of Seo Ji Soo. Seo Su Ji seems to be good at innocence, but she seems to be able to extinguish her new concept. So, she was talented in acting because she tried to act as a web drama.
=
Lovelyz's not good at all.
=
I can't even see you
=
I don't like the surge
=
Who says V Girl Trump sounds better than Lovelyz
=
4:36 It's a pity not to dolphin
=
The other part is okay ... K-POP ...... !!
=
I only understand Serge Su's unique concept of chewing Six Sense, and I think gestures and facial expressions appear on the stage. Why did you make pretty expressions in this song?
=
I honestly don't know anything else but I don't know why I gave Kay that part of Papa.
=
Jisoo is out for a while.
=
Sister went to war alone.
=
Oh, I'm a bit sad now ... I don't know the group called Lovelyz but Baby Soul and Ji-soo Su were good at it. <I just made other stages so hard to arrange and choreographed a new feeling ...
=
It's more frustrating, so beagirl six sense
Turn on, Zea Paap !!!!! Paap !!!!!
=
The treble is honestly okay.
=
Is it Ryu? Eye spasm will happen
=
My Youtube Routine
1. sees children's fire
2. Admire the latata
3.I see lovely sixth sense to see a comment
4. Look at the eye to cleanse the eyes and ears.
5. I will continue my trip.
=
Honestly, Kay isn't close to vocals, but I can't sing here.
Atlantis and you and me are good at digesting ...
=
It becomes a pop
=
2:00 I want to share with you
=
Haha lol
=
I've been expecting a little bit in the beginning, but I'm expecting the bottom with a baby's voice and a pretty look ....
And pop !!! pop !!! It should be like this
=
Ryusujung is better than gel
=
Looking back, it's awesome
Once a person is born, try a challenge
If you major in everyday life
=
I don't keep my personal shots, but I don't have a personal shot. Amnet ... The spectrum is so wide that I'm a vocal. The band is also high.
=
Is this a lip sync ???
=
Why is it so funny that I want to look pretty when I tremble Kay?
=
They are not Korean ...... It'll be better than this
=
It's been a month and a half since ...
=
Just paying for nick ... Lovelyz is sixth sense.
=
The voice does not go along with the song. I managed to go to the gin part, but I couldn't hear my voice. What do they feel like putting on cosmetics to imitate their mother? The voice itself is youthful but the music and lyrics are so dark that it is not harmonious. And in the middle of it, I put a hand kiss in there ... Singing and atmosphere, and it's all in style.
=
The stage quality is badly bad
1. Too obvious intro performance
2. You have to look at the camera when you wave, but your eyes are half closed
3. Sweat Drops
⭐4. Kay Pahab ~ ❤
5. Kay Wink
6. Kay Sonkiss
7. Elite Wink
8. Elite Pretending
9. Seo Ji-soo's Awkward Expression (Interpretation is Good)
10. Dan without impact
11. I'll do my part, roughly go out (open your mouth wide)
12. K gestures with two horses
13. Smile Ryu Soo
14. Fatty expressions of Yuji
15. Elite's Oriole Vocal
16. Yuji Ae's Baby Boy
17. Baby Soul gives off a sad clip
18. Anesthetized like a subconscious mind, the gap between the back dancer and the end of his part, awkward gestures, gestures and facial expressions
19. Suh Ji Soo's Amateur Distorted Gesture
20. Already the palm of your hand salute
20. Yuji Ae and Elite Boring Tiki-Taka Rap
21.The world's soulless fire + meaningless movement into and out of
22. Kay's Clear Treble
23. Lower the Hanok by raising the treble
24. Kay's Caustic Insistence
25. Wink Ryu Su Jung
26. Ambiguous finish
27. V-app attitude
28. Omgirl Ignore
29. Feedback ears
30. Block Id + Tide
=
Egogo .. Selection Songs! Lovelyz I've always been good and good, but it didn't go well with this song, and I didn't get the girl crush because I couldn't catch the stage concept. Stage that will take a beagirl.
=
Are you sure you know the concept? Sexy + I
I'm getting confused. This is why Lovelyz winks in the middle and pretends to be pretty, but of course I can ... But if the girl comes out like a really delicious thick noodle noodles, Lovelyz has a voice like cold noodles ,,,, Cody is really good.
=
I don't think that's the best number of surges
=
Only Paap seems to be the problem, but Beso did a good job.
=
The singers are also a bit of a banquet party.
=
I can't eat children.
=
I think I prepared hard but I don't know the concept and I think there are loopholes I think it's a little better quality than the videos and videos on YouTube ... I actually felt a little awkward when I saw the video I feel like I'm sorry to hear that ... If I wanted to show you a girl, I could have done something better than this song. I'm sorry to choose
=
Paap ~ ♡ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's alright until I crush it ...
=
As Lovelyz says, you should consider that the group with the strongest vocals is the right one, but that the> soft vocals are the strongest.
Six Senses is a song so powerful.
Of course, viewers listened to a strong v-girl vocal, but it's comparable ... It's like a tombstone.
=
Do you feel only me? Seems to be centered on something pretty
Brown girl's voice is heavy, but it sounds strange because it's too loud
=
Looking at the comments, I courageously look back
=
Imju Johnna My Style
=
The really interesting thing is that Lovelyz wasn't the last one in the second contest.
=
Even if you don't want to compare ... Oh My Girl and Lovelyz are both too different. Live was also a high level and injured .....
=
I don't think you understand the concept except Ryu Soo-jung and Seo Ji-soo.
=
How would you like to hear B-girl sing in Queendom? I think ..... I think it's an all-kill.
=
Don't have power in pop
=
It was a good attempt. Sometimes change or transformation is necessary.
=
Seeing this stage, I can see the difference between Omgirl Lovelyz concept
Om girl: good at letting
RUPLY: Just do it
=
Lol
=
Six Senses ... I thought it was a song of coercive and authoritative atmosphere and concept. It's okay because I know you tried. Lovelyz sisters are pretty.
=
It's one of the stages that I often see in Queendom, but it's a bit similar to Pew 48 Kang Hye-won and Han Cho-won's Boombaya-jo.
=
Eh...? What is this...? I don't know what Kay is really doing. Do you know what that song is? It's hard for other groups to respond like that.
=
What's the tone like this? I don't want to hear it.
=
People don't know what the bad guys are
=
Honestly, if you don't look at the original song, it's not bad.
=
2:48 Why is it cool that she is beckoning to look in the camera?
=
I think you only understood the song
What else did they get stuck in?
=
Wow, it was a real beagirl. I heard you pop while listening to her pop
=
Sisters would rather sing B.A. L.O.V.E. I should have done my style ... This song is not really ...
=
If you don't know the original song of B-girl, it seems like you are younger sensibilities these days. In fact, I thought Six Sense was free and a little bit awkward, but I watched the previous stage twice in Queendom. Even though the expression looks cool, the suction power and the overwhelming powerful are wonderful ~ ♡ There may be differences in taste, but each one's charm ~ ^^
=
What on earth did you think that's caustic?
=
Lovelyz ♥ ️ ♥ ️
=
This is me
=
Six Senses should be called crazy, but it's my taste.
=
Didn't they feel strange and awkward as they practiced? Didn't you know one?
=
I'm so famous that I came to know how good you are.
=
I don't hate Lovelyz, but I can't sing too much.
=
The last time I was upset for 6, my agency gave me a choice. So, if I'm singing, there's a limit to what I can show. This time, Rubley commented that 95% had commented. I don't think it's anymore. I wondered if it suited you or not. Why would you ... ㅠㅠ I would rather have a lot of omg closers or a pair. I can see how much I usually wanted to do girl crush, but in the middle of K, the hand kiss, the cute voice of Jiae, Kay's pahab, and everybody's awkward song and gin even made the wrong lyrics. I'm sorry, but I think the 6th place is Lovelyz but the 6th place is Lovelyz. If it's not sixth,
=
Yuna was a facial expression legend. Why can't I see it all of a sudden?
=
In fact, the Queendom's largest output
=
There are many people who cannot distinguish between criticism and criticism here ,,,,,,,
=
K-vocals are so innocent that only the parameters are bursting, but sometimes it's an advantage, but this time it's a disadvantage. ㅠㅠ Baby Hunter ??
=
Honestly, Oh My Girl is a really miracle fan of Miracle ... Because it's two teams with the same innocent feeling, I honestly thought about what kind of innocence it would change.
=
Treble and creepy face
=
I'm looking at this.
=
I didn't know if Su Ji could do this .... Ha ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's amazing. .. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Jindo ....
However, it's a pity that Kay and everyone are more likely to kill and eat. I'll write it there once.
I loved the stage that was lovelyized with the moderately beautiful and pretty girls.
I think it's because the kids who have been suited have become the main. Seeing it ... ㅠㅠ If you have a comfortable voice that I originally had, I would like it to be a little more like Jisoo or America.
Oh, I didn't know it was too long but oh my girl wasn't a song ... I thought I wanted to try a different concept.
=
What confidence do you have when you say that you're confident in vocals?
=
Lovelyz is just lovely
=
What should I do? After showing this to a friend, I'm bored in the classroom or I'm hungry for love ~ ♡ Paup ~ ♡ I'm hungry ~ ♡ I can't hit one,
=
The next station is the new song of comeback Brown Eyed Girls.
=
I would have done better if Mamamu had done.
Why aren't kids with a voice ...
=
Is this something that B-Girls thanked Lovelyz for or did they buy Rice that they were sorry for B-girl?
=
3:51 I thought you were beaten by the back dancers.
=
3:37 Miyeon: What did I see?
=
What did you see when I came to see you for a second? 2:04 It looks like Solar is a catastrophe. Ha ha ha
=
4:17 Looks like a subtitle.
=
Why do you look so weak when you have four raps?
=
4:17 Hahahahahah!
=
In fact, even in the music so far
Sixth Sense was the hardest song to express
Of course, the live song is too difficult
Someone
Reinterpret our song
To make you remember
Actually, thank you so much
191026 I'm a big brother.
=
I don't even live and make famous songs into trash. It's annoying.
=
4:09 I can't forget it.
=
It's a real face, it's different from Omar girl
=
4:48 Oh, you laugh, you don't say anything.
=
Back dancers also seem to have no strength and angle
=
Ah, I thought these were issues because they were good.
=
Lack of charisma and voice power. Too frustrating. One hundred times better
=
2:06 lol It looks like a fat hamster is leaving the expedition
=
After a five-hour dawn journey, I'm a virtuoso to her sister. All Veargirl videos have traces of Queendom viewers, so don't worry, enter the related videos. Sisters are really ridiculous.
=
I didn't see it when I came up with anti-horsepower ... I can't see it now.
=
The only video that shows Korean comments in the Queendom stage
=
Even if I don't know the song and the dance, I'm embarrassed. ㅌ ㄹㅋ ㄹㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅅㄹ ㅋㄹ ㅅㅋ
=
1:48 Are you laughing?
=
But ....... but really addicted
=
I can see how charismatic she is.
=
Oh, here's Codyman.
=
Mamamu seems to be more appropriate ..
=
When you pop, there's no fuss
=
I'm here to see a dolphin, but I can't see my tail .......
=
I hit her
=
I sing better than the Americas
=
My sister is the best
=
Why are the kids so good at singing?
In the original song, I sing like a belt / rock
These are just so soft and pretty
Isn't it enough to build the vocal level in the first place?
=
I respect Brea girls.
=
Lovelyz vocals, dancing unit stage and cameo stage watching Lovelyz so well I just left this as a memory video Actually, everyone doesn't live perfectly every day? I try to challenge myself, look at bitter tastes and develop my dreams, so I feel like watching the stage of Lovelyz Pandora Cameo.
=
Come whenever you need a smile
=
Was it Halloween Day?
=
Pretend to be criticism and be ill ...
=
I'm sorry Lovelyz ...
=
I hope you didn't compare. Looks different than bad.
=
Egong Pretty
=
It's not a surprised expression
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ 뎈 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'm a soldier's daughter, so I keep salute ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No evil
=
I have a lot of talk because of a bad one, but I don't want to get it.
=
It's a pity that the pop is not so strong. It should be pa ~~ pressure ~~~
=
Benefit had a lot of better choices.
I have to pick a song that should not be touched ..
There's an obsession with being too new
It's a stage to kill all the strengths of members
That's too bad
=
Why are you doing this song? It's a really difficult song. Every time I talked to her, this song was a really difficult song. I used to be a vocal group song.
=
Zea's vocals and her rap skills
It made me feel how great
It was a meaningful stage.
=
In my opinion, the kids let me do 95% of the time and the agency said, 'Do what you want to do.
=
I understand the song: Lee Mi-joo, Ryu Soo-jeong, and Seo Ji-soo.
=
There's a magical power that I can't see so much.
=
Paa Aaa ~ Ahaab ~
=
It's like this song's a miss song, and the difference between Kay's voice and my voice is so big
=
Biggest Beneficiary: Beagirl eating at home
=
Kay, you've broken up as a part of you?
Kpop'
=
Since the tone is pure and innocent, I can't help it. But you smile, wink, and hand heart. Have you ever watched B-girl's music video or stage? I feel like I've been in a galk since I was at Achu. I should've played gall with Destiny. I really wake up, vocaloid treble
=
If Kay hadn't been Xabian, he would have gone halfway.
=
There's no brains in Lovelyz ... I felt it was over with a bad meaning when I heard the first bar.
Girlkish and sexy already have other teams, but innocent team scooped up eggs with rocks ... even if there are teams with overlapping images, they will be bold in concept planning. I'm done ...
=
Oh my girl says "a cappella" with a closure ... it must have gotten really good, but there are so many pretty tones in the world.
=
It was a stage where my company insisted on pure innocence concept. Just follow innocence.
=
Jisoo understands the song ... well done ..... but it's a song that should be done like that.
=
Is this the concept of a battleground consolation?
=
2:54 degrees.
=
Maximum beneficiaries at this time
1.Om girl with legendary song
2.Bear girl running backwards while eating at home
3.6, but praised children
4.Someone coordination (and exponent)
5.K was proud of K-Pop
6.Guardian Miyaon
=
PewD48 48 Hellbaya is addictive, and many people weave together. In particular, after getting an advantage that they can do other girl groups other than Oh My Girl songs, they picked one of the many famous girl groups themselves .... It's like you're chopping on your own and they're going up there and grabbing the sword.
=
I think Seung Heon is better than these guys
=
I see why you did it right now.
=
If you are listening, it's tingling and you don't want to listen.
The omg girls reaction is intense ,,,
=
I just guessed the wrong interpretation .. ;;; Hung Hung -_-
What's have do by sing a song ?? !!
=
Why don't you feed the girls evenly?
=
Mamamu is the only group that can digest that song
=
Lovelyz If you keep the sexy concept, it's good to know that my girl is pure innocence .. It's better to do what you're good at.
=
Wouldn't it have been a bit different if I tried to revive my feelings well? For example, when you sing a song, it sings with power to each lyrics. Take the first measure as an example, "I can't be helped ~ Never Tach me, Tach. Rush, Rush." Don't call me like this, "Road! I can't go in! I can't do it! Uh! I don't know how much money I've run out of time. If you were confident enough to choose, you should have thought about how you would call it. It's already gone, so I can't reverse it.
=
I didn't know Lovelyz but it seems to be a different meaning ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I don't know the other section, but the POP section is still called by Power Vocalist. The original song is the power that is pulled up from the ship. I don't know about Lovelyz, so I don't know the members, but if it's a low number, maybe there was a member who could sing powerfully.
=
If Lovelyz had a closure, ... the Great War would have happened.
=
There's something awkward ... The members all have a thin voice on the lap ... I felt the arrangement and the last song, but I'm not good enough compared to other teams. I understand how the song progresses ..... take care of the ringing.
I think ...
=
Do you have the best number of bibliography? LOL
=
합 ️
=
I don't know the comments are scary.
The celebrity mourners who were left hurt by bad guys a while ago are different.
=
It's only possible at first.
I can't listen to you
=
Never seen in full screen
=
Didn't you watch the original song in the first place?
=
Did you save the original song stage?
=
Ah, I'm going to fly more than the comments
=
No, I'm not scared.
=
It is hard to make eye contact because the expression of the person tied with high head is burdensome ....
=
This is what ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
4:49 Honestly leaving
=
The members of the Missouri and Ryu Soo-jeong seem to be thirsty for this concept. I'm pushing some parts to those greedy and good members. The members who don't go well with this song are tired of the killing part. It's my first time to do what I want to do but it looks so bad
=
Separate criticism from ridicule
=
Besso did pop instead of Kay.
=
Lovelyz members have reacted to this stage and want to make a better stage. There's a guy behind the monitor.
=
Here's the sensational ridiculous 넼 ㅋㅌ ㅌㅌㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅌㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
3:33 As if I'm unconscious,
=
4:18 It's really funny to have (High notes!) At the English subtitles lol.
=
However, thanks to this stage, my YouTube was reminiscent of memories, and I was able to rethink my school life when I was happy, worried, and sad.
=
The stage that made me feel so great again
=
3:46 Highlight this video
=
Likely to enter the anti-horsepower video someday
=
4:26 Park Bom was really creepy.
=
It's a powerful song and a pretty chuck and a wink ... If you had a good interpretation of the song, it wouldn't have been controversial.
=
I don't see the news, I'm still bad
=
3:54 WoW ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
3:54 Waha ;;;
=
In fact, the big picture of a company trying to monetize its views
=
It's important to know how great each of the members is.
=
I'm not doing it without diligence, but I think I'm working hard.
=
Here are the bad guys
=
4:54 Didn't you react?
=
Why do you keep popping ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's like looking at a little frightening ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's hard to hear this song until the end ..
=
4:48 D o my expression is ridiculous
=
Lovelyze fighting!
=
No, but this video is addictive
In front of you ~
=
It's a real drug video It's too bad but I keep looking for it
=
I did this at first but sometimes it comes in.
=
Why do you have to press Papa Papa?
=
At the same time, the number of surges is better,
=
Wow ... it's coming this year but you're still getting wet here
No, I can't see my horsepower
What's up to date?. ;; ㅋㅋ
=
Cameo back to see
=
Exciting and comfortable every time you enter the hometown of the mind;
=
Cayman on pop
=
It's more than B-girl Six Sense.
=
This is ...
=
Tiger meow cute
=
As the Lord is best at,
=
It's getting better as I keep listening, I'm crazy ;;;
=
What's wrong with the speaker turned off?
=
I'll see you again.
=
The pop part is so much ... Why did you have to do this ... Unfortunately, it's a real song.
=
Prisoner concept.
=
I'd rather Ryu Sujeong
=
As if they were too absurd
=
I mentioned indirectly B-girl.
How much did you laugh
=
Kay: Paap ♥ (Frowning)
Index: Soaking
Children: scared
Park Bom: Creepy
Jiho: Miyaon
=
Does this song I heard show a woman's strength, not a woman's strength? If it was like that, it's just because it looks pretty and sexy, and it's sad because it feels only outside ... Is this idol knowing the meaning of this song?
=
Ha ... a stage that only sighs ...
=
As a third-year fan who saw Lovelyz's youthful appearance, the Six Senses stage was so good because I could see the uniqueness of Lovelyz.
=
If you had a cute concept ...
=
It's not a miracle that this is not the sixth place.
=
Ryu Soo Jung? I think only this friend understands the song and Kay should get away from the affinity. The voice assignments should be different according to the song.
=
As far as I can see, Su Ji Su seems to have played the best songs on the nude lip.
=
It's funnier than a Gacon, ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㄱㅋ ㄱㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㄱ ㄲㄱ
=
Ke ha ~~~~ It's really funny 넼 ㄱㅋ ㄱㄱㄱ ㄱㄱㄱㄱ ㄱㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ kay every time I get out
=
I think Kei shouldn't call Pop. This is a girl.
=
I did it at first but I still tried. Honestly, I've been doing tea tea for a few years, but if you don't do any pushes at your company, I think you've worked hard. I actually did a good job on the next stage. But what if you sang oh my girl? The idea of ​​is not erased. I wouldn't have sweared like this.
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Look back and laugh 개 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ K-Hand gesture for the wink shot ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I know I sing well, but I'm so strong in Zea's part that it's too empty ... Ryu Sujeong feels like the tone is fine ... I think it'll be great if Lovelyz finds the right concept and song for you. ... a little sad ㅠㅠ
=
I came to see my brother again, but it's still not good.
=
Oh, it seems like I get addicted once a week
=
Seo Ji-soo This was my first impression. Take a look at the web
=
Since debut, since I was innocent, I know that I want to show you something new or want to challenge ... Did you really give any advice when you practice or record this?
As the members turn to this song, they wink at once cutely and refreshingly.
=
I'm okay with it
=
I know why your company doesn't use that concept.
=
The main culprit of this song cover is the main vocal cable ...
=
Already do the best.
=
No, it's the stuff that shouldn't be touched ;;;
What's wrong with pop in the first place?
Most of all, this song is a song that should be focused solely on sexy
No .... see someone named Ryu Soojung Did
Since then it has completely collapsed ;;;; This song is more sexy
It's a stage where you can feel the powerful wild girl crush.
It's a strange arrangement, except for the fascinating song. Who lays the bass later ;;;
=
Destiny stolen and I left Paap.
=
I thought I was out of air when pop ~~
=
It's just too much for everyone .. Awkward as one ... It's awkward and there are so many people, but no one has a clear color and clear planning power like Jeon So-yeon. Oh My Girl had a good idea when they were meeting and they knew what their colors were ...
=
The sixth sense paap that I know was that Zea was howling like a tiger. I think it's a distance ... Hellbaya did a good interpretation of the music.
=
Is there anyone who sang except for cody ????? Cody didn't even get it on stage.
=
I don't think much about my group.
In addition, it seems like there was a complaint about the concept that the company only gave so far. That's why everybody wants to get married.
=
It's a typical example of mass-produced idols.
=
What if you sing this song while pretending to be pretty?
Winks Son Kiss.
Groups coming out in the middle The expressions are really ..
I really really can't manage facial expressions.
=
Oh My Girl, Lovelyz I loved it since my debut and I have all the albums. I think you did a good job and showed a lot of good looks. But it's too much for Lovelyz to take such a swear word. In the comments, there was a schedule that only my girl had a schedule, but not all singers had a schedule. There is a lack of Lovelyz, but I practiced for a day or two because my company gave me an arrangement at that time. My agency didn't work properly either. I was late and the arrangement was not good, and Lovelyz had some unfortunate parts. There is a lack of stages, so of course you can be criticized, but there is no reason to blame your appearance, personality, or previous stages. People who go to every Lovelyz video and mention Ohmy are not polite. I'm talking about attitude, but my girl also says it's burdensome. There will be editing issues. Of course, at the same burden, I think oh my girl and wm did well. The song change was provided by the Queendom side and I just changed it to what I wanted to win in the game, but I am sorry that I didn't come out with the song, but I think it's not enough to be sour as it goes. It was also a question of the Queendom program that we announced on the morning that Lovelyz didn't mean that. If you're a problem with Lovelyz v app, you're not sure. Is it really good to be ridiculed by referring to videos, articles, comments, blogs, even if you don't have any innocence, and to go to the Lovelyz stage video and mention Ohmy?
It wasn't just in response to the stage or criticism, but it was just that Lovelyz responded that way. The critics are not right or mature. There are some places where Lovelyz should be criticized,
Don't justify their wrong and don't rationalize their actions. Oh My Girl and Lovelyz I've been doing well with you for a long time. And it's a chance that Lovelyz was forced to do what he did on the Queen's side, and so on. The opportunity just came and caught the chance, it's not wrong. The better the result, the better. Oh my girl, Lovelyz, and all the other teams If you really think about my girl, don't blame him or do anything wrong.
=
The most angry thing about them is that they watched the stage so easily. Other teams show traces of trying to match their colors. Arrangement, choreography, concept almost unchanged. It's very disappointing.
=
You know what you want to do, but don't do it.
=
Make-up is like Halloween dress up at Lotte World.
=
Do you still see this? Lovelyz Cameo Stage show Lovely Lovelyz
=
I'm really sorry, but it's better to get off the ground and swear at this place .. I don't want to make black history anymore.
It's obvious that it touched Six Sense, so Queendom was poisoned by Lovelyz.
=
Comments are really funny

2:55 ... ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ

One is not immersed
One is suitable
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This is the win of a girl girl Queendom
=
Is this the stage of the legend that their agency voluntarily explained it as a stage?
=
If you didn't do that, you would have said that you didn't understand the concept.
=
4:54 Park Bom ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Did you follow the children's fire?
=
ㅋㅋㅋ Originally, the voice is not correct.
=
Biggest Beneficiary: Baagirl at home
=
How on earth did these children do last?
=
But I don't think it's funny ㅋㅋㅋ Park Bom is also an idol that existed in the age of singing ... When I saw that part of the treble explode.
=
I just shouldn't have sang this song
=
What happens if you don't know the difference between criticism and criticism
=
Honestly, the start was haha
But I did better than children ;;;
Mnet can't believe anything.

It's funny and I'm coming to see ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ

You're so good.

America really is so pretty ..
=
I was born second, and I was depressed. I watched the stage and read comments.
=
These guys will come out of Queendom and eat away all the images that were there ...
=
And how do you wink here ..;
=
No matter how hard you pull it up, Kei Nao comes back to the instant ...............

Loosening in pa ~ ap

Tympanic terror
I have to go to the original song
Seriously six sense
=
I keep thinking about it. It's strangely addictive.

3:45 You know what?
=
It's scary but the bragirl is so full.

~~~
=
[High-explosion] When K-face and gesture a little son is like a rich wife who suffers from living with the girl who lives on the rooftop without marrying the woman he chooses.
=
Foreign fans don't know and like the original song ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm not tired. I don't call it this.
=
Ryu Soo-Jung was the best at detecting six senses ... bb
=
I love you
=
Busy pretending to be pretty
=
Shock itself
=
I've been following the YouTube Algorithm and I can't be a lady. By day, if I'm going to do a real challenge, I'll do something like F (x) Red Light.
=
1 wave per day
=
Baby Soul is ...
=
Even that high-pitched lip sync ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ AAO reaction is real
=
I think you should just blame Cay.
That vocal with song understanding ...
=
I'm laughing today
=
Come to charge
=
It's funny how other singers react
=
It's worse when I listen to it with earphones ...
=
Now, even if you search by Pahab, it's ranked first .. ㄷㄷ
=
Is this a lip sync?
=
There was a mention of Lovelyz in every Six Sense video, so I did something ...
=
It's similar to the feeling of seeing Tachi 1 [Original Song] Tachi 3 [Arrange].
=
The most memorable thing on this stage is:
Jiho Miyaon 3:46
=
We are us, but how did the two MCs in the field react? And some camera directors have more than 10 years of experience. What did you think of them as you filmed them?
=
It's a different level in another sense.
=
It's better than sheep
=
Children fire 2:05 2:05 Park Bom is dancing
Same as Lovelyz Six Sense 4:53 4:53.
=
Tell me your wish...

This is not enough feedback ^^ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ 걍 I can comment like this, but I can't open it.

It's similar to Ryu Soo-jeong's Cain's voice ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
This is also suspicious of manipulation .....
Real stage castle
No matter how the chance, how can you ignore the opposing team's song?
=
Oh, it's funny. ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ Keep coming. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The stage was honestly sixth, but Amnet saved it. Honestly, did you know Mnet?
=
Ehe often sees it
=
I think it's okay to stay here.
=
Was this song originally light and thin?
=
Like a beloved love
=
Well
=
If you don't finish 6th place in Lovelyz this time
=
How can I pretend that song is so pretty?
=
Why aren't you going to cover the group because of the group's songs?
=
There's no feeling of popping. Beagirl calls like a bomb.
And was this song singing with a smile ???
Shouldn't it feel like hitting and popping?
=
I couldn't interpret the song so much as to doubt whether I saw the stage. At first, it wasn't just the level of galk, but the level of killing people. Well, the tones are so thin and thin, but even on that stage, Wink's kisses are wondering.
=
It wasn't the fourth place. Before the lyrics, Wow, it was the first and the lyrics came out.
=
If you don't stick to the girly concept, you will feel comfortable at the top of the list.
=
Lovelyz is a little uncomfortable every time.
The arrangement was the same as the last time
This time, I killed the strength of the original song even more
And why are you winking? Don't wink
=
Oh my girl, it's a pity that their songs don't come out of this contest.
=
In the broadcast, 95 pros said that they wanted to make up the stage as they wanted .... If the result is this, it should be said that there is no sensed member in the team called Lovelyz. This is a huge song and I have to do it several times well, but I'm not good at vocals ... I'm not good at dancing .... I'm doing the stage with zero concept ... It feels like a different ... The other teams retained the original team color, but also showed a different appearance, so if the stage was a richer feeling, Lovelyz lost the original team color and failed to show another look ... It's not new and why not I only think I would have done it.
=
4:18
One ear beautifully blocked, one pelvis beautifully outside .. The world smiles pretty ..
Yeah you're pretty ... pretty ... ha ...
=
Six Senses have to be ripped like a crazy lion, but it's too thin. Papa❤️ Papa❤️
=
Oh, oh my girl, other groups, especially children, I think I was shocked lol. Blah blah.
=
If you say this, it's a bit basic but the bass is ugly and I'm trying to pretend to be pretty in the song.
And I want to know that the concept of n-year-old Yodol who started with innocence is not necessarily naked sexy.
=
I'd rather give baby soul to Papa, why would you give me Kay?
=
Let's distinguish criticism from criticism. ^-^
Everyone makes mistakes, but win over it
It's important to pay. Lovelyz woke up. I showed you a great stage called Moonlight. What's the matter?
Yes, Lovelyz was accused of misinterpretation of the song, the curve of the heart, and the curve of the heartbeat. But I overcame it. I didn't hit the cover even though I was a fan. It was my choice.
But even after a few days, I get annoyed by the sarcastic people with this video. I know you don't speak badly.
What's the difference from this bad guy?
Just don't comment without thinking
Don't you think the road is too much?
=
Who says
Begirl sixth sense-> active female officer
Lovelyz sixth sense-> Elementary School Girl Scout
=
The reaction of the omg girl's whole body .. I'm sure you wanted to cover your own songs. The rosy stage itself was fine, but they didn't arrange their own colors or arrange them. But it is said that it's awkward because it doesn't work well with the compelling vocals and the neutral and original song. It doesn't mean you can't vocal, but the color and tone are so different that the cover without arrangement doesn't fit. I'd rather arrange it to suit the tone and mood of the person, or just touch the ohm girl and try to touch it well.
=
Whew ... Why did you play this song?
Mamamu can barely digest it here ...
=
I don't know why their name is Lovelyz
=
0:43
The most soulless 'awesome' I've ever heard in my 26 years
=
Watch point
1. Scary of Shu
2. Miyaon of Jiho
3. Anti-horsepower test
=
Ryu Sujeong and Kay rolled out all the stage ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Oh, of course, I did not do the rest well Ryusujeong and Kay wink counting time
=
I'll leave all the pop parts to Sam Sok Sol.
=
Mimi: I think I'm showing sexy
Infant: Doesn't it feel like a little unsealed?
=
3:05 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I know what it feels like.
=
Obviously, I've been seeing you and YouTube has brought me here, but there's something in common that's caught in the algorithm. There's a lot of guys like me.
=
3:38 Jo Mi-yeon's face lol .. You're embarrassed ..?
=
4:36 I think I've seen this often
=
Why do I keep watching like PDU48 Hellbaya?
=
Ah, but Ryu Soo-jeong's voice is like Cain
=
Mossing more views than Lovelyz MV
=
3:37 Miyeon's expression is serious. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅠㅋ ㅠㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
If you keep watching me
=
It's uncomfortable to listen to the concept of baby soul and K.
=
Park Bom's interview empathizes with the difference between what is good and what you want to do is a big difference ... Lovelyz and Oh My Girl is mentioned as the reason that is revealed here ... Contest because of the impact and want to do something powerful I know it well, but I can't feel the group's ability.
=
Park Bom Seolhyun expression
=
Didn't anyone dry?
=
It's just like the Americas,
=
Now come here to comment
=
4:26 You've almost turned the stage upside down
=
I hit K-pop and it's coming out;
=
4:51 What's okay ~ I got the concept too wrong but the video is too drug.
=
No, bring me a singer.
=
I feel so sweet now
=
This is why I keep coming to this video
I'm really cancerous to watch and treat that cancer
Watch this, listen to the original song, watch the comparison video, memories
I go to listen so I hate the first part
It's like you're coming to see ...
=
4:33 Lee Mangi?
=
Why are the children's fires lower than Pahab ~ ♡.
=
I really like Seung Heon, but I'm sorry.
=
How many times do I come to see this?
This is a drug video
=
4:36 Miyaon ??
=
I should have done closer
=
Um ... this stage ...
Quite a bit ...
Be prepared to battle with others ...
I'll shield.
This is ... you can shield it ...
=
4:33 Me neither
=
Why did you want to do this?
=
I knew why not. Seboy doesn't interpret the song if he only wears clothes and mecup.
=
Pahab ~~
=
Um, I think the most power is very light.
=
I remember this song because of this
I keep seeing it for some reason
=
I've heard you've done a sixth sense to change the concept color, but all that's changed is Cody and Song, and the rest, especially Wink Sonkiss, seem to be the same.
=
I'm just going to take a look at this alternately with a beh blah blah blah blah blah blah
=
Why is there only baby soul in the tag?
=
Pa-ap!
=
There is no impact ...
=
No you keep looking !!!!!
=
Academic level
=
Whenever I watch the first 2nd videos of Lovelyz, Seolhyun's expression is the funniest ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Really.
=
Kay just keeps going innocent
=
My voice is so weak ... It's true that strong feelings work well in an audition, but ... It seems like it wasn't good to show Lovelyz's feeling as Park said.
I don't like it, but I only feel it
=
It's a little different between Lovelyz members ... It's like half the kids who have to go with girly / sexy feelings
=
As if Sam Sool is singing the best concept
=
Something good, but a little frustrating .. Something frustrating .. I almost feel like throwing or throwing.
=
Dropout necklace given to him
=
Next time, I would like to select a song that suits the mood of the group.
=
Why are you arranging the accompaniment?
=
So, if you don't bounce more than other parts, you can't distinguish where the song is in verse 1 and verse 2.
So go find your activities and rewind.
=
Does the editor hate you?
=
Ah..........
=
Cody and Serge Su are the best here.
=
Stop the towing too.
=
please...
=
뻡뻡 뻡뻡
=
This is the first time since the good day of The One
=
Really, this is a video that remains in history.
=
There is no confidence in one's own strengths, as in self-objectivity and strange confidence in a little lacking.
=
Girls' Generation Tiara Kara 2ne1 Wonder Girls

1:50 Kay Hand Kiss
1:56 1:58 Tow Wink
3:11 Winks
4:13 (I don't know if it's a wink, but it's a wink) Wink at the tow camera
4:41 Crystal Wink
Sixth Sense is not a song that winks and hands kisses, but has to be eaten.
If the girl and lovely girls are in the meadow, they are already eaten by them.
=
fun
=
Sergeant understands songs well
=
My voice doesn't go well with Six Sense ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
I think Ryu Soo-jung was a bit better at Cain, but the others are ...
I think everyone's voices are younger (?) But I wish I could sing a girl's generation with a pure or youthful feeling
If you had to replace the K part with another one, I wouldn't have felt this heterogeneous
This is not a bad apple
=
It seems like the number of bibliography is good.
=
But weren't you singing with Oh My Girl? Oh, you've been singing a beagirl without breaking anything.
=
But why do I feel like they're closer than those with a burning sun? Couldn't cover song be more sin than hidden camera + prostitution + drug ;;;
=
Ryu Soojung's eyes are moist, and his voice is sweet
=
Indices? I think you studied Cainbun's face so hard. Um ... I think I tried, but it's awkward.
=
Baby Soul Baby
=
It seems like the kids are attending a school conference .... I have chosen the wrong song. B-girl is a girl group idol who is older and not innocent but pushes sexy .. Lovelyz is the opposite ... Seo Ji-soo is really immersed in choreography and singing. I'm so good. Why did you call it wildflowers or the western sky? You could say "pop" like this. Even when you blast, treble, like a lovely song.
=
No, I'm going to be frustrated Lovelyz Yes Why are you so obsessed with this?
=
The original concept of Brea Girl is the same, but the difference in singing power is so excellent.
Even if I just watched the original music video, the comment that the B-girl was a beneficiary ...
The stage itself is something powerless and feels worse than the original song?
=
Six Senses can't survive Mammum, Queendom's top, but they're good at self-objectioning.
=
If you come to me
Pop the guy who distributed the part to Kay
=
It's a gel advantage, but it doesn't make a big impression.
=
I don't know if it's just me .. Others have a refreshing two-teenth face. Jin or something. He doesn't seem to be the oldest.
=
Except for Seo Ji Soo and Already ..... Especially, Kay is swearing.
=
Jeon So-yeon is Sixth Sense! I'm so addicted to it
=
I'd rather call it my cupid or closure, so I'd have digested it better ... like a girlfriend with a fingertip.
I think I changed the song, but not Benefit.
=
It's an individual ㅋㅋㅋ You are good at it. Why did you do this?
=
As if the year changed with children
=
One side misinterpreted the song, and the other side is too full of expression.
=
I know what I really want to do, but I feel like I'm getting the wrong points every time I'm so sorry ... ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
The 1st contest was to prepare their songs to stand out more, and the 2nd contest is to prepare a good (popular) song more radically and freshly ... It's too bad that the points are wrong each time. Be good, but all the good songs are famous, and they are famous, so they are stuck in the head of the public, so I think the novel remake or performance is the center.)
In the case of Lovelyz, there was no singer limitation as much as the chance, but it was too bad that they couldn't choose a song that they could make attractive when they sang. .
On the other hand, Oh My Girl catches the points well. I understand that the colors of Lovelyz and music are similar, and I changed it to Oriental style without feeling the same. It was a very positive factor in this lecture.
=
I'd rather have a uniform concept
=
Oh my girl is the best reaction I think it would have been a pity for us not to sing.
=
How much did you not react to the other stage of the reaction .....
=
I think it would have been much better if I covered songs like Kara Lupine and Mr ....
=
Parkbom's "creepy" middle expression c.
=
3:45 Zhao meow cute.
=
Maybe it would have been better to have a banana allergic monkey concept.
=
I think it's great that Oh My Girl doesn't even sing like that.
=
4:03 I'm with my boyfriend, but who salutes my fingers like that?
=
It's a matter of Kay's gesture or this, but the sound is weak at high frequencies, so I've tried to try harder.
=
But this is better than black Achu
=
4:20 seconds, a string of scabbard due to the sound of toilet flushing
=
Why does Lovelyz always give Kay the main song?
=
Apologize to Bea girl, really .......
=
1:29 Voice Crazy hahahaha
=
It's come back to Beu Girl in 4 years.
=
Why did you choose this song in the beginning? It's the only song that you can play in this song. You couldn't follow the original song even if Mama didn't get a free ticket. Why did you choose this?
=
I've seen a lot of things so I memorized the place where I'm without expression ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This is my favorite scene.
=
Ryu Sujeong was okay to see this.
=
It's ridiculous, so I keep coming to see you. I wish you were closer.
=
This is fourth place
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
What's wrong with me?
=
No, I don't want to, but because I heard the original song and covered it, K's pop sounds much weaker.
=
Wow, it's different from the atmosphere
=
만 I only see this stage and I can't think of anything. Why are people so surprised?
=
Why are everyone barking like dogs !!! Every day ... you are crazy !!!!! stop it...
=
I'm repeating this video once before
=
No, I'm a wink in a girl song.
=
2:15 Another ..
=
Rather, the last treble and paap ~ I think it would have been better if I gave baby part to this part.
=
Crystal and the Americas are good at digesting songs, but except for the rap boy, the voices are generally thin.
Tone ?! Good baby soul there too ..
=
You've been so good at Jisoo.
=
I didn't even see Queendom and I don't know Lovelyz, but ...
=
Here's the restaurant.
=
It's okay to get used to it now ... it's okay to get used to it ... at first I'm really shocked.
=
1:42 5:17 Who would have done better
=
The chorus would have done well as a baby soul solo ...
=
Oh, I didn't see Queendom these days.
=
Cody is the beneficiary of this stage.
=
What did Norain Rain, Seong-woo, come out to live alone?
=
To change Lovelyz, we need to reduce it first. Pretend to be pretty
=
What did I hear now
=
I don't know that sexy fatals don't suit you. If you don't see the reaction, you're just going to the cutie innocent concept.
=
I wasn't coming to see you first.
=
Yuji? It's a baby's voice. It's awkward.
=
Red velvet will go well with this
=
Imizu concept goes well
=
Really ... Lemon did it wrong ...
=
I'm not a b-girl or a lovely fan but it's not a lovely concept. I'm good, but the original song is too late
=
Dolphin sings
=
What is the reaction of B-A-Look in this video ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I think it would have been good for the public if Lovelyz and Maesum performed the song that Mamamu chose.
=
Oh my girl didn't come out of her song, but she was so happy and she was a good-looking idol.
Lol
=
Kpop pop chica real lovelys vs viscelona
=
I came here because it's a comment restaurant
=
Ah.
=
I can't blow six senses like that
=
I really want to see the original song. I was really embarrassed when I popped ...
=
Queen's Biggest Beneficiary: Oh My Girl
=
You can criticize the stage, but don't make fun of it by grabbing and biting each of the Lovelyz groups and members.
Criticism, criticism and ridicule are quite different ...
In another video, Lovelyz is a badly made group. Isn't this a criticism or just a denial of the group itself?
Looking at the recent events, I think you've been angered by the numerous malignant comments that have caused sorrow, mourning, and the cause of His death. So please remember that case and don't be ridiculed any more than criticism. I've been seeing my brain wandering all the time by watching (not criticizing) mocking comments and malignant comments on Lovelyz's recommendation videos ... Please don't criticize mocking comments. Please
=
Lovelyz It's been hard because of this, but sometimes he has a lot of bad guys;
=
It's a stage that shows how great Beagirl was. First of all, I can't follow Brea Girl's unique skill and sexyness, but it's from Lovelyz who only went innocent.
=
It's like the kids pretending at school are dancing at the festival. It's worse than that ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Did you only have to interpret the song; At the same time, the number of surges seems to save my eyes and emotions
=
I don't seem to understand the concept.
=
Oh my song
If you catch the chance you wanted or didn't want
I should have used it ...
It seems that the interpretation of the song itself is too poor.
=
Everyone, we've got a comeback confirmed article in October. Please spread it out. I'll let you know when it's rice cake with Six Sense. (Okay, please.) Please wait a minute!!
=
Blasphemy
=
They should have saved their strengths, but they're ruined by looking for a girl crush unconditionally.
=
I was already expecting it as soon as I heard the first part of it. No surprise ... I've been out of tune with the song since the beginning. ... I don't really understand what I'm talking about with my group, I just hang around with a nice concept of the anti-crush girl crush. Why do you want to show off your neck? I'm trying to focus on it, but Yoo Ji-ae and Jeong-in are very busy, and the other groups have done a great job as if the concept or arrangement is a different song, but they don't know what's changed in the original song.
=
It's like a stage prepared by trainees in a producer ...
There's no fun, no tension, no expectation .... Why did you push the pure-pure concept from your company all the time?
=
Lovelyz is just innocent .. I can't sing well and I can't leave without it. TT TT This song doesn't seem to be too much to do ..
=
I want everyone to watch K stage here. I thought Queendom was Lovelyz, but I just misunderstood the concept a lot.
(I'm not a fan, but I'm sorry that I think it's too low)
https://youtu.be/O7RvZrfxzsw
=
The dance skills are so low compared to other groups .. Lovelyz is so flapping? When it pops ㅠㅠㅠ When the hand is raised, no timing, no strength and weakness ... Debut 5 years. TT
=
More than anything
There seems to be a lack of understanding of songs.Each member has a different facial expression and a different expression.
=
Wink and sleepy
=
The concept that was a girl, just to follow
But nothing better than B-girl,
If you've chosen this song, you know how important vocals are, seeing you sing hard, you've been ridiculous, you don't know what you're good at.
=
I think we know why Lovelyz has gone from the debut to the innocent concept. It's just the worst
It's been a problem for the hit song, but I've touched the sixth sense.
=
Umm..Lovelyz has been so eager to have a sexy concept .. But why does it feel like this?
=
Honestly, the other cover songs didn't come to mind so much, but I listened to them so I wanted to hear the version of Beagirl too;
=
Honestly, I think I should be sorry for Beagirl ... Beagirl members are hitting me .. I think they did it.
=
Why do you keep winking? I couldn't interpret the song ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I can't be tamed and wink ㅋㅋ I saw the first measure and surprise ㅋㅋ If you look at the original song, the pop part is like the head of the beast
=
The other part is that the most important refrain is ruined. It's not like the Lovelyz main vocals can't sing, but it feels like it doesn't fit. Kay, too, can't help vocals singing beautifully with aesthetic voices. I wouldn't have gotten this bad if I sang this song for Girls' Generation Rundevil or Hoop, Kara Lupine, Jumping.
=
Kay's Paap ~ Paap ~ It's so funny and addictive that I come to see it.
=
I would rather be able to express Oh My Girl with fireworks or something like this.
=
The comments are really ridiculous. What do you think you're doing now? No, it's violent. Comments like you gather to kill a person.
=
It's K-pole.
=
Kay's 'Paap ~!'
You're powerful when you break down B-girl
=
This is ... Hamsters are cute even if they want to be sexy.
=
Clearing Up Raking Issues
0. Just curved curve is a problem. Not just hanging out with Lovelyz, but too much of B'Agal
1. It's obvious, but a long intro without impact. Steam is leaking here
2. Vocals that don't go with the song. Yoo Ji-ae, Kay, and the bibliographic tones when singing are especially bad.
3. Different interpretations. Some are cute, some are laughing, some are intense, some are winking. Bad facial expression.
4. Pahab ~ ♡
5. True treatment by lowering an octave of whistle on the bridge.
6. Arrangement is not much different from the original
7. Eat Lemon Too Good
=
Um! Width! Feet!
=
My sister was eating at home,
=
However, because of this stage, sixth sense karaoke chart is broken. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's more than this, it's like a bro girl, four minutes, Hyuna, trouble maker, mom, and three hours passed
=
I'm glad that Ryu Soo-jung is in the role of Cain
=
I thought Cain was good at singing.
I didn't know how to make this song so good.
It's not like a girl idol legend!
=
The kids are also on the air because they are forced to do well ...
=
I still don't understand why Kay kissed me.
=
04:26 Park Bom It's really creepy and so foolish
=
Even if the concept is wrong and the stage is not good, let's not swear by the group itself or members individually.
=
I'd rather do the Abraham Cadabra, which can be easily followed even by the melody line.
=
One person coming to see the reaction and comments
Shuhwa, I'm scared ~
=
3:46 Cute to be crazy
=
2:59 Mimi's face
=
2:39 Am I the only bodyguard? ㅋㅋㅋ I saw this bodyguard aoa when I was on stage ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Honestly addictive crazy lol
This is worse than a grade
=
3:38 No, Mi-yeon is scared of revising and watching.
=
4:54 Didn't you get a fire reaction when the girls came out?
=
It would have been cooler if Mamamu did
=
I have a fire reaction funny 3:54
=
4:53 This part Park Bom Reaction Children firestage
It's a reaction, Reaction Jatanglas
=
It's funny and I'm coming to see you hahahaha
=
To be honest, I expected ruin as soon as I heard the selection.
=
I wish I could have done something like a closure
=
I'm looking at the stage of Lovelyz but I can't concentrate on because I was so pretty.
=
I just heard B-girl
Is this a quiet, quiet, soft, impactless song?
I really don't know what I'm listening to;
=
Is this the place where you do well?
=
1 beagirl who stayed still
=
If you hear this, you won't forget ^
=
Come in to think of girls
=
How many winks?
Well, everyone is pretty but ...
=
Sounds like a wind falls in the lungs
=
By the way, did they suddenly have six senses? Isn't it a principle to sing oh my girl?
=
You have been to Lotte World ???
=
Difficult to hear with earphones
=
But what is Hueng Yyes ... in 0:49? I don't know what the lyrics are
=
Every time I see you, I'm too burdened ...
=
I wanted to see the original song ...
=
Live
=
Aiko ...
=
Kay Wink and Sonkiss are not real;
=
It's been a while since it's been a long time ~ But when I listened to B-girl again and listened to this again, why is it so empty?
=
ㅎㅇ
=
If I wanted to gall, I would have chewed on Tiara cry cry or F (x) red light.
Why did you choose Six Senses?
There's a reason why young girls don't cover Six Sense.
=
Are you a celebrity?
=
Oh my girl's closure or the secret garden of the 5th season song selection and innocence or dream dreams if you had a concept like that would have been much better,
=
3:46 3:46
Who are you following mein?
You are so cute
=
The concept is that the index is better.
=
But accompaniment ... Why is accompaniment? Did you put it on purpose? Why is it so empty ??? The original song is magnificent, so it looks more comparable; Did you say your voice would be too loud?
=
Kei sister voice is so good
=
4:49 I think I've seen this facial contest in Achu, too.
=
But I don't think it's a bit too much.
I'm also a fan and I've seen a comment saying that on the V app, but I don't know the details, but I recently suicide was also suicide ㅠㅠ Now I want to know what is wrong with those members ..
=
Sergei pulled up a little, but Kay grabbed him down.
=
I think I can't do that concept but I can't do it.
=
Ah, if you look at this, the recommendation list is crazy.
3:33 I'm going to let you go
This bag (?
4:17 Treble first
The rest of you know
...
Ah ~~
suddenly
Ah ~~~
While gel confident
4:45 Paap ♡
Um, yes
=
3:45 Kim Joe Meow
=
Lovelyz is going to be good if you push the high treble. Why do you insist on K. Voice is pretty but lacks a cool taste, something is lacking.
=
Comments Do you feel anything so sweet?
What you guys do is the same as the Axler ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
A world that's freaked out only by young girls ;;;
=
In the comments on the official Lovelyz official grammar, the fans are clumsy, but if the members believe that way and continue to do what they think, it's a moment that collapses quickly. It's been a few years since my debut, but if I'm still good enough, my company has sent it out to the program. Lots of other good rookie trainees.
=
All other group members look like this
ㅇㅂㅇ
=
Kay's palpable walk through the garden that Ryu Soo-jeong has made and walks through the city! ~ ❤️
=
I made a leaf cake, and the loaf cake-colored fresh cream cake was delivered in a leaf cake plastic container. I'm going to see the owner of the song.
=
Kay's so fixated on pretty things.
I think Jisoo and America are very charismatic.
=
Stop the bad guys
=
Lovelyz is just too sad to see ... I'd rather not participate in the Queendom.
=
I'm doing well ... Lovelyz
=
At the same time, Ryu Soo-jung is the best person to digest Cainpart .. ㅋ POP ㅋㅋㅋ ̈̈ ̆̎ ㅋ ̊̈ ㅋ ̌̈ ㅋ ̄̈ ㅋ ̐̈ ㅋ ̑̈ ㅋ ̆̈ I'd rather sing a song .. even if you give me a chance to pick a song.
=
What's the children's school? Ha ha ha
=
I feel sorry for the baby's face, how hard it would be to hear the covers of his songs, though he might have worked hard despite his leg injuries.
=
Baby Soul vocals would have been much better if you used them well.
=
The members are only thinking about getting close when they close up ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㄱ
=
For some, the current idol's fault is that it's important not to understand the original song itself
Textbook of the state
=
Phaphaang ~
=
‘What happens if you have untrusted confidence’
=
Lovelyz is developing so nice
=
You guys are still mocking ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
But it's not like this Heungheung ?? It's only me, it's my tattoo noodle
=
When Kay sings pop, everything feels good before.
=
~~~
=
I keep coming in this video .. to see the comments .. As soon as the video comes in, he stops.
=
Oh my girl would have expected Lovelyz to cover their songs. I didn't know that on the day because the crew didn't tell me that the song was changed in advance. I think I'm upset. I'm upset.
In the meantime, when you see Oh My Girl Destiny on stage, you are surprised and delighted that we should sing our song. Ha ha ha
And the Americas don't really have the same courtesy. The concept is the same. There are a lot of songs.
But at first, the crystal is a lot of sources that can arrange the fireworks, and after a positive opinion of the song when the right to change the knee knee reaction .. ㅋㅋㅋ
In the third round of the unit, the individual skills are fine, but the Black Achu and Lubbs Sense results are not subjective to what they do well until the fifth year ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Lovelyz It's like Namira's winners who feel like they're going to battle. Should I follow the original song? Feeling happy to win while popping champagne. I'm fine with this arrangement.
=
Video that shows why you sweared
=
Don't swear in real life
=
Paap ~ (break!)
=
The crew has a problem playing with Benefit, but it seems to be a problem with Lovelyz's insufficiency.
Even the pure innocence concept can be interpreted differently by changing the angle
If you were to sing a Beagirl, you could select and digest a song like my style that suits your color.
We are confident in the vocals >> Just follow the B-girl with the simple idea of ​​letting the dolphin popping Six Senses.
These guys think I need to learn the strategy of Soonyeon or Oh My Girl trying to play other girl group songs.
=
I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Wow ... this is the worst cover song lately;
Still, she thanked her juniors for calling her ...
=
Why does Kay keep doing fairy gestures? I can't see it because of its anti-magical power .. Seo Ji-soo is the center that Bae Yoon-jung was astonished.
=
I'm scared of damping the beat itself
=
3:34 No matter how much Seo Ji-soo said he was good at interpreting the gel, but he didn't interpret it very well.
=
I didn't know why this is so
But I saw Beerah girl
No way
=
But I can't really do it but your voice is so thin ㅋㅋ No thick, husky girl
=
No ... We had four Bhagals filling the stage like that ...?
I will not swear Lovelyz who do not understand the concept and cannot digest it. Why can't I have lower jabs and stats than Beagirl? But pop ... Who would have put in some direc ... It's obvious that the producer and the engineer themselves misunderstood the song. How can I just let the pop of the aesthetic so arranged?
=
By the way, fans seem to have decided to cuty, but I'll expect it .... I heard the original song.
Pop! I need to strengthen this Pa-ap This is not high treble
=
Six Senses and Lovelyz are a terrible hybrid.
I don't understand the concept of bibliography
=
Still, Ji-su Su's got me a cup.
=
Replying to @RussianSurvey
=
4:54 in the idol?
=
If it's called Paap, it's like this
=
4:26 Park Bom What does that mean?
=
4:26 Park Bom I don't have a soul ㅋㄹㅋㄹ ㅋㅅ ㅋㄱ ㅋㄹ ㅋㄹㅋㄹ ㅋㄹㅋㄹ ㅋㄹㄹ ㅋㄹㅋㄹ ㅋㄹㅋㄹ ㅋㄹㅋㄹ ㅋㅇ ㅋㄹㅋ ㅅㅋㄹ ㅋㅇㄹ ㅋㄹㅋㄹ ㄹ ㅋㄹ ㅋㄹㅋ
=
One hundred dancers behind the song best understood
=
2:46 It's funny that only I am in the middle of Park Bom. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
0:28 Is it Bom Park?
=
"Forever" for other reasons
=
Bae Yoon Jung: (Static)
=
This stage should be listened with earphones
I can hear you better
=
Ryu Soojung goes well with the rest of the song .... the rest of the songs don't go with this song.
=
Cody is amazing. Even before the song came out, it looks like Six Sense.
=
1:18 That was all right
1:36 Here too
1:45 break
Window
K? I think elegant suits
=
How are all the vocals and dances so cute and innocent? Only really cute kids
=
Guys, that's not it
=
4:36 Lee Mangi
=
It's hard to sing this song like this
=
Stop it now ... man could be.
=
I think Bae Yoon-jung was at Beagirl Six Sense.
=
It's so bizarre and swearing that I'm looking for Lovelyz videos. As I wrote below, it was a group that consumed a lot of ses pinky images. Decadent and dark is hardly anything. Looking forward to the next stage and cheering. The most supportive idol these days is the Mammu side of the Queendom. In the past, the Pinkle Cover, or bright enough, it's an excellent group.
=
2:12 I didn't know what Suh Ji Soo's expression looked like.
=
Bae Yoon Jung: Do you want Kay Pop?
=
2:59 Mimi's face = my face
=
Meme ❤️ 3:46
=
The kids you can't have reason for.
=
I feel that this video report is a group of vocals, dancing and digesting images that are just made to digest concepts like s.e.s. s.e.s is not a song without power. It's just too dark and doesn't mix with this dark and deep concept.
=
Why do you use your face like that?
=
I'd rather kill killville.
=
I'd rather go with the song.
=
Stop laughing at me, just as I commented below, let's just say 1. Constructive criticism?
=
0:42 So what did you expect this to be a terrible hybrid?
=
Just .. suddenly anxious to come, but please criticize, but don't over ridicule .. I'm not a good friend, and the friends who have been singing hard and can't do it once .. You know, it's a horse
=
October 28, Be A Girl Comeback ~
=
This song won't wink
"I will kill you even if the eyeballs are pulled out." Should feel
=
What are you doing there?
=
I'm good at Lovelyz ~ I hope it will be better in the future
=
4:07 Gracia ~
=
Thank you for your interest in the cover stage going on for about a month ^ ^ I'm criticizing the comments you leave ~ ㅋㅋ Please think about it
Didn't you see and feel the Sully Affliction case yesterday?
You guys are all four nets. Stop it.
=
The youngest celebrity makes up for it alone.
=
Yoo Ji-ae's baby voice + Jeong Ye-in's Korean book pronunciation + Kay's pretty chuck is not too much surged than Cola's cola, but it looks like that, but it's just because he lacks his skills. If you gave me a Papa member, you wouldn't have heard that much. And what kind of part of Kay can't touch her head? Seriously
=
Why do you keep winking?
=
It's the most powerful and powerful song ever, and it's the same song and concept that it's like. It's a level of blasphemy about the original song.
=
Pahab ~
=
I wasn't the only one who felt that way ... I could have shown a whole new look with the song of Om girl. I don't know why I'm in a hurry to get away from this innocence. I think I'm just trying to get out of innocence. Like Achu and this sixth sense .. This expression has a cute expression of baby's voice. What's lovely about Lovelyz's identity is innocence. Is there anything that doesn't fit into the mold that doesn't fit?
=
Lovelyz seems to be too much of a song to digest. Just because clothes and facial expressions are similar to sexy and girl are not really like that. Now every member feels like playing separately. Lovelyz seems to have to start with their analysis first.
=
It's really our OMG girl cover song, but they're so sad and upset that they don't have a song. I'm so good and I'm so nice and tearful. I was so used to seeing Hyojung crying in the last secret garden. Idols, ready-made people, well-deserved people who are well worth it.
=
This is just .... singing dance skills not like this, but the overall production is not good .... ㅠㅠ
Idol who can only do it, stage planning, strategy, song analysis, etc. are inferior to other groups.
+)) Towing Personal Stage Report
The personal stage was very fresh and good ~ The sad part of this stage was that they just came out of the decision making process and the towing performance stage was really nice. .haha
=
It's a lot of people because of the voting points. It's scary people.
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ 아진 짴 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Song interpretation, I understood the concept aside.
=
Amnet edited by an angel?
When I was producing, I edited Dulty like that
=
I'm trying to focus on vocals in Cayenne. Why the cabbage is so limited ... The tone is so limited, but in the pure innocence, K looks good, but at least in this song, Xavi must have been Jin or Crystal. I just don't play with the songs.
=
Please stop this and get mentally ill.
=
Why would you try to keep the clothes that suit you well and keep on keeping suiting your clothes? There are a few teams specialized in the girl crush sexy concept and performance in Queendom. It would have been .. I don't understand how to escape the image or try new things, but I've turned away from Lovelyz's own color twice.
It would have been much appreciated if I had arranged a song like Closure or the fifth season in the song of Oh My Girl with the lovely feelings of Lovelyz
=
I've been watching Lovelyz V App. To be honest, it seems like you're trying to win. It's also a process as if you're a SAT? Growth should have been a trainee;
And how would you be happy with the Six Senses stage? I didn't ask you that;
If the fans are satisfied with the Instagram, he said, stop it.
A feast of true horseback spirit; The stage was disappointing, but after that, the attitude of Lovelyz was more serious. It's like living in a fantasy group.
=
You're really pure.
=
The stage was also unfortunate, but a little rude I think .. Lovelyz had an omg hit song still remaining, but omg girl did not have a hit song, Achu, but even more difficult situation focused on showing their colors. The concept is the same all the time, saying that it's going to be 6th if you sing OHM Girl. And I'm so excited as I've been changing the songs. This doesn't mean he's hitting the sixth sense he picked up ...
=
Omgirl was a pity when I laughed to see if you should be professional or good .. ㅠ
=
I'm sorry, but I think Lovelyz's concept overlaps with them, so I'm trying to align my identity with Queendom. Why don't Lovelyz try to beat their concept ...

Did you do well? It's nice to hear, but it's better than putting it as a beggar.
=
Shake well ~
=
Colfaap ~
=
But I keep seeing this
=
K Paab ~ seems like a black history, like a Junkei goat.
=
I look back, but seeing the back dancer is more fun.
=
The 30 seconds that B-girl showed for a while from my older brother are more impressive ..
=
How did you feel about this stage
I think it was a stage pretending to be pretty
To be honest, I only think about this
Isn't this wild and wild?
The makeup is pretending to be Everland and pretending to be pretty.
=
This video is going to be a holy place
=
Oh my girl should have chosen a song to show the innocence of all ages ... I hoped to let the public know that the two groups have different lines of innocence.
=
LOL
=
Aside from K Paap, Baby Vox Paap
=
You're habitually winking .....
=
I'm rather a banana allergic monkey.
=
Journalists Don't mention this when you're at a comeback showcase.
=
I can't go beyond the original story.
=
Bae Yoonjung: Kay, do you want to be Pop?
=
No. If you look at the camera, you'll have a hand kiss, wink, and the camera says, "If you look at this camera, have a hand kiss or wink?"
=
I don't mix the sound board when I sing a pop
Can't you call me a little harder?
It's uncomfortable to see me alone
=
Needlessly Intro
=
I keep seeing you ...
=
Why do I keep coming to see this ...
=
3:46 You help me so much.
=
But it's addictive and keeps coming in because it's addictive.
=
I came to see girls
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ At first, Park Bom ... Jung really
Spring's face is all right
=
I have to sing this song powerfully.
Why do you think I'm going to call you all but a few?
3:47 I think he's the best. It's awkward.
=
After coordination: Coordination completion!
After the stage: ㅅ 꾸 I decorated like this?

=
4:26 It's really creepy

=
2:42 Why are you with your lips? You're not like that or you're sticking out like a duck?
=
Lovelyz .. The Americas are too close .. Please come out ..

This video comes out when you crush or crush it on Youtube

AOA expression is internal
=
There must have been a reason

This is a dog song ㅋㅋㅋ ... But this is not a pretty voice

I can't really feel it

=
Except for one or two.
=
ㅎㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ
=
3:35 big .. ;;
=
Ah .. ㅅㅂ Listening to the original song and listen to this is frustrating ;; It's a real song miss.
=
1:21
Original here
Even though I look at you from a distance
=
Jean is so sexy !!
=
앜 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This is addictive but I keep seeing it
=
I know what it is and it comes every time I get on the feed.
=
Is this an addictive wink?
=
Uh, it's important to reinterpret the song, but it's too comparable to the original song because I used the coordination and the song.
=
If you're going to be sexy, Ryu Soo-jung, Ji-soo, Lee promised
=
I've heard rumors from the can. Haha !!
=
It was okay until 58 seconds.
=
Come and see your baby! 3:40 It's scary!
=
Everyone .. If you see this video for the first time, go out now ............. I started here and went to the Girls' Generation debut stage ..... ㄹ
=
Really not good
=
What did I see now?
=
What's wrong with you?
=
One line summary
Feeling missing milk in a cafe latte
=
4:26 What does Park Bom's creepy mean?
=
Your sister said no to riding grounds?
If you look at the stage of Six Senses
=
I saw it again ..
=
4:54 Is it Minny Parton in the children's fire? Isn't it the same as following that part?
=
Reeshan is more funny,
=
You're listening to this and all the other music is boring.
=
kei pops well
=
Ryu Soo-jung? I think he's good at the gel concept.
=
I don't think it's bad
I just thought that Six Senses was reinterpreted and arranged in a novel, cute, pretty and lovely way with Lovelyz style.
Just a lot of novelty ;;;;;;
=
I can't sing. Look at the last high-pitched voices. But even AR AR ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ It's not really a legendary song.
=
Recruit, retribute your life or live hard.
I'm working on a one-off stage.
=
The index is clear.
=
Ha ha ha
=
Kei's voice. Wink, etc. Gesture, but who keeps anesthesia on his face, there's no facial expression, so there's no charisma every time you look at the part. None I like this concept is also hard to look at the immiju, but after coming out of the end of the end can feel more relative, but the face is pure innocent, but there is no soul seems to hate to do .... ㅠ
=
When you hit Lovelyz, the first thing that comes out is Lovelyz Six Sense.
=
Park Bom and the children won this stage, no matter how much they think, it's a hell
=
Looks like a lot more than necessary
Now stop the man behind the monitor.
=
Lovelyz I originally wanted to listen to the concept song
=
Blank pop
=
Isco seems to be playing Drogba.
=
I'm really curious, why did Lovelyz sing a song that wasn't in the cover?
=
But the more you see, the better ...
=
ㅎ
=
Comments Do you feel anything so sweet?
What you guys do is the same as the Axler ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
A world that's freaked out only by young girls ;;;
=
Lovelyz couldn't cover her in two weeks
Lovelyz just touched the sanctuary.
=
Hey, guys, this song should have been called with the power to split your cramps ... It's like a balloon that's too windy, it's powerless, and it sounds like a sound.
=
Oh, at least the Papa Papa should have been shared only with the three 벱 Sol Ryu Su Jin, but the high pitched sound is so soft that the K high is not a high pitched sound.
=
What's that thin Papa Papa?
I'm sorry. The voice is so pretty ... I do a song to save vocals
=
I'm terribly sorry ... but worse than BlackArch ;; It's a cover but it's a contest
I don't know what it is, but I feel a rush to reproduce the original song ... The vocal side doesn't really say anything but visually, it doesn't fit except modification.
=
Except for Ryu Soo Jung, the voice is not very good with the song.
=
The concept overlaps, but the two concepts are quite different .. Lovelyz is a strong diary showing a girl's diary Oh My Girl feels like a fairy tale story. ㅔ
=
I have more to say than rap.
But if you watched the stage with Kay Hwa, you did well. Why are you here?
=
But I think it's a selection error. This song is very impressive when I pop it.
=
Two minutes and five seconds of Park Bom Reaction and Lovely's Six Sense Version about four minutes and 55 seconds on Idle Fire Version on Queen's Youth Crazy; I was dancing 2NE1 Fire, but I also put it in the Lovelyz video,
=
I first heard a song called Six Senses here and I just wanted to sing this song, but because I listened to the original song, China 넼 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Some other participants reinterpreted the existing songs and changed the concept to suit their group.Lovelyz brought all the clothes, concept, atmosphere, and choreography of Six Sense. Only adds intros and danves to their sixth sense
=
If Kay is a top-ranked mebo, he's going to have to rub his hair on the asphalt.
=
Oh my girl reaction sincere so it hurts
=
This is not a song that laughs at all. I don't think I saw the original stage.
=
3:40 Why are you so scared? Are you fucking Meg?
=
I think I have to do a lot of music study ... I look up a lot of materials, monitor, study concepts a lot, and I also refer to a lot of overseas singers' stages to know what they are good at and what are their strengths. It's not going to happen in the morning, but ... Change or hire someone who is responsible for the idea concept.
=
Didn't you see the original song?
=

Did you decide to be Meg?
=
I think so.
That's because most of the audience didn't listen to the original song.
If not, how can you beat Park Bom and the children?
Or ... Amnet ...
=
Nobody's going to dry this stage.
=
But how do you change the one from the beginning to the end ... The song and the dance are all the same ... Are there any members who have the ability to arrange arrangements or dances?
=
Babel: ??? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ What is this?
=
The back dancer was best understood.
=
It's so funny to try to tell a good thing ..
=
4:57 Behind the back dancers acting better
=
It's not enough. I'm going to grow up with this machine. It's not that I'm trying to have fun with my fans. ㅋㅋ I'm sorry. It's a judgment error until the end. ㅋ There are a few members.
=
I don't know the number of Lovelyz members, but I think it would be better to form only members without dancers. No spirit, no impact, no voice, no power ㅡ ㅡ
=
The genres these girls are best at
'Kpop'
=
I thought it was a stage for a minute
=
I believe that we will be a further developing group !! Everyone grows while learning !!
So please don't say more than ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ degrees ㅎㅎㅎ You can get hurt
=
It would have been better for Baby Soul or Jin to do this than Pop.
And the last treble part should have been changed.

=
It's so funny to read the comments, but the video ends, so I always watch it again
=
4:29
I think I know what Soyeon thinks so I'm more embarrassed
=
Kay hand ... so much magical power ...
=
It's okay though
Misu Ryu
=
3:46 Meow
=
This video comes out even if I search by Paap ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Your face looks at 3:38
Neverland knows that you don't normally do that?
=
It was the last stage of the Lovelyz concert.
=
It doesn't look very well but it's strangely attractive .. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Please get in Rain's car.
=
K Originally, the treble and voice itself are clear like beads, so it doesn't go well with Six Sense. I can't sing .. "Paap ~!"
The original song is hard hitting and going up, but this time it's kind of annoying ... 쪕
=
The k-part is letting the heat brush ...
=
LOL
=
1:42 breaking

* Wave ~ hop ♡ *

Only the first part was good

I'm seeing B-girl again and I'm stuck in the memory loop.

I'll see you again soon ~ ♡♡ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Papa ♡
=
No matter how I improved it, I wouldn't have sweared this much.
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ While listening to the introduction, it's just okay.
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ While I was preparing the song, did you not understand the concept? Are you kidding me ?? The overall perfection was too low and it was a lovely crush, but I really broke it.
=
The choreography is so sexy because of the sixth sense?
=
I don't want to kiss my yellow hair
=
The surge number here is the best match for this concept.
=
What's so different? What's this?
=
I'm done, call me to you in Queendom.
=
Stop winking ...
=
The only child that suits you is the Americas.
=
Seo Ji-soo only works well
=
Every day to see the introduction of Ryu Sujeong
=
Why do eagles in the Americas Gracia?
=
Isn't it really me?
=
Don't follow B.A. Girl Class without Klastlim.
=
I want to go to Lovelyz, but I'm being denied to this stage How do I do this?
=
The best bibliography is the best
=
The song is a war song, and you want to surrender the enemy with the son kiss, smile, and wink?
=
I haven't seen it yet. I'm ashamed of just commenting:
=
Even if the concept doesn't fit
I don't think I understand the song at all
What are the passers-by shielding this one? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Is it bad that you can't do it?
=
See you again
=
I think I just understood the index.
=
This is a crazy subtitle
=
No
https://youtu.be/h8qqt0xddk4 This is from 3 minutes and 7 seconds and I can't understand why Kay called it with that tone.
=
K ... why do you keep on winking?
=
Isn't it like Lovelyz and Mama debut year? But I can't understand the concept more than Mamamu and 1 year old children.
=
It 's been a month since this stage, and the comments are crazy.
=
Lovelyz Destiny seized for two years
=
✨Birgirl sisters comeback on October 28th ✨
=
To summarize: just take this chance and cover what you want to do
=
Honestly, there are very few comments here. But I think they'll take it as bad.
=
Papa without malt ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The stage where I was so curious about why I decided to be Six Senses
=
I wasn't a Lovelyz fan, but in the meantime, I'm dying. I didn't think the ringing could work. I'm sorry.
=
I can't hide the waiting room reactions by editing .... lol
=
I think there's a problem because the voice and the song don't fit well.
=
Wow! Really tough and tough. Lupley fans, you just shield with diamonds. They say that it doesn't match theirs, but the weather gets cold soon. I feel like I'm nervous, I'm cold, my whole body is trembling, but I'm going to lose weight.
=
This is the 4th place
Park Bom, I'm laughing for 4 kids
=
Yoo Jiae really hahahaha
=
It's funny that Hyejung smashes when the reaction is caught. Is it representing the viewers' mind? LOL 3:03, 4:46
=
Lovelyz-Don't think about your strengths and focus on changing the image. But it doesn't really focus on interpretation of the song, so it's literally no more than a cover song.
I didn't do this stage, and I'm not incompetent, but it wasn't arranged by the feeling of Lovelyz but it's far less than the original song.
Oh My Girl-Because I have my own thoughts, I know what kind of stage I need to take advantage of my strengths to get the best stage. So she interprets the songs as she feels and makes a perfect Oh My Girl stage.
The reason why I compare it with Oh My Girl is that the two groups would have similar problems anyway when the two groups swapped each other.
But oh my girl, will this song go like this? How do you feel about that song? I like this song. This is our advantage, so let's take advantage of this. In this way, I tried to make a good stage by adding my own strengths to the strengths of the opposing team's songs. The result was the best stage.
But Lovelyz has a similar concept, which is likely to come in sixth.
It seemed to be absent (the two groups are not a matter of being friendly) and the stage itself had no strategy at all. If Lovelyz had a contest with Oh My Girl, they would have been able to achieve their high scores if they had really interpreted their strengths, charms, and interpretations of the song correctly. I don't know why you think your rank is low when you sing Oh My Girl. Why do you think there's no match in the color of Lovelyz? I know that I wanted to do something different, but I didn't consider my strengths at all and changed my image.
Like I said, I wish I couldn't do the sixth sense. But it wasn't just Sixth Sense, but Beagirl didn't show enough ability to erase it, so it was only comparable to Beagirl.
What was Lovely Six's Sixth Sense?
The original song was really powerful and proud, and if it was sexy, it was also sexy
In the beginning, it was difficult to handle this song with the thin tone and vocals of Yu Ji-ae, elite, and Seo Ji-su. But I didn't arrange for the members.
(It's hard to arrange this song like that in the first place.)
And I can't think of a wink or gesture in the middle that this song is not interpreted at all.
So I just changed the image of the group
The merits of the group, the members' individual vocals, their skills, and the interpretation of the songs were not considered at all.
Those features are compared and mentioned to Oh My Girl who decided to sing each other in the contest.
Since 2011, when it was called the Ullim Girl Group, there was a lot of interest in this group.
I know very well that I want to change the concept, but to do so, I think it's really good to think about your strengths, attractiveness, and strategic stage composition.
=
Huxol and Jin were so housed ... They were more powerful vocals than K. I wonder why they didn't leave the pop to them.
=
Why does Lovelys do sixth sense that no one wants to touch? ... Even if Mamamu is going to ... Hmm ... Papa ~ ♡ Paap ~ ♡ Do you want to last? Ao Ana Park Bom Mamamu I don't have any words ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The temperature difference between Kay and Seo Ji Soo is so great ... only Su Ji Soo understands the original song. Kay laughs and sings.
=
Look at the AOA look. LOL's professional and AOA's getting better. When I pop, I'm Kim Pak .... Ryu Sujeong and Izu and Baby Soul? I think you've done the best. How
=
Lovelyz image I want to break away from the concept of girl crush and hard and motivated I know well, but I feel like I'm not catching the pint ㅠㅠ It would be nice to show the girl crush while showing their colors.
=
Why the hell are you doing sixth sense? I was surprised because I wasn't so hot, and visually, America was the best suited. Why did you choose a song that doesn't suit your singing ability or group identity? I watched nervously all the time ..... And Naver commented it was me too. I'm all over
=
No, I really don't understand why they're not.
The only thing you can do behind the scenes
=
I feel like Oh My Girl.
=
It looks like a wild drawing of a few wounds with a make-up on my face ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ To reveal all the skin and not one at all .... I don't have any charisma. Regretful
=
No. PLUS sixth sence What do you do if you give this part to Yuji Ae ... This sexy and the part we need to give a feeling like this is we're just a babe We're just in love ~ ☆ Hehe ~ ♡
=
How much do you think kids don't cook?
=
Every time I see the audience, I'm surprised because it's the same as otaku.

Uh, I just leaned back from the beginning
=
At least ideal part allocation
Main vocal: Baby Soul (Refraction full / don't even have malt and P ☆ P !!!!!!!
Lead vocal: Ryu Soo-jeong (Gain part / song feeling, but if the bass part quality noise Gain is Starbucks espresso, this could be Idiya Americano taste.)
Main Rapper: Seo Ji-soo (Single Rap / Bass, I just wished I had a solo, but I had analytical + ambition + facial expressions + clip, so ah ... Lovelyz, I could save as much as Seo Ji-su. )
Subvocal 1: Lee Mi-joo (Narsha Part 1 / Sweat drops on your thirsty face) If you take it personally, you feel tall because you are tall.
Sub vocals 2 elites (Narsha Part 2 / The touch you have ...) Um .. I admit that I'm a face madam. But assuming there is no pretend ... This is a rare case that is a strange sound all plus plus in terms of height and externality. In fact, without the visual maintenance.
Subvocal 3: Jin (Verse 2 Bridge Part, Last Part / Better Than a Love Motion) The eye itself is weak and the voice is a little loose, so the pitch itself is good for ventilation. nicety.
Sub vocal 4: Yoo Ji-ae (Verse 1 Bridge Part / popping good pay ..) I really worried a lot. First of all, this song is very upbeat .. Ugh .. But rather than using an avocal voice in the bass, the part that could hear and fly in the mid / high part would have been fine.)
Guest: Treble: K (힛 하 / / haha ​​~~~~~~~ / Treble: Should have focused on this part. The voice itself is light, so it does not match this song at all. But the treble is well drawn and it is better to store the power. .)

Overall comment: Lovelyz is not suitable for power or sexy tone. However, semi-sexy is possible if the atmosphere is mainly tones such as the temperature of LABOUM. And there are a lot of members who have the voice tone of the upper part, so it can be well harmonized. In addition, physical is a play and a play, so if small members want to have a power concept, they should be prepared for the tall immigrant who is ready to go out of the ankle. Looking at the dance line, Nine Muses honestly feels like a baby girl in a fan meeting because it was physical superiority. And the rap part member is Baby Soul, but the main vocals go to the vocal cords, so the bass members Ji-soo Su and Lee Mi-joo have to work hard.
Lovelyz to look at
High soprano
(Aesthetic)
K (the high-pitched stability semi-vocal method, so it's definitely the top but it's a little unpleasant because of the nasal sound)
Yoo Ji-ae (Just a baby's voice. Ventilating voice. It may be licorice to someone, but it may seem like an irritating determinant to someone. .)
Mezzo Soprano
Baby Soul (If you look at the tone, the high-alto in the mid-range is also a scam rap that's good for the bass and treble soon.) It's a bit unfortunate that there aren't many songs in Lovez that are musically matched to Baby Soul.)
Jin (Myeongeun has a stable high pitched sound in the mid range, but the sound is loosely husky in the bass, and the voice tone is unstable due to the vocal cords released from the treble. You'll need to build more stamina and practice more breathing, so the tone will be cooler.)
Lee Mi-ju (I was surprised. Instinctively, the sound is tight. Actually, the voice itself can be heard as a bass sound, but it has a stable and powerful body that has the ability to be used in the mid-to-low range. The visuals are so noticeable that the voices sound normal, and because of the personality, I sometimes get excited and the voices are bouncing.
Mid (high alto)
Yein (Sometimes when I see Yee's voice, I have no feelings, because it comes out of the pitch of the knife, which is exactly the same calculation as Imizu. Strangely, it's just mid-range. The pitch is accurate, the voice is very even, and the slow tone is applied to the song. .)
Bass (alto)
Ryu Soo Jung (Actually, I'm surprised because I'm so good at this. Idol Husky voice friends with a good tone. It's good to listen. As the tone is eaten, the volume tone is bigger and more unique to K Baby Soul.
Bass (Contralto)
Seo Ji-soo (Singing ability objectively compared to other members. I sometimes saw a lower part than Yu Jiae because of the bass too much. It's very heavy and the other members go down to iced tea and badly caramel macchiato, but it's espresso alone, I think it's the dark horse of Lovelyz. I don't like the elements, I want to be more confident, and all Lovelyz fans like Jisoo !. Finally, the mid and high tone using the nasal sound is like a cat and mystery. Catch it.)
=
It's also a colorful light
=
This stage is like the time when I saw a friend named Lee Won-jun suddenly make a heart on his head while calling his bloody tears.
=
Ryu Soo-jung keeps on with Cain's part
=
If it was this song, at least this stage would not have been evaluated as a shit.
But the problem is that there are original songs ... at least cover, or even if they were the songs of their choice, you need to respect them. I just covered it with the color of the centipede, but I'm not totally concerned about the original song. Why would the company not give permission when they were obsessed? It's a style that I've never done before, but what confidence is so full of ... Achu and Six Senses ... Rather, they're similar to theirs, but they can show different charms while maximizing their merits with other index My Girl songs. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ That girl's crush looks cool It's a new look like this It's just ruined It's not like I'm not able to digest anything like a hidden card.
The problem with this group is that no one can say good things ;;;; I don't know what the merits of their group are .... I think it's just a problem and I think it will succeed if I change it. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Really laughing at V app and blame the whole life ... !! I don't know who's next to me, but I'm laughing while I'm laughing. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ It's an excuse. It was obvious to the public that there was no respect for the original song ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ It's so ridiculous Yes, it seems that things I wanted to do is getting worse. Only steamed fans wanted to see the V app ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋ will not be very entertaining.
=
What does this steaming cola feel like
=
I saw hell's boombar, but the algorithm recommends this .......
=
If there's one day of rain, then I'll pop one day 욭 ㅌㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Papa
=
It's like a baby, because the original song is so strong
=
No, but I don't know how many times I see it, but every time I come in, I think of a new idea. Other groups confronted me by changing the lyrics to rap, performance, and arrangement that weren't in the original song. But if Six Sense really wanted to do it, it would not have been bad to change it a little bit to suit their color.
=
This is Death Wink restaurant
=
???: Kids, do you want to be a singer?
=
At the end of the Park Bom reaction, I saw the dance on the children's fire.
=
No, it's so funny 겤 ㅋㅎ ㅎㅋㅎㅋ In the comments, 'K-pop' has two meanings, and after reading that comment, the 'K-pop' that comes out at the end of the Queendom video
=
It's not as smooth as this stage.
=
4:01 Gracia ~
=
Thanks to the Queendam movie, I'm tired of traveling until the 1990s ^^
=
Ah ~~~~ I think
=
I'm going to look higher than V-girl six sense video to see how bad this performance is.
=
I think I'm coming all day to see the comments
=
I watch this video.
=
I wash off dishonor with today's goldensmith
=
Why did you hit Kay Paap and this is the first video
=
I'm finally crazy .. I have to come in once a day.
=
Today K. Yea was sick.
=
Paap ~
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This is a drug video Come to see me whenever I think
=
Lovelyz will remain the eternal history of black history.
=
합 ❤

♡
=
No, I searched Shiva Abracadabra. Why is this?
=
Kay, let's eat magnesium
=
Other than this, there's no ulzzang out there.
=
Paap ~ ♡
=
But I don't know why I insist on girl crush ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Baby Soul and Crystal are pretty good at voices.
Lovelyz Originally dreamy, pretty, cute and innocent well ,,,,
=
I still didn't know how bad it was until I saw the intro.
=
Compared with the video
Beer Girl: I'm Zlatan !! Eoheung !!
Lovelyz: Meowtan pretending to be Zlatan ...
=
3:46 Bibliography right back dancer Park Sung Kwang
=
But after watching 7 times, Lovelyz doesn't seem to be very talented and just didn't pay much attention to the song itself ... In 7th, Yein and Kay were so good ... and Kay could make a voice like this Why the stage is ...
=
I don't know how many times I've seen each member's winks while watching these videos ... I keep winking ... I'm seeing eyes ... This isn't a song ...
=
Eng ... Was this the song that was so prestigious?
=
I really don't want to compare it, so I made a comparison, and it covers how much elaborated song B'A Girl sang ...
=
What's the real thing?
=
K lacks a lot of magnesium.
=
I want lovelyz change to new song i want him to be sexy.
=
Hmm ... the original song is better ...
=
Everyone is so thin ...
=
Small ball shot by K-pop

I'm here than you can

Hello, Lovelyz Elite, Kindly please take a look at the direct cam.

Hit that high is the best part of the whole
=
Crystal America is doing well ...
=
The index feels like six senses, but the rest is just Lovelyz.
=
What do people go to see this in person?
=
Didn't Ryu Soo-jeong laugh at the stage like this and turn on the broadcast and pretend not to be organized?
If you're a public figure, if you know that the stage is wrong, you can't apologize.
=
It's Vienna, but what's going on?
=
I guess I should have gone to the trap bit before stealing 1st from the ste ... I feel a little dull ... The 808 bass is just a rap part.
=
Ryu Soo-jung Seo Su-gi already dont ,,
=
Don't forget that the gel is better
=
I'm eating it all
Towing is recovering little by little in the third contest ~ ing
=
It's more like winking time than calling one part
=
It's a lovely fan, but it's a little bad
I'm not totally aware of the concept except for Missouri and Jisoo. Kay's just cute.
=
If you want to cover a huh, understand the lyrics and sing along.
And the lyrics themselves aren't something that can be covered by a bunch of sweets like Lovelyz.
What is the current girl group that can sing this song?
=
This song is so scary, why are you so upset?
=
At the same time, Su Ji Su and Yeo Mi seem to understand the concept properly. Crystal tried hard but failed because she was cute.
=
I'd rather have fun with Mamamu
=
To break away from the existing image
You can challenge with new concepts.
To challenge, you first have to understand
Isn't it first? If you don't understand, I'd ask for advice from V-A-Gull who sang the original song.
I think.
How many years have you made your debut and aren't rookies?
If you want to escape the existing image, find a way to escape properly and make an effort.
In the end, that effort didn't melt at all, leading to catastrophic failure.
If your group doesn't show different colors,
It will stay at that level, and it will lead to obvious results.
You can challenge.
But the program called Queendom is not a challenging program
I'm literally competing, but I wonder if I even understood the purpose of the program.
I don't know how many places I'll be next week, but I hope you think you're sixth.
=
I couldn't see it all the time, so I saw Jiho's meow now. Baby Soul popped up. No, not Kay.
=
There are 8 members, but I don't think there are any members who turn their heads like Jeon So-yeon or Jimin Hwasa
=
I'm just worried about Papa ~ ♥ squeezing the squeezed food .... I wondered if I'm going to turn the channel ..... I believe you've figured out why the concept was created by your company. ㅠㅠ
=
Oh my girl is a bodhisattva as a group .. I haven't heard anything in advance, and even though I've gotten ridiculous things that don't cover their songs, I'm responding by changing my soul on such a copper stage.
=
Bae Yoon Jung: Do you want to be a singer?
=
B-girl Six Sense feels that the pop part is really strong and full, but this voice is too thin and powerless. The voice and the voice don't match well Even though my girl is similar to Lovelyz's atmosphere, she somehow re-interpreted the song. Is there a ticket? I came out and chose this
=
# 6 Not sure ...
=
If you do this, you can call the pop part as a group or let the 걍 sol call it all.
To be honest, K Pahab ~ is too big.
=
Papa ~ Why did you give the Ca .. I need to expand, but there is no power. At least the Americas fits best with the concept
=
There's no flesh on your fingertips
I think it's going to hurt if I miss my nails ...
=
Don't pop subtitles like that. Hahahaha
=
For Lovelyz, it's real .. I've been poisoned to participate in this pro ... The first one is a concept miss. The second one is the most difficult song among the great talents of the B-girl.
=
There's still someone who swear at me lol
=
3:46 In fact, this video was made to see Jiho's meow. You know Lovelyz Song Features It's not an exciting lyrics, but it's a bit of a joy to sing happily ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅠㅠ Very good ............. .....
=
The stage is all good, but I didn't know the original Lovelyz, but it's very interesting. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ In the Queen's Six Sense, I received the concept especially well. I wanted to do this but it's refreshing on the stage again lol
=
I want to be good, but I want to be good at ng. I'm accumulating ng. What is this lyrics?
=
This makes me feel good. I just feel good. I've seen so many things and I'm not tired and feel good every time I see them. Interesting
=
If you think about it, it's a concept that every girl group should try once, and when many girl groups have pretty and cute looks, Pyeongta is a hitting concept. . Maybe the hardest thing. Anyone who's especially good at flattering.
=
Lovelyz and Oh My Girl said they were similar, but as soon as I saw these two groups, they felt completely different ... ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Lovelyz's charm. Mothers will like it very much.
=
When I look at K-parts, I look at them happily.
=
What did you find your own color now? LOLZZLIES Do you think they're good at this? You know, you've done something else.
=
Jeong Ye-in's eyes on the stage, and her eyes are already vocal, so the real cameo was so good .. You can do well, but Jin is so good to call ㅠㅠ
=
As the Americas scream and walk out of elite pollen
I keep thinking about it
=
If you did this, you didn't swear?
No, I'm taking it for granted. No, I'm guilty. What do you think?
=
Suh Ji Soo's face is crazy How do you feel like you're so pretty?
=
Looking closely, I've stood a lot in the center on this stage. The younger sister was injured when she did the original song.
=
From the point of view of a third party who is neither a lovely fan nor an anti, these friends are not able to do it. It's not like you're going to have a double bath like that.
And there are people who say that it's good to keep doing things, but Lovelyz's not just doing it, but it's developing more and more. Shouldn't you please .. Siksen's comments are over 30,000, so good at only 6,000? .. Really too much these people
=
It's so lovely, I'm so lovely I know what to look for when and how to make it Miju ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I just don't need to say it's perfect
=
Koreans are missing in comments ...? It's Miracle, but this time, Lovelyz's stage was so good.
=
When you listen to the song Lovelys, it seems to be manipulated. Triangle, hi, cameo. It reminds me of a memory that I never loved so much when I was young and young.
=
Actually, Lovelyz is a very subtle group rather than a gorgeous feeling .. The longer you know it, the better your strengths are. It's a group .. It's really clear but the sound is so sad that only Lovelyz can make it .. It feels like the chimes are ringing. I want to team ㅠㅠ
=
This stage is the best and the third in Queendom, but I've been studying and staying back and coming back ㅠㅠㅠ Just like other stages.
=
Right now it's good. Kingdom. Don't think about this.
=
I'm not a fan because I don't like it so much. I've sweared a lot, but when I see this stage, I feel rewarded.
=
There are many cases where most girl groups go out innocent at first and then go to sexy concept.
=
Obviously they feel good when they look like this
=
No one has ever seen it.
=
Real Lovelyz is a group with flowers and gentle rain with a soothing scent.
I don't have many idols who sing beautifully and sadly .. I'm doing so well, but as time goes on, more people will appreciate it.
=
If you sing a ballad with cameo lyrics
At last, the man is giving flowers to another woman other than Lovelyz.
No, no, no, no, no!
=
ㅠㅠ Musical Concept It's a real one, and each one's role is really good, I'm really good at the interpretation of the costume. ㅠㅠ
=
Seo Ji Soo, I'm a pretty actor
=
Stop the bad guys. Uhh ... Do this. If you stop doing that. Or try something else. Why are there so many people talking like a braid?
I'm so pretty again Lovelyz
=
I really want to hit the kids who have ridiculed all kinds of excuses for the stage; You're not interested in the group called Lovelyz, but you recognize that you can't see one or two stages. Lovelyz was just trying to take on a new challenge every moment.
Please see
=
Lovelyz song must have something to stimulate people's mind
=
I've never seen anyone wear those thick glasses better than the brush.
=
The voice of the elite and the oxsol are so good ... and Jin looks like a teen girl.
=
Of course, it was the best of all Lovelyz stages. Of course, there may be more stages that Lovelyz can do, but there is only one stage that Lovelyz can do. I wish it was the best
=
I keep thinking about this song and humming ㅠㅠ Really this song is what it is ㅠㅠ It's okay to be a day.
=
Even though it wasn't until the official fans of Lovelyz, I've been listening to the stage video since the debut and I loved the song so much that I've been constantly listening to this stage. I was so sick that I had so much swearing at Six Senses.
In the past, the Americas had a lot of bad guys in the article. The criticisms and ridicules pretending to be criticized were concerned about how painful the Americans and other members and their families would be. If you see this comment, please know that you are really cheering on the internet and that you like it a lot. Don't get hurt, remember the people who love and support Lovelyz and come out with great songs and great music.
=
It's really pretty. On the stage, the Americas and Crystal look so pretty and so attractive. They push other kids like K. They're too attractive to be buried and buried in groups. I'm looking at the Cameo because of the Lovelyz Americas.
ring!!! Push Americas Crystal !!!!
=
I always thought it would be a really lovely musical concept, so I thought it would be good to cover Socie Aga Boy. But this time, it's refreshing and it's the best.
=
Understand other teams' reactions Keep the color of Lovelyz but feel like it has a broader spectrum. Lovelyz's color isn't as bright as it sounds. There are things that I can't explain
=
The group always really cheered. Of course, you can't lay down with Lovelyz skills and the visuals are crazy.
=
It's like a stage that proved that the group's name could be Lovelyz Sad lyrics Fresh melody Cute stage A big and brilliant choreographed movement The result of the members' digestion is the love itself ... It's not too much.
=
This week's video was so famous that I talked with my friends today
=
And Immersive Simmons Bed Grade Ryu Crystal Bangs
=
I don't want to take care of the artist and the fans.
You have to have some writing for the development of the artist, but it's just bad. Feedback is not that way.
Please leave a little more thought :)
Artists and their fans are hurt
Please watch the video with a little better eyes and a warm heart!
So have a nice day!!!!
=
The group that knows the most in Queendom is Lovelyz. Thank you for being so proud and bright in spite of criticism. I seemed to find the right one through various atmosphere challenges
=
I've seen and felt at the Queen's Six Senses stage for the first time. Lovelyz I really wanted to do a lot of things for 6 years. Is it too much to be mocked and ridiculed because I didn't understand the original concept? Is there anybody who didn't know that they were attracted to Lovelyz's ability at the beginning of their debut? It's a pain, but this time I came up with a cameo, but the stage was so good and it was so good. But these damn Mnet guys are back. Lovelyz I've got a subtitle. Where do you wanna go nimyeon the LOVELYZ and in broadcast ... I'm doing'll want to remove the recipe and want to needles
Everyone, this moonlight Lovelys wanted to play the deceptive concept properly.
Don't know, it's because you're in pain after seeing Lovelyz.
=
The lyrics are like Lovelyz, so I'm cheering more on Lovelyz ...
I can do well
In front of the heart I want to be good at
NG only
=
'I can do well, but I want to do well, I only accumulate ng'. I was upset because I remembered the last contests.
=
My Standard Queendom Legend
Mamamu-I miss U
Kids- These are the stages Legend ..
Lion
Lovelyz-Camel
Park Bom-Eye Nose
Oh My Girl-Destiny
AoA- I'm you
=
5 times a day
=
Wow, I'm not a lovely fan but I'm so lovely and I'm not sure
=
The Americas have exploded, too.
=
Lovelyz's unbroken love is so good
=
Even if you look at it again, this stage is a stage where every single Lovelyz can be seen
=
Ryu Soojung is a treasure
=
These guys are so big that they're so colorful that they're so desperate that they debuted yesterday
=
I understand why the group name is Lovelyz.
=
Lovelyz's choice is respecting both sides.
Hey, I'm going to do what kids want to do ~~~ What would you do if you used subtitles that could move public opinion?
=
I think I know why this song is Pandora's box. It was Miracle, so I searched for and listened to some lovely Lovely songs with Om Girl ... This song was good but it was shocking that I had never heard it. I wanted to play this song. Lovelyz's group name I don't know who created it but I did it well
=
I'm so thankful and grateful for this stage
This stage was really good
=
This is the first video I've watched every day.
=
The name Lovelyz fits so well .. The group with the power to make the listener feel so good
=
I feel like a fan who knows the value or potential of the group while being a real Pandora box.
=
The lyrics are so sad ... The melody is bright.
=
Obviously this concept is so pretty for Rubbly.
=
I'm really sure why Lovelyz is Lovelyz.
=
It's not the title of this song, but the Pandora's Box is amazing. I also have eyes for Lovelyz fans.
=
It's like a school musical opening scene where you always treat yourself as a cameo who can't connect with someone you like but end up with someone else.
=
It wasn't the stage where I saw it at first, but the one-to-three poppet type Seven 8 stays in my ears.
=
It was a pity that Lovelyz was spilled during the second cover song, but now the stage is dressed with the right color and shines more. I laughed and watched, but suddenly crying when I was in refrain .. I'm not a fan.
=
This is just like seeing a day after a day's memory loss ... I'm seeing a day with no memory, and now I don't know my name and the ending in this comic is fixed and I lose my memory. In the past, there were many scenes that passed by in the day and manga, but now, cameo, a cameo, who sees a day, a character with a weight that is not a cameo ..
=
I feel like I'm working hard on the Americas so I hope it won't change in the future
=
I listened to the tears ... ㅠㅠ .... 1, 2 times in the contest was badly bad, but the 3rd contest was such a good stage, tears in a row to the right TT I wasn't attracted by the charm of Lovelyz. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I want to go back to the original song. The song is so good and the music is so pretty. I listened until spring. I want you to sing a more popular song, but I understand as a level fan (rbb, Jimsala beam ;;) Anyway, fans listen to the songs, so the masterpieces are known. Lovelyz is all cheering, but especially K-Cho is so cheering!
=
Lovely songs that are unique to Lovelyz Every time I listen to them, my voice is so pretty, especially when the eight of them sing together. I think that Lovelyz has grown a lot through Queendom.
=
Wow
=
This is the best stage I've ever done.
Even if you look at it, the members are comfortable and enjoyable,
=
America really ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Why are you doing that? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
There are some people who say Lovelyz songs or singers are flat and individual. Lovelyz songs don't have to bounce from each other, they blend together to create an atmosphere. It's a characteristic of Lovelyz, which is a personality. It was known as a group that is good at a cappella. Each sings a different voice. So the Lovelyz songs are all at once! There are many more songs that you can listen to calmly and comfortably than bouncing songs. It is better to listen to other songs, understand what group Lovelyz is and judge it. My tastes and thoughts are different, but I think I have to know criticism. I hope you see it too fragmented and not judge.
I add it in case. The songs are in harmony, not in the same voice. Each one is unique and distinct. When we sing together, each other's voices harmonize with each other. When we sing alone, we must say that our personality is more revealed. There is a lack of explanation, but if you listen to it, you will feel it.
=
When we play Lovelyz
I want you to sing one song
ㄹㅇ Songs included
=
The kids themselves seem to be relaxing and having a good time. The reactions of other groups are also black-and-white and sixteen, but it's not a squeezing reaction, but a really good feeling.
=
I think it's like this
=
Lovelyz I didn't like it very much, but somehow I keep coming to watch this video.
=
I'm not sure how many times I'm going to see this in my heart during the Queendom stage.
=
If you look at it already, it's already cold-looking, but it's like Busan's native soup.
=
If someone makes mv with this song every day
=
I didn't know, but in fact, we have a lot of scenes passed by. Short greetings ~ Short dialogues ~ Can't be your opponent ~
=
It's like a US teen musical movie.
=
If you look at the tension and fashion in America, you are not a cameo.
How do you support that tension?
=
The Americas are really funny ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I was surprised at the end
=
I was so happy that it was a stage where I could show that I was a team that can do so well.
=
Are they crazy?
=
I keep thinking while watching this stage, why can't I be number one? # 1 in my heart
=
Lovelyz seems to know how to make people happy .. I feel sorry for me because I sing brightly. But I want to keep singing. I really like it
=
"You can do well, but you want to do well, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 NG will accumulate"
I think the lyrics are a Queendom Lovelyz situation.
=
Wow
=
Ryu Sujeong is so pretty.
=
It's so crazy that I can't say it. TT quality and arrangement skills at concerts.
=
Really Lovelyz reminds me of pink and Oh My Girl thinks of Yeondu, green .. I think it's different.
=
It's hard to have a concept that's overwhelming when you debut, but it's great to be able to do this
=
This is Dano, Baekkyung, I want you to play when you come out one day.
=
Even if you didn't care, you would have suffered from aggravation for a while, but I hope you will be a musician who listens to compliments and plays music for a long time! I feel like flying the stress that I've received from bad guys! Thank you very much. Lovelyz ㅎㅎ
=
Videos you should watch periodically
=
I did a good job. The tones are good. Gianna is trying to make her voice less so much better.
=
Just like a Lovelys' legend stage
=
Soyeon's insight, and she's pretty. "I think it's possible because it's Lovelyz seniors."
=
The lovely point of Lovelyz's songs is not just popular songs, but many songs you can listen to for a long time.
This Cameo stage is also back-convinced that it will not remain a moment now but will remain a legend stage that will continue to be loved.
Lovelyz was so good
=
The scream skills of America were said to have worked ...
=
00:25 So it's cute that you missed the beat here, ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Mother of America also commented last time ㅠ Mother of America has a bad comment 'America is pretty' Article Comments that America sees no matter how much I look like a mother ID shed tears at the hostel TT Idol is a person It's the same person who can change college majors, challenge and fail.
It's the same person who works hard until he becomes a protagonist.
=
I thought you were good at dubbed men when you first intro
I didn't know it was Jang Jun
I can't beat Lee Jang-joon
Golden child!
=
I'm wearing Soul's glasses on the intro part, but the camera is holding it in the corner because I can't catch it.
That's cute
=
It's the most fan seeing stage I've seen and heard the most.
=
I thought this concept was the best girl group, but it was amazing that I showed it to the maximum.
This stage was really good because I washed my critics and showed them their best.
Real teen feeling so fresh and nice
=
I've been thinking about it before, but I felt it better when I saw this stage, but Oh My Girl and Lovelyz are different colors
When I think of my unrequited love in school
If my feelings of unrequited love still come to mind even if I forget but my heart still gets scared
Lovelyz loved it with all his heart, without having to reconsider it. At that time, it was a feeling of unrequited love.
Personally, I like both feelings. I feel like everyone else is attracted to the two groups through this Queendom.
=
When I look at Queen's Queen, what's next to her? She's black in my head. I keep playing and stopped by today.
=
The only thing that makes this concept so good is Lovelyz ...

The song has a unique sensibility that is highly recommended for those who want to feel it! b
I am deeply grateful to Queendom for reminding me of the memories I had forgotten for a long time.
=
Yoo Ji-ae's voice is like the voice of a singer who sings in one class.
=
I don't want Lovelyz to be a refreshing or unconditional stage, but the unique charm and atmosphere that only Lovelyz can digest is so good for these stages. I don't hate other stages. I love you ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ♡♡ ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Personally, I would have been able to win the first place without sunglasses due to early criticism.
=
I'd like to use a cappella once in the final. Lovelyz is a cappellaron first place.
=
What is that woman so elite? Even from a distance, that woman's face is clearer than my future. Maybe such a person is caught only in Korea, I do not understand. Lovelyz to Billboard.
=
It's so cute that the crystal missed the timing when you were caught one by one.
=
Watching the Sixth Sense Stage These guys should be innocent. I'm a mass-produced idol, and came back to the cameo stage. They don't know their color. I think it's better to have a different charm than usual, and I think it's a chance for Queendom to do that. Then I know their strengths so why would they wink and sneak in Six Senses? Is a group that has always been a fan service for Son Kiss and Wink, and even during Destiny's activities, K showed a camera and threw a heart, that is, it was wrong to do fan service on the grand song rather than interpreting it. To be an element, and Liz did the musical concept with the Cameo Broadway version at the concert and never did it during her usual activities, and she brought one musical and another arrangement at the concert. I think it's a program that could broaden the spectrum of Love and Lovez is a mass production idol. I wrote the hide-and-seek song that was included at the time, and the cameo meeting process and the moonlight meeting process, and if you reflect your opinion, I can show you what you want to do properly. Please don't
=
But this song is sad, bright, sad. Good song. Thanks to Queendom.
=
The lyrics are so lovely, I think it would be hard
=
Lovelyz unrequited sensibility is so good ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ Cute is not a protagonist in the end is a sad story that only remains as a cameo, I like to wrap it in a bright melody
=
I want to see a lot of people dancing in the center since Mr. Kinja
=
This concept
Lovelyz seems to be a big mood, but the atmosphere was bright but it was a little bit crying because of the lyrics. I personally liked the cameo song so I think this stage is the best among the lovely stages. I wonder how it was
=
Yoo Ji-ae's dog sounds good ,,,?
=
Like a musical
=
It's a real kilppo screaming in the middle and the end.
=
I'm Alfred, I love you so much. I can't do it last time. This is too good for you! I feel like I'm just excited because I felt so happy and filled the stage a bit more ☺️ I'm standing in the middle of the dance. ❤❤❤❤
=
I feel like my voice is clean.
=
Something cool looks cool, but it sounds like a silvery baby.
=
The drama reminds me of the day I discovered
=
Lovelyz is so beautiful ㅠㅠㅠ 1st place in my heart Queendom stage ㅠㅠ
=
Personally, he was wearing glasses, so I thought he would throw it off and have a break. It was a faithful cameo to the end.
=
I'm really good at this
Jisoo is like a club senior,
Crystal is like a young girl who wants to go to academy.
America is just like a hero
Jin is like a cheerleader pretty leader,
Baby Soul was originally cute, but she became more cute by wearing glasses,
Ji-ae is like a school
Kay is like a fairy tale princess,
You are like a schoolboy with glasses.
Just so pretty simply!
Who knew how to make a real perforated desk? It's so pretty.
You're not a cameo, but a hero!
Real Lovelyz is so good.
I love you❤
=
4:07 The moment I fell in love with an elite
=
It was a stage like watching a musical movie like La La Land.
=
4:01 Oh, I was so happy, so musical and so lively that I was so happy during the stage. It's hard to explain why I like it so much that I've seen it on the top ten fingers
=
Jisu (Nim)-It's a matchless, but the eyes are really big
Ji ae-baby comes up !! This face is second in the team .. ㅠㅠㅠ Too cute but there is a joy behind it!
Ye In-First face look .. !! But you should say it's very pretty ..? The youngest but not the youngest (meaning mature! I'm not saying that he looks old !!!!)
Crystal (Nim)-cheek meat is attractive !! Cute and attractive thanks to her cheeks
Kei-Kei also attractive! But the feeling is different from the other feelings .. But the conclusion is also good
Miju (Nim)-cold beauty looks like / even Miju (nim) .. just look at the appearance of the thought that should not be judged! ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ((sound screaming ~~~))
Jin-Looks like something nice (??) But sadness is less attention than other members ㅠㅠ
Baby Soul (daughter)-Dimples are very attractive Most people do not think you are a beauty, but look pretty and cute face looks !!
Bottom Line: Lovelyz is pretty, cute and charming !!
I think some personalities are good !!
I'm a good friend. I hope you all become lovers soon.
=
If you have a genre called Lovelyz, it's Lovelyz. I love you a lot
=
Kay is so cute waving on the desk in ref. 1
=
I think it's a stage that shows why it's Lovelyz I'm so lovely all the time that you look so lovely
=
The hidden winner of Queendom is like Lovelyz. Actually, I did everything well, but the magnificent and magnificent stage keeps me feeling a little tired and quick. In fact, it's like a stage style that makes the audience feel good in a solo concert.
=
I already have a real ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'm so fond of it ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Seo Ji Soo is so pretty ...
=
How many times do you really look for ... If you tell me to forget the video that makes me look again ㅠㅠ
=
My favorite Lovelyz is back. This stage can only be a real lovely. And the Americas is so funny lol
=
Oh, I'm listening to it all the time because it's so good.
=
Jin is so pretty
=
Wow, it's nice to have a gap between you and Jinja before.
=
What's really good about this stage is that I can't distinguish between the back dancers and the members from far away in the late stage.
Really ... Cameo's facial expressions and gestures don't know if you don't look close, but Cameo seems to say that you love and express it.
=
Lee Soo-jung Yoo Ji-seo Lee Mi-joo Kim Ji-yeon Kim Myung-eun Ryu Soo-jeong
=
2:44 Already, how many times does this turn around?
=
I watched the stages before so hard, but this was the stage I watched because it was the first time I knew the good song of Lovelyz. Lol I always saw Cameo for the first time knowing Achu and Destiny.
=
I was swearing and criticized a lot in Queendom but I think it was the process of finding out what suits you best and what you are doing well. And it grew more. In fact, even in the stages, even though they wore the same concept clothes, they were not harmonious and awkward. On this stage, even though they wore different clothes such as school uniform cheerleading clothes, they looked good together and melted into the song. ♡♡♡
=
3:21 Park Jin-young ...?
=
Something's going to change, they're going to try to do the same thing, they're going to get sick, but of course they've never done it, they've tried and tried to show them good looks, and there's a lot of praise and regret, but it's not unfair to turn around and show them what they do best. It's like the stage you showed ...
=
Who put a red ribbon on Kay's head? Blessed
=
It's Lovelyz that's cute and dreamy.
=
Lovelyz I liked this but I honestly liked Six Sense
=
Imju Seo Ji-su Visual match is coming ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The song is really lively .... the lyrics are so sad.
=
The more I hear, the better it goes with me
=
Now I'm seeing the light on the stage as a group in Queendom. It's not a joke of your existence. I'm making a stage to shine on you.
=
Whenever I see this, tears are filled up ... If you want to shine like a fairy, you're going to have to worry about it. I think there's more to it
=
At this time, I did really well ㅠㅠㅠ Lovelyz This concept is so good ... And Lovelyz songs have a lot of lyrics that are sympathized far. I think it's a lovely song
=
No, it's America. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ What's innocent and pretty? The voice is clear and fresh, but I can't bet with that pretty voice !!!! Come back !!!!! What is it? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The song I really liked was born again like this, but it's so good.
=
I'm so funny and cute.
=
It's cute in the middle.
=
Ending Ending ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
"Do this is acting"
=
The mood of the song is bright but the lyrics are sad
=
But the stage is really exciting.
=
Why is it good for the speaker to stare at me? ㅠㅠ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
+ I felt a little burdened at the beginning, but K is doing well and I open my mind because I laugh hard at anything ... 땃싀
=
No, it was true that Black Achu and Six Sense were serious, but when I was criticized, I wanted to change the concept a little bit better.
=
1:16 You'll die cute with all your hair.
=
This time, I was really surprised that she sang with a voice that goes well with her.
=
It's crazy, I think I'm going to die Cuteness Let's do it well If you're good at this stage, you're not going to get this feeling.
=
If you look at the perfection of the stage, Lovelyz and the children are doing well this time.
The stage should be full
=
It's so cute sitting at her desk and waving her hair.
=
The Americas are so pretty ... It looks so pretty No, but ㅋㅋㅋ ㅌㅌㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ What are the endings? ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Scary voices that look like princesses ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Everyone! ♡
=
What the hell is this? LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL
=
When you look at K-Vulse, the tone is so pretty
=
I love you
=
4:11 This is a little bit like the kid in the K Teen movie.
=
1:49 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This expression my expression ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋ
=
The lyrics say something about Lovelyz
There are many things to show well, but only NG piles up ㅠ I can do this well, but I want you to show me what you can do better
=
Now it's Lovelyz!
=
I was really good at this stage
=
This was so good
=
This stage reaction Everyone smiles dad and dad ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
The lyrics seem to fit the lovely situation
This stage is really right ~ This is the stage of Lovelyz that only Lovelyz can do! I think it was a stage that looked so good
First of all, my taste was snipered ... Everybody's so pretty and the musical feels so good
TT TT T T T T T T T T T
=
Lyrics good, no, look happy.
=
The last cry of the Americas came back because I was not forgotten ..
=
3:22 0.5 second Kidmill
=
It's so good that it's creepy ㅠ This stage is really the best I've been repeating infinitely ㅠ As you said, Lovelyz was so beautiful when sang together
=
It is much better to see them enjoying the stage they are doing well.
=
America ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I wasn't really excited about it. Hey in the middle of the song.
=
Kay smiles so pretty
=
Ryu Soo Jung ㄹㅇ I felt like I had a crush once in school.
=
I think Lovelyz did best this time
=
Sincerely, Lovelyz songs are all good. One third of my playlist is like a Lovelyz song.
=
Wow .... so far I haven't missed a day so pretty.
=
1:56 Oh yeah, am I funny ... Seriously oh yeah ~
↑ If you keep pressing it, the rhythm is ...

Samsol's first sister, right? I'm so cute ..

=
1:26 Ryu Su-jeong

I'm going crazy already ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
So cute and fun at the stage Lovelyz ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
No, it's like Queen Queen's gag, followed by General Hyejeong. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It seems to come to see once a day .. Every time I feel good.
=
K is so cute
=
Lovelyz always loves a spoonful of songs
=
1:14 ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ TT ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Dear sister TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT ㅠ ㅠ
=
When you see Kim Yong-sun's Lovelyz, it's so funny to go up your mouth.
=
Every time I see why I'm happy
=
General Hyejeong 02:58 Reaction cute 닼 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Only me come to see this every day ...? Everybody looks so good and happy to see you,
=
I'm so adorable ㅠ ㅠㅋㅋㅋ Lovelyz ♥♥♥
=
Yeah, this is Lovelyz ... I feel like I've seen Queendom to see this
=
America is so cute lol
=
Lovelyz ㅠㅠ Group Name Really Tteok ㅠㅠ Everyone is so lovely ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ♥
=
Lovelyz It looks good because it seems to have grown up ㅠㅠ ❤️❤️
=
America is coming back
=
3:07 Bibliography, are you crazy? So pretty
=
Hahahaha
=
Sincerely cameo ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
No, but what's the tension of the week already? ㅋㅋ ㄱㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Hey! Don't go !! You look chic when you look at your real face. It's kind of like that ㅋ ㅋㅌㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ I already like this
=
Oh, the writers .. There was a perfect song here .. ㅠㅠㅜㅠ OST I wanted ㅠㅜㅠ
=
No immigrants
=
1:16 Oh cute TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT
=
A little personally, I think AOA is lovely at Lovelyz.
=
When I saw the stage setting, I thought I was thinking about the stage group that the girl group would do
Rubbly definitely looks good with this concept ... I loved it
=
Really Lovelyz So good ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Too hard to keep up my hard life of the entrance exam was so precious. Lovelyz I'm really good at this and I want to know that there are a lot of famous songs. I see a lot in the comments.
=
0:56 Cute little bitch
=
0:26 Selling nose (?)
=
Mom smiles all the time
So Yeon is right This stage can only be Lovelyz
=
2:33 That finger really drives me crazy
=
Citation Count? So pretty
=
America ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Forced live certification ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Cute and real
=
0:25 One beat late revision ㅠㅠ Cute ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The smile doesn't fade from my face all the time I look at it. Happiness spreads.
=
I like it so much
=
0:26 수 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Ryu Sujeong is so cute ...
=
4:59 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㄲㄲ ㄱㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㄲㄲ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Cameo ㅠㅠ Really favorite song ㅠㅠ Hing ...
=
The other team's stage may have been more amazing, but I think this stage is the best way to convey emotions. Lol It's so cute and lovely, I can hear the lyrics well and the stage composition and acting is so lovely. Laughing and waking
=
It's so pretty.
=
The elite is so pretty
=
At the end of the bibliographic number of killing weeks ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
Americas: No .... Come back!
=
Miju's sister too honey jam
I'm sorry. I can speak a little Korean. TT
=
Lovelyz It was really good this time Song was good and TT TT TT Top Contest I had a lot of troubles but still it was good to see a variety of lovely things. Im lol
=
3:47 Why are you so surprised twice?
=
It's like a teen movie.
=
I can't help it
=
3:07 4:15 Bibliography is so pretty
=
It's so cute and lovely ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Cameo's sincere title
=
America is so pretty ..
=
Please give me a lot of spare parts ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
This time, I've made good use of my real strength.
=
This stage is so pretty
=
The voice is so pretty.
=
I did so well ㅠㅠ I will see 5 times a day ㅠㅠ
=
Previous stages were unfortunate, but comments were overwhelming. Other videos are Lovelyz ..
=
The whole idea of ​​seeing Queendom is pretty.
=
This song is really good
=
I like the song, but why are you sympathizing with the lyrics?
=
I don't know how lovely this is ... I like musicals, but I just tear this song, when I look at this stage .. It's really sweet and bitter.
=
2:25 Left, cute look.
=
I think it's a good surprise. I'm surprised to see that the audience score is the last time.
=
I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
The stage like this musical is so good ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
3:22 I'm smiling even after seeing it many times.
=
I think it's better to hold the concept and stage like the heroines in a teen movie like this ...
=
And my standard Lovelyz is good at gel ..
=
Ah the last stage ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ It's so inverted and so cute lol
=
Ah, I'm so cute Ryu Sujeong is really cute ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
2:26 Does it feel like Lala Land?
=
I've been missing since the first measure, I like your voice
=
Wow, it's the top song among the songs that I didn't really want to title.
=
Replying to @David_Wolf
=
3:07 Suh Ji Soo, I'm crazy.
=
This stage is really good
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I watched so many of you so I love that dancer
=
It's so natural as if you're wearing the perfect outfit for Lovelys.
=
It's just amazing
=
It's like a musical.
=
The Americas ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
K-Johnny is pretty
=
It's like an atmosphere that only Lovelyz can digest. The melody is so cheerful but the lyrics are sad
=
5:01 The Americas are so cute ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Gin's mouth is a treasure trove ㅠㅠㅠ Lovelyz's unique song is bright, but the lyrics are sad, it's a lip song itself.
=
I feel lovely like a real group name.❤
=
Ah, America is funny.
That charm is rare
=
Oh I keep thinking about it
=
Everyone cameo getting the really good TT TT TT I'm tired of the crystal tone ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Ryu Soojeong just feels good because it's so good.
=
No, I'm just over the end of America. I'm really smiling at America.
=
Oh, I'm so crying ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's so nice that Lovelyz is supported by many people.
I've been mocked and ridiculed for a few weeks.
=
4:59 Killing part ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
There's too much thought that this song wasn't wow since it came out, but it would have been amazing if it was the title
I heard this, but I'm so glad you did it in Queendom. I think it was a more touching stage because every one of the members understood the lyrics and showed them with expressions. Wouldn't it have been if there were enlightenment in the criticism of the viewers in the 1.2 contest?
=
It's funny and fluffy.
=
Honestly, I think it would be nice to see the matured songs in REWIND .. Cameo feels that I did 1000 times better on stage.
=
0:49 Wow, it's so pretty ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
1:30 It's just amazing ...
=
Really amazing ...
=
I'm crazy for a day, but I'm sad because it overlaps with this song.
=
1:57 jyp? Ha ha ha
=
I feel like watching a musical. The clown didn't go down for five minutes.
=
It's so pretty ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ 4:00 Here's the best .. The choreographies are also pretty and lovely.
=
Lyrics so cute ㅠㅠ stage cute!
=
I feel like I'm too tight because of the imitation tension and the costume and the steaming. I think each character has a different one, but the Americas are having a unrequited love but don't give up even if they fail ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm paying for such a name ㅎㅎ Lovelyz ㅠㅠ Lovely
=
Not to mention K's honorary recovery all the way through the broadcast, and that the Americas are all in Menbung nowadays. I was so tired of seeing the contest and I was hurt so much. I did so much work to show this stage perfectly and I love the conclusion! ❣️
=
I really liked this stage so much
=
2:57 No, this sister, every time I watch this video
Phrase lovelys best
Just the queen group is the best
=
2:43 I thought this part was really pretty .....
=
4:33 I'm so happy to see you at this moment
=
All of Lovelyz's concept is good, but the songs have been so bad because they have missed the song so far.
=
Ah lol lol
=
It's so cute
=
Ah, lol. Why are you so funny ??? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's so cute
=
There are so many good things in Lovelyz! Personally, I really recommend triangles !!! Lovely lyrics are unique to the sad song goes well with the lyrics ㅠㅠ
And winter is coming, so be sure to listen to the bells in December.
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ and I can't see why I can give you tears.
=
Hey ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
That pink-haired dancer is the heroine, and the other dancers and Lovelyz are the cameo.
=
It's so cute like apples
=
No, I'm so crazy ... I'm so pretty I wear crazy glasses ... I'm so crazy ... Really ... Who's the styling man I'll really do that one time ... I hit two index fingers while cameo It's so cute to hit and talk.
=
Ah, the Americas are really pretty
=
2:44 Jisoo is so pretty.
=
I'm so excited ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Cute ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Ryu Soo Jung is really pretty
=
I'm overworked right now, so I shed tears while watching this stage. I love the extra cameo so much.
=
Americas ㅋㅇㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm sure you're a character
=
Cameo really liked ㅠㅠ Hidden masterpiece ㅠㅠ TT But when I look at this big stage, I really think of school days ㅠㅠ TT My heart trembles
=
This is Queendom's best love stage.
=
It's really true. This is Lovelyz. A concept that only Lovelyz can do.
=
3:10
=
I'm so cute !!!!!! I'm so crazy !!!!! I'm crazy ~ I've got my heart soaked.I'm really cute next to my cute sister next to my cute sister She has a cute sister
=
I've seen this a lot of times ... I thought this was similar to the omg girl and lovely color, but it's really different.
=
It's a addictive song. You can't listen to and study this once. Keep one-to-three shocks. Six Seven Eight.
=
Lovelyz stage is my favorite this round. The vocals are all clear voices, and the lyrics fit the high school musical style.
I like the late cake large and the perforator on my desk
=
ㅣ Already 줔 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Yeah yeah you're good at it ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠㅜ so pretty ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ and cameo lyrics are so good ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Why do you keep coming in?
=
I just like the ox brush tone
=
Lovelyz and Oh My Girl feel different
Oh My Girl feels sad and reminds me of the old love that my heart is tied "Oh ... I'm so sad. ㅠ"
Lovelyz is a bit clumsy when he was fresh, but it reminds me of my first love that I did my best.
=
After thinking again, from one morning
=
1:31 Elite Yuji Ae combo .. I fell in love with this bright but sad thing.
=
벱 Sol glasses are so good that you can digest. When I made my debut, Samsol was so pretty.
=
Lovelyz and other girl groups who are watching the stage seem to have the most comfortable expressions !!! It was a real Lovelyz stage, and the lyrics of Cameo are exquisitely expressed as if they were expressing Lovelyz in Queendom. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Really good Lovelyz ㅠㅠ
=
What is it?
=
I don't know how many times I watch this video
=
The song is so pretty. TT TT TT TT
=
I'm another fan and I like the song and the stage is good K It's like a squirrels I'm looking forward to the next stage
=
If you like cameo song, please listen to "Triangle" song! It's better to see it in a cross-edit video
=
I like the gel
=
What's your favorite Cameo song?
=
It's the best
=
This stage was so good and good.
=
I'm just sick of the people who've hit Lovelyz like somebody's guilty ... Why are you so uncomfortable? I'm so upset when you think that pretty, hard-working kids have seen that kind of stuff. I miss you
=
I smile all the time I see you ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Too lovely
=
The only video I keep watching during the Queendom stage
=
ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Look at the contributions of the artist ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Gin looks so much better than when I debuted
=
This time Lovelyz was lovelyz
An acclaimed omgirl fan but Lovelyz. The stage was good, too
=
So good!
=
The other members are pretty, but you can't wait to see me so pretty !! Eyeline
=
Oh, I'm so cute ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Lovelyz This stage is so good and different from the lyrics because of the high tension, it's so funny and sad .......... The Americas tension is too high, so I'm surprised and shouted at 4:59 No Dorahuaah What's that ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The stage was really good
I really like it because I like this stage. It's like watching a musical and I feel happy and happy
But suddenly you yell at me
=
I can do it well, but I'd like to ask Jill. The lyrics are talking about Lovelyz.
I sweared quite a bit before the contest.
=
I'm here again.
=
I don't know why 1:38 This part makes tears ㅠㅠㅠ ㅜㅠㅠㅠ Lovelyz I was so cool at this time ㅠㅠㅜㅠ I love you so much
=
It's not the most gorgeous but it's a stage I want to keep watching.
=
Where did this lovelyness come from?
=
I'm so happy that I'm creepy Teen musical style Lovelyz .. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I don't know how many times I see this
=
Why do I always tear my eyes with Lovely girls?
=
It's been a long time since I've had such a concept. From the past, I think a cappella is good but you can dance and take a cappella bright concept.
=
It's nothing but the Americas are getting better
=
The Americas are steamed
=
I listened to the sound source already! Hey! I'm sorry to hear that ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Licorice
=
3:22 Kidmill
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This lovelyz seems to show a really healthy youthfulness. Among the emotions I feel while watching the stage, it is fresh and not gorgeous, but I feel that I feel the fullness of the kernel. It's really just a healthy and bright fresh ㅋㅋㅋ I feel like the sadness of Lovelyz's sentiments has been more emphasized, and it was a renewal through this stage. If it was a love story that was really pure in Canlovelove, this cameo looks like a story of finding new love after a breakup. It was good to see the images that Lovelyz can show. I was worried that I was so ill on the stage last time, but I feel like I got up hard.
=
I think Laraland's five squats in the middle
=
4:21 Isn't he a biscuit fairy? So pretty !!!
=
0:58 Hull .. cute
=
I knew that I was good at this concept, but I'm really good at it.
=
4:58 This
Why are you pretending to be so pretty and suddenly a thick voice 롴 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ No! Come back ah ah ah ah ah hahaha
=
Wow, it's the first time I've seen my sister and I'm so cool and attractive.
=
Already share lol lol
=
Shouting ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Yeah, this is Lovelyz
=
It's the 5th place in the video that's soaring. It's a stage I really want to see again. ..
(+ Hull is now # 2)
=
It's a household concept.
=
Do you keep watching me?
=
Listening to me when I give you five is so lovely
=
1:17 Frowning hairs up and down
=
The stage is good, but the lyrics are really good
=
It's so exciting and so fun ㅋㅋㅋ Oh America was lovely !!!
=
Really so good this time. Let's do the concept well like this! Lovelyz is really refreshing
=
I feel like watching a teen musical while I feel so sad but the lyrics are so sad
=
The Americas are insane ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Papa! Kids who can't read it.
=
It would have been so good if I actually saw
=
I'm an ohm girl fan. I don't really play ohm girl stage. I'm just watching the stage. I'm not tired of hearing while listening to music.
=
It's a stage that makes me feel good every time I see other singers react too much
=
It's cute over the Americas
=
This is really Lovelyz. This is it. Teams with too strong strength put themselves on the limit, and then get off the limit. Bibliography One Shot Caught
=
Americas ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ No way back and come back ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
???: This rat ~~ !!!
=
I see at least ten times a day
=
Hahahaha
=
I listened to my friend's recommendation.
=
I'm too steep for the Americas
=
I really enjoyed this contest. It's so cool to have a legend for every Queendom group.
=
I really did it on this stage
=
Hyejung looks so good ... Oh yeah.
=
Everyone is good at Americas
=
This is the stage that only Lovelyz can do, but I love this unique love .... ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I'm a good group, but I tried various concepts. I'm upset, I'm not a fan
=
1:15 It's so funny to hold the camera after the K part.
=
Huh? Screaming ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Do you think that only the lyrics go with me?
=
I didn't listen to the song, but I heard it once.
=
This is this
=
The Luz Leeds is not incapable. Really, however, in Queendom, they tried to fit colors that didn't match them so much that their abilities seemed to have fallen off. The feeling of dim feeling was so good. Anyway, I could do much better if I pulled out that part more !! I'm glad this stage is showing Lubbies' unique color ㅠ Cameo song ㅇㅇ .. !!!!
=
This stage is so pretty and the melody is pretty.
=
Ryu Sujeong is so pretty and fresh ... I only see Ryu Sujeong.
=
At the end of the ending, Ms. Mi is like a princess character who is in charge of gag, and K came out like a miracle.
=
I feel heavy with the lyrics that I'm just a bridesmaid. I hope that I can work well without getting hurt in the future.
=
Gin's mouth is so cute
=
Even when the reaction comes out sometimes? I'm so pretty when I come out, but my eyes kept going, but I think I've fallen in love with the world this time.
=
When I see you, I smile naturally
=
It's so pretty. You're steamed. You're so pretty.
=
This song is really new and I hope people will know more about this opportunity.
=
Moonlight and cameo so good
=
The last Americas are so cute that we will see more than OH 500 million times ...
=
It's a very pleasant stage.❤
=
Already 줔 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅅㅂㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I keep seeing a lot of things on the recommendation list, but I watch them every day.
=
My sister and the american sister are so pretty
Of course the other members are pretty ..
Sister's glasses look good on you
My sister's ribbon is so pretty
Jin sister is so cute
=
It's like K Dorami
=
Like this stage is a gel, the name is really lovely
=
Personally, I think it's best expressed like Mamamu on the theme of this Pandora's Box.
=
1:03 So this is it !!!!
=
I'll just say a word. Ost
=
cute.
=
Wow, it's really pretty
=
Even if you're a fan, you can't wait to see the performance of `` Mellow Sun '' from the time of Cangelup.It's really happy to see the performances. I did my best when I was 3 and showed me a real Lovelyz.
=
After all it is lovely !!!! I'm serious.❤❤❤❤❤
=
04:06 Perfect
=
It's because I'm over-immersed in otaku day
=
It's so good ㅠㅠㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ
=
It's really hot
=
1:18 It was so nice and funny to show you here after Kay. Yes, they were steamed.
=
If you think that you've been suffering from Lovelyz,
=
It is true that one day sees this stage and finishes it comfortably.
=
I saw this and the whole world shrank.
Of course, let's leave the host for the next stage.
=
K Cheerleader clothes are so pretty.
=
1.5 million views
=
This concept is much better. So far the best in the Queendom stage.
=
I'm not a Lovelyz fan. I just didn't know why the fans said you are good at it. But now you know
=
Ah ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Everyone rewind is also a song.
=
How many times do you see ..
=
I just laugh because it's so cute
It goes so well with the concept
Cute as if I saw a teen movie ...
Especially Ryu Sujeong seems to melt well naturally
This lovely stage is so cute and so pretty I love you so much
=
They're kids too, aren't Jimin's Lovely Lovers?
=
No ~ (girl girl) Come back ~~ This is so cute
=
Jin's mouth is so pretty !!!
=
It's sad to see the lyrics, but I'm happy to see this stage.
=
I really like this musical stage, the group that expresses the lyric lyrics brightly, Lovelyz seems to be the best. .. Real Lovelyz is the best when you stage with a color that only Lovelyz can do !!!
=
It's a concept that only Lovelyz can do, and it's something that Lovelyz should be proud of. It's only Lovelyz that digests this concept and goes well together.
=
Why do I see this tears ... The lyrics are sad and sad but the atmosphere is so exciting and so sad that the kids are enjoying their stage, and now I'm like a cameo. Everybody shines so much
=
When I saw this stage, I remembered the day I encountered
=
Please just give me a bell once Lovelyz and you of the day ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'd love to see the kids stage, but aren't there too many reaction stakes?
=
I feel like an amusement park
=
Ryu Soo Jung
=
Who's wearing baseball pants on my sister?
=
America is crazy ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Wow, this is so good ... this concept is so pretty, lovely and perfect.
=
This is ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The number of bibliography is any rice cake
=
Everyone, this is our crystal. TT TT TT TT Real crystal, it was a stage shining like your name.
=
Citation Count Fan
=
I watch videos every day ...
=
K-half Bundle of Ribbon Pin Isn't it too pretty?
=
How many times do you see?
=
1:15 Grab the camera and shine the camera. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Sad but bright and spirited! haha
Lovelyz seems to be a healing group
Your favorite song of the day After it's in your mouth!
=
When I look at the stage, it feels like being clean
=
This stage was great.
=
2:22 He's too big to jump up and only sees him after kind Mr.
=
I'm not a fan to watch this stage, but I'm crying, but they're hard working.
=
It's all pretty
=
I'm not a Lovelyz fan, it's Miracle.
I'm really sick of it. I decided to show you what kids can do well. .. Oh, it's a real book. Lyrics are so sad.
=
All the time, "This is this, this is it." Keep saying. The feelings that Lovelyz did best. I think you've been working hard.
=
Arranged too well
What I did at the concert was to put the sound of the instrument in the AR itself (?) As well as the melody part.
=
The lyrics are so sad, but why are you happy when you're on stage?
=
I've been to Lovelyz .. ㅠㅠ I love you sisters
=
This video is a drug.
=
I've been a fan since I debuted, but I was going to tears while watching this stage. I love you so much and I love you all the time. Lovelyz is the best. Thank you for showing good stage every time.
=
The choreography is much better than the original song.
=
It's good because it goes so well together
=
Jimin's reaction is so cute❤️
=
It was so good. In my heart, this team was number one ...
=
I've been so pretty here since I saw Jisoo Webed.
=
I suddenly miss school days.
=
Ryu Soo-jung .. so pretty .....
=
Original concept for Lovelyz It was so cute and I felt so good all day long! Originally Idol was not interested in a group called Lovelyz for the first time I was so good group ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Cute !!!
=
It's like seeing a real musical number.
With only greed that they want to do well, ignoring their characteristics
Sixth Sense of the Past Stage with New Focus
After realizing it, he made use of his characteristics and strengths.
Dramatic stage cameo
=
No index so pretty
=
Do you know what are the three most precious golds in the world?
Right now with cash, deposits, and lovelys.
=
It was so good to see at the scene but I was worried about how it would look on the air but it was so good to see it on the air ㅠㅠ Too hard for me It was the best ~~~ ♡ ♥ ♡ ♥ ♡ ♥ ♡ ♥
=
This is Lovelyz This is ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Last time I made up for this.
=
This is it !!! I want to tell you that you've worked hard ㅠㅠㅠ Lovelyz seems to express Lovely as the group name best
=
Is Kay really a doll?
=
Wow ..... it feels like a teen musical .....
=
After all I hear it and love it ♥
=
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
=
I loved it so much
=
3 o'clock in the morning before going to bed. haha
=
It's so good that other groups love it, but it's good.
=
I see only Hwasa and Ca ..... Hwasa So Sweet ... Kah So Sweet.
=
I think I'm going to write a poem because I'm so sad.Lovelys.
=
Lyrics for me
=
Baby Soul glasses look like Park Seulgi ㅋㅋ (Reporter)
=
This was the perfect stage that was called Lovelyz ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I love you Lovelyz
=
Song Lyrics is like the Queen's stage of Lovelyz
=
Yeah this is the best
=
Ryu Sujeong is so charming and pretty ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm coming to hear it again
=
I've picked up all the Lovelyz songs since Candy Jelly Love, but this youthful and innocent song can't beat Lovelyz.
=
This concept is right, but do what you want to do. I love Lovelyz.
=
If you really like the cameo song this time, you should listen to the "triangle"
=
0:50 Here's my awkward arm, my awkward line, and I'm coming back to see it, especially because of the costume.
=
I'll keep coming back to see you again
=
Why can't anybody talk about it?
=
I was able to see a lot more advanced. Feeling a bit Everland? > <
=
Yes, I'm pretty.
=
Yuji Ae's dog is pretty ...
=
I have to go download music. It was a real Pandora's box.
=
1:12 It looks like it's lovely to look at the camera when you're at Kay.
=
I'm still on the popular chart.
=
I'm practicing one video a day ... I'm not really tired.
=
The remake is original and the stage is so cute and cute.
=
I loved this song from the beginning, but the stage was so bright and well done. This is a stage that can only be lovelyz.
=
This is Lovelyz ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
But the Americas ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Very cute ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
This is this Lovelyze is this
=
The Americas are so funny Oh ...
=
Each one is so lovely
=
I'm going to do this well
=
It's great to have a concept that fits you well and to show your strengths to the maximum
=
Lovelyz I really love it
=
I discovered the sweetness of the day
=
I think it's OST! ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Songs are so good❤️
=
1:15 Kay doll scene I want to leave behind
=
It's a bright song, sad lyrics Lovelyz ... This time I think it's really good. I really liked the song of Lovelyz unrequited love
=
Wow ... I feel like I was remembered as a teenager now. When I was in school, there was a student chairman named Jason.
=
If you don't fit in with other concepts, I can tell you, but you shouldn't mock or swear at all.
=
3:23 Vincent
=
This is only Lovelyz
=
I'm not a cameo if you look at her tension.
=
Chews in the Americas
=
It was the best stage because I knew that I could do my best without being overly challenging.
=
I did well this time
This is Lovelyz
=
Why are you telling me these masterpieces now? ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Really cute, fresh and fun. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Pretty Kilpo still shoots !!!!!!
=
Lovelyz-chan, so cool
=
The American ribbon Pink Ribbon is so nice
It looks so pure
=
It's a bit of a musical atmosphere
=
I'm a real elite, I'm pretty upside down
=
Wow, I really wanted Lovelyz to change the image and change the image.
Don't gas light if you're looking for a centipede;
=
Lovelyz was lovelyz
=
This seems to be the real Lovelyz index This time, the awareness of Lovelys has changed. It was a stage where all the members were shining.
=
I'm not in the ending already! When I was having a hard time laughing at the other kids ..
=
걍 The tone is choppy All the members are attractive
=
This is really Lovelyz No.1 ...
=
Replying to @SamsungSamsung
=
Lovelyz❤
=
No ~~~ Come back !!!! ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I love you sisters.
=
Lovelyz Cameo is great
=
A day I discovered
TV drama report titled "Extra characters try to change their destiny"
I came to Queendom and saw this.
=
It's a magic that keeps looking.
=
I'm here to listen again. Cameo is addicted.
=
1 day 1 no return
=
Why is it all English?
I personally think the Americas did a hard carry lol
=
K is pretty.
=
I tried to watch it a few times but I keep seeing it ...
=
It's a buddy, but Lovelyz guys, I'm watching the Queen's stage very well. Everyone is so beautiful. Fight the last stage tomorrow.
=
It's nice to feel something musical ...
=
Ryu Soojung's tone is so good
=
It's Lovelyz. Right. Lovelyz.
That's pretty :) This is Lovelyz
First of all, the Americas are so good ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Please ring up one more sound with this ..
=
This is Lovelyz
=
The Americas are so cute LOL LOL LOL LOL Come back!!!!!
=
Even though I'm not a Lovelyz fan, I've seen him laughing all the time.
=
There are few parts in the index.
=
If you like the hidden cameo cameo, listen to the triangle.
=
Bobonjin Lovelyz So good Lovelyz fighting
=
This is the only concept that's really lovely ... I love you pure love
=
1 cameo per day
=
Well done sisters ... black and black
=
K When are you pretty?
=
good luck, fire
=
Ah, the Americas ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Too good luck ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ The only thing you can sing this sad lyrics like lively is Lovez
=
It's so much better because it's baby voice guidance.
=
Cute and youthful and nice and done ... I'll show you more of these stages ...
=
I was smiling too
=
I've been called Pandora
Lovelyz seems to be the height ㅠㅠ ... I think all day, the song is really good.
=
Achu Six Sense and Yein and Kay Cameo have been struggling a lot. Cameo is a favorite song. It was so pretty and it was like watching a music video! Thank you so much for holding the mental, and thank you for the jeongyi started well, and Kay sings with a pretty voice, and it is refreshing because you sing and talk with both Yea and Jiae! Jisu's facial acting is fascinating! Thank you for the atmosphere in the middle and the end. I always support beautiful and wonderful lovely girls.
=
Why doesn't anyone mention elites?
Jeong In-in is a really introverted and kind schoolboy, but she is so lovely and popular, but she feels like a high school student who doesn't know her .. ㅠㅠ
This costume is the best .. Please wear it once more .. !!
=
Jimin reaction = My reaction ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
K Hello Kitty resembles
=
It's so pretty and lovely. It was so cute and lovely.
=
I've eaten the first and second swear words so far
AOA loves writing so I don't feel bad about it.
Lovelyz Don't expect this time, but don't expect it. Instead of third place, it's enough to be the first place.
=
No way at last ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Come back and laugh. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ It's so innocent on stage.
=
2:44 Serge Su Hyun
=
I saw you again today ~~
=
Kay's look and voice are bright, cute and innocent.
=
Americas ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm so pretty.
=
As America is a visual top, my face is the prettiest
=
3:22 Kidmill
=
Jiae is a fluffy student wearing a gym suit under a skirt and feels a popular student. And Park Myung is a cheerleader who dies.
=
z blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
=
I'm going to see you again because I like Cameo.
=
How these faces are cameo
=
Ryu Soo Jung is really pretty .....
=
Even though I'm not a fan
=
This is true even for other fans. Lovelyz The concept I brought this is the best fit and looks pretty.
=
With 1 million views!
=
One day, one cameo ... I didn't even know who was in Lovelyz.
=
I'm listening to other stations, but I keep watching and thinking about it .....
=
Jean Forked
=
I didn't know Lovelyz but I thought Six Sense wasn't able to sing or clip. But this stage changed my thinking. I want to reflect on myself.
=
It feels like the stage as a whole
Plump and musical feeling
=
I haven't been looking for a Queendom performance since Six Sense, but I was surprised to see a cameo.
=
05:00 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Oh, I really feel good when I listen to this song. I am happy because I only remember happy memories. So I come to hear it all the time.
=
Lovelyz seems to be a cute concept
=
Yes, it's you who are good at singing foolish lyrics ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's the fifth anniversary in November, can you be so lovely?
Lovelyz is a real lovely queen innocent queen
This Queen's new song Moonlight is pop
The song was really good and the vocal distribution was fresh and awesome
=
It's good. This stage .. I'm going crazy ..
=
Okay, I came back. I found my color. What do you think about that comment?
=
Wow, this was my song, and it was a song that nobody around me knew.
=
Musical Version Both original Melon Yesterday's chart
=
Musical
=
Yes Lovelyz did well! You say this, one. What else do you need
=
The Americas are all alive lol.
=
The world is harmless. Purely itself.
=
CROSSOO ZOLA Pretty
=
Seo soo nice and pretty
=
So far, I'm so happy with the Queen Queen stage. I hope I can see more of these stages.
=
Lovelyz is unique and bright, but the sad atmosphere makes the songs and singers pretty and dim.
=
This sounds like a good musical
=
You're so pretty.
=
The crystal is really pretty. This time it's like a headband and Snow White.
=
Screaming
It's so cute that I can hear the waiting room
=
3:15 Is this in the original song as well? LOL Laugh!
=
I was worried about watching this video after watching Lovelyz Six Sense. I don't know the stage but I think Lovelyz's most special point and strength is that it brings out various emotions in a bright song.
=
Lovelyz is not very good and did not fit the last time because I do not want to swear too much ㅠㅠ challenge is not bad!
=
I screamed at the parts of the US and boarded the train to Ipdeok ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ❤️
=
I'm listening
I'm bored because I can't hear the endnote
=
I want to write it for a day .. It's like a song expressing the situation
=
I don't know why this stage is tears
=
I wonder if Jimin is in the Americas.
=
The stage and the members are so pretty ... ㅎㅎ
=
1st degree
=
It was the most loved song I've ever had.
=
Missoa ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The background and the costume choreography are all like a teen movie or a drama summer festival.
=
Lovelyz Stage Legend
=
I do not like it. The proportion reminds me of the reaction that singer female fans showed to singer Kang Su-ji more than 20 years ago. There is also something in common. It's a singer who has been different since more than 20 years. I don't know if it's a coincidence, but both are debuted by Yoon Sang (One Piece).
=
Ryu Soo Jung ㅋㅇ I'm pretty headband
=
I feel better after watching the full healing video
=
Serge Su seems to be really good at interpreting the concept ... Honestly, Serge Su was very noticeable in the ending scene ... Kay was just so cute and America was funny and cute.
=
I'm smiling all the time ... I smiled and dried my gums. I really smiled so much.
=
Your sister is so pretty
=
The coolness goes away from the Disney song
=
왱 I don't mean Jisoo! I'm pretty.
=
Based on what they're good at, they're never fed up. It was so good
=
This competition was so good and good
It was a contest that clearly showed Lovelyz
Look at each other's voices
It's the feeling when I first got to know Lovelyz❣️
=
It feels like the atmosphere is a bit broken because the Americas shout ~~ The song and the stage are the best
=
The index is pretty pretty this time
=
I can only hear this song.
=
It's like a musical on the other hand :)
=
This is
=
Lovelyz only do the music of Lovelyz You don't have to go along
=
Yeah, this is Lovelyz ... I don't have a group like this concept
=
Is the captain of the sports department? My sister is dying
=
I envy him
=
YEON's "I know the name" is so good.
=
2 million gazah
=
This concept is much better than Attuna Six Sense.
Cameo keeps coming to see the stage
Feeling good
=
Replying to @JustinLeeYeoh I'm so cute haha ​​I'm so cute ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Since kind Mr. Jinja, I can only see you.
=
Yeah, Lovelyz is lovely and the gap is more like the last big voice of America
=
I've come here from a day .. Good song.
=
The clown is poking a hole in the cloud. Someone give me a clown. I think I'm too intimate. How can you make me so cute and adorable?
=
In fact, it was a lovely stage backed up with half anxiety and half anxiety.
Perfect for Rubbly! Lovely, youthful, cute, and ㅠ You can enjoy the concept together. This is it !!!!!
Lovely Lopley has come back and took the legend. It's really amazing .. It's a musical .. It's a musical.
=
It's so fresh ♥♥
=
Teen Concept looks so good !! It was great to see the stage cameo up to 8 people! Lovelyze fighting!
=
It's about 20 seconds. I feel like watching a western show in the 1900s.
=
Please don't install the Axler ..
=
The stage looks fine.
=
So good
=
Honestly, I was so disappointed in the contest that I didn't expect much in this contest, but I am so good at surprise that people feel that they have to do what they are good at.
=
I didn't know it.
=
ㅠㅠㅠ What are you so lovely, let's express the cuteness with words
Would it be lovely if ...? ... ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ No Lee Soo Jung horns .. I'm so cute ,,,,
=
This is !!!!!!!
=
Jean is so good
=
No, come back
=
Ryu Soo-jung's voice is more than ...
=
4:19 Yes, only stages that can really be loved.
It would have been hard for me because of the bad guys.
Lovelyz!
=
Something is healing
=
Lovelyz ㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ
=
I want to make friends with her. Cheer up.
=
Lovelyz simply 'innocent' and 'chealy' is not the concept, I really know right now, I'm sure it's more than just innocent, happy .. The lyrics are sad but the atmosphere is flickering.
=
The concept fits nicely, but the stage itself is well designed. Firmly
=
Really cute
=
Shout out !!!
=
Americas
=
I'm so pretty, I'm so pretty ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ In addition, it's cool and handsome ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I think I really saw a Broadway musical.
=
The song is attractive and addictive
Coming every day
=
Suh Ji Soo seems to be good at facial expressions every day.
=
I just listened to the song of Lovelyz and didn't know her face.
=
Lovelyz was really good.
It's good because it's a favorite song
=
Look at all the girls' generations that Lovelyz covered.
https://youtu.be/1wbDDHhDyyY
=
Yu Ji-ae's voice
=
I was so good. I wish I had gone to this feeling in the first step.
=
This song is the most popular song, but it's good to be known ㅠㅠ wow album There are so many good songs at that time
=
1:18 Our expression
=
The song is so good and it fits so well with Lovelyz that I keep watching it.
=
No what ??? Wait a minute ... I thought the restaurant was omg girl, but there were songs like this in the song. I'm so sorry for this, so sorry.
=
It's my favorite song of cameo lovelys.
=
The song is really good. I don't do it like this ... TT TT I think it's included in WoW.
=
Thank you queen
=
When you look at it, you smile out of it ...
=
I don't care about wearing underwear. Mnet repeats that twice again
=
1:57 Looks like KidMill Vincent.
=
I love you sisters
=
I showed it to nerdy people who don't know how lovely Lovelyz is. ♡
=
So good
=
I am so acting and pretty.
=
Seo Ji-soo, because you're acting better facial expressions lol
=
One million soon.
=
This is Lovelyz
=
Baby Soul will wear some pretty glasses.
=
It looks like a musical ...
=
At last, the flower delivered by the male dancer is crying in the part that the female dancer (the main character) receives, not the lovely one (cameo). There's a feeling of sadness that melts in it. It's a lovely one. It's not like anything else. This includes songs like mind and cleverness.
=
3:22 sec fat kid mill
=
I've seen my crystal sister since a few years ago, but I'm getting more beautiful as well as my singing ability. And I'm a towing concept.
=
The person called Yein is very pretty
=
Refreshing
=
If you look at Yuna's reaction
This is ... This is ...
=
I watched all three videos of Queen's Lovelyz, but Lovelyz's concept fits
=
Personally, the performance is the best I've ever seen, but it's not high.
=
He comes to see every day,
=
I've been playing songs with a pure feel since my debut, so I'm sure that I want other senconcepts too. I'm not really doing this.
=
This time, I did it well. Songs and lyrics.
=
But why did you wear those glasses of baby soul? Your face looks more bloated and your eyes look narrower. You'd be better off wearing elite glasses.
=
I'm 6 years old, can you do that lovely?
=
YEON is good at acting.
=
Personally, this stage was the best. But the melody is bright, but the lyrics are only cameo .. ng .. I want to be good.
=
I'm just creepy but sad
=
ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's like this This is the most disgusting
=
Don't panic! I will always support you :)
=
Lovelyz is not showing a good gall compared to other groups, but ㅠㅠ Lovelyz is like this ~ Lovelyz albums When you listen in winter
=
Stage
=
The public is the first to write gas lighting. It's all saying you're good. You are good at this. Just do this ... Lovelyz knew the field well.
=
I don't like people. I came in to press it, but instead I ate it in. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅅ
=
When you look at K-part, you are excited about something .;
=
Drug video
=
It's such a good thing, but it's a pity that Six Sense and Achu's sexy version seemed to show only worse images
The skills are good and the possibilities are endless, so I want you to show a lot better stages!
=
The man is so handsome but please let me know some information.
=
What do you think ... It's a bit like a plum.
=
cute
=
Everyone looks at the stage looks like their parents came to see their daughters lol (I think)
=
Wow, it's a real musical lol
=
It's so pretty and cute ??
=
Lovelyz wanted to make a cappella with Queendom, but it's just fine to see it ... I love you, Lovelyz ... If you want to see a teen movie, I'll just look at it now ...
=
Sometimes the joyous looking and joyous Ajae ... uncles and tataku.
=
What time did you get over a million?
=
Oh, the more I listen, the sad, happy, cute, and addictive I am.
=
cute
=
Gang is so pretty!
=
I thought it would be nice to have a triangle, but cameo is also a favorite song. There is a color that only Lovelyz can do.
=
Was it buildup for this stage so far?
=
This is Lovelyz ~
=
Where did you go for the exponent part?
=
Lovelyz Do you think it would be safe to make me run like this?
=
I think about it
=
Addictive dog
=
It's a happy ending where a man confesses to a woman but ends in a cameo. I don't think it's just a bright song of sad lyrics, but rather a song that better fits the title of cameo.
=
It's a big one. The America's contact always doesn't slip.
=
It looks so good
=
So pretty ~ ♡
=
It's been a while, but it's been 22-24 years since I made my debut in 2014 .... ;;
=
I can only wear glasses with Ji-ae and Ye-in.
=
0:43 General Hyejeong's reaction, are you laughing at me?
=
This song is addictive
=
Lovelyz Honestly, I'm the best, Miju ㅋㅇ Power Entertainment ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Really good ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣ ❣
=
Lovelyze Fighting
=
Lovelyz finally pulled out the secretary's weapon Lovelyz was so good it was the best I love you ❣️❣️
=
I love the stage Lovelyz
=
Ipujan is also a lovely gel
=
Why do you think I'm going to tears in this box? It's a real Pandora's box.
=
Ryujeong ,,,,,,,,,, so pretty ,,,,,,,, complete Netflix ,,,,,,,,,
=
I'm going to keep watching Yo-Ko-Yo ... Last time I wish you were gay.
=
Lovelyz's peculiar bright, but sad and dim feeling is so good .. Especially, I love singing so much .... Bright and dim. I think it's the stage of ending love .. It's like weaving a shawl. It feels like the shawl finishes the heart at the finishing stage. Cameo also knows through Queendom for the first time. I love singing. Bright but when I want to see me. It melts well ... I'm sharing the first place with my mama in a bright but foolish way.
=
I feel like I've been watching a real teen drama a season. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ So cool and so good.
=
Crystal and the Americas are so good.
=
Wow, towing and Jia-chan This is so pretty
I think it's a choice
=
There's a lot of comments about Lovelyz Jin's mouth.
My lips are thin and my mouth is up
I've always been told that my mouth is pretty since my debut.
=
Innocent is a very toxic, but other concepts are also very good .. I've done a lot on the stage that I've been doing so much .. Let's not lock the concept of Lovelyz ..
=
I think it's an all-time class on the stage of Lovelyz.
=
I'm a big fan and I'm so excited about the Lovelyz stage. I'm going to keep watching this style song and the stage.
=
When I listen to Lovelyz songs, I feel like I'm in love with each other, and I'm pretty innocent and pretty .. And there's almost no useless English and the lyrics are so pretty.
=
Lovelyz is a team like a comprehensive gift set.
=
It's really best. You're good at it.
=
It's bright, but it's a lovely feeling
=
It's so cute and refreshing, bright and so good., ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I love you sisters.
=
I think of the lyrics completely
=
And really good
I've seen it now. It wasn't just part of the time when I held each of my members, but I missed the timing.
=
Yeah, it goes well.
=
It's so cute to shake it with the hair ribbon in the beginning of K. So I keep coming. ㅠㅠ Cute ㅠㅠㅠ
=
1:16 I'm laughing while waving the ribbon .. I'm so cute. Kimkei took all my heart. TT ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ TT My favorite stage is the stage where I'm happy after Lovelyz.
=
Hahahaha
=
2:42. 4:15 Really crazy
I keep coming in because of this scene.
=
I'm really in love with this teen girl
=
Ah Hyejung ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's so cute ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Real virtue-filled stage I'm looking for a reason why I started Lovelyz virtue ㅠㅠ
=
I didn't know Lovelyz, but it's really cute with your group name?
=
The end of the Americas
=
It looks so good
=
Yeah ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I need to do something like this Lovelyz
=
I'm really into Lovelyz thanks to the real Queendom ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
This time the Americas are so good.
=
This song is so good. It's a bit like a day.
=
Ugh, this is so crazy
=
0:24 I missed the timing of the crystal, so I stayed when the camera was shining.
=
This is an atmosphere that goes really well with Lovelyz. I think it would be nice to have done it like this in the future.
=
Really Lovelyz This concept goes well together.
=
It's cute to shake your body softly 1:14
=
5:01 I'm smiling right next to the Americas.
=
The afterglow is really so bad
=
Jimin's kitchen last week !! Yell at the end of America!
=
It's so beautiful and pretty in the background too. It's so beautiful and beautiful.
=
From the first to the last,
one two three four five six seven eight ~
Why is surfing so good?
=
It's been so long in popular videos !! Please try hard to your million, !!
=
Very good tone in chorus
=
I'm spinning 10 times a day lol
=
Seriously, every time I see you, I feel so good Lovelyz Fighting ㅠㅠ
=
I'm so cute
=
Jin, she's pretty ... ?? I'm tall too ... Was that pretty?
=
The song is good and the dance is pretty
=
This is Lovelyz
=
You are so pretty with Jeong Yein.
=
You're lovely. ㅠㅠㅠ I washed all my heartbeats during the sixth sense. ㅠㅠㅠ Cute and lovely colors. It's a unique color. I thought it was so pretty when I was on the web drama
=
Addicted and tired
=
In the past, I was a group I only wanted to know, but now I want to know everyone in the world.
=
Oh, I came to see you again today
=
I like the tone.
=
Elite real dog
=
Song cute
=
Lovelyz is memorable for a long time because of the elements planted quietly, even if it looks a little impactless, as evidenced by the towing unit stage.
=
Lovelyz❤
=
This is the theme song of the day.
=
It's really lovely.
=
I feel better naturally
=
Wow ... the elite beauty is ant ...
=
ㄹㅇ The name of the group ... Ah .. Really musical and added loveliness is the color of Lovelyz really lovely
=
Lovelyz is like this.
=
1:56 Kidmill?
=
I know it's Lovelyz.
=
I think this is something that only Lovelyz can do. I can't do other groups.
And the last one is really fun
Killing point ... ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Oh, I'm missing Korean. Whatever my sisters are doing, I'm happy to see the stages they rolled. I've seen this stage so well.
I don't need it all ... My sisters are awesome ... I love you ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Do you have a laugh therapist? When I look at my sisters, I smile and my gums are dry
=
I think there are two meanings of cameo in the song. One is that the man who is really in love is the protagonist. Compared to) you are black without any presence (cameo-> black)
=
Please give me the triangle once. Sincere lyrics are so good.
=
Wow ..... I've only seen this a few times .. The lyrics are really touching with my unrequited love. Real kids are so pretty.
=
Wow, the stage was good. I was waiting for this stage.
=
And it's really sad
I'm so good, Lovelyz. I love you so much. I love you.
=
It looks like this
=
Congratulations on rising 2nd place. I was worried that I could still see some bad guys.
=
Who is it? / Not America!
=
4:24 You're standing in ages.
=
Please listen to Lovelyz Queendom new song moonlight too ~~~~
=
I watched the Queen's stage for the first time, and I honestly don't know what kind of team it is. But I really enjoyed this stage. The shouts of the tree of the Americas really laughed out. It seems that I can now see the color of the team.
=
3:28 Honestly, I thought it was going to be exciting to take off the glasses and take them off. But only the glasses are in the backpack .... ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Like Lovelyz Achu, there are many songs that contain youthful and sad contents.
=
03:55 The arrangement is so good from here.
=
I don't like this concept from the beginning ㅠㅠ Oh My Girl's Innocent and Lovelyz Innocent are different ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I watched this show and it seemed like my self-esteem fell after the last contest.
=
Actually cameo is a sad and sad song
I'm curiously intertwined with this situation in Queendom
It was really sad to see you, but I sublimate it like this.
I want to see you in my heart.
As a team called Lovelyz
As a favorite fan of all eight of them,
I want to say that I am always cheering.
For me, Lovelyz is always the main character.
=
There's a lot of stories about Lovelyz's coming out of Queendom. Actually, I only know a few songs and a group called Lovelyz and almost didn't know the member's name. I think it's good to be here.
=
Lovelyz doesn't just sing brightly, so I think bright and refreshing isn't down. Day & Night-Doll-Circle-Temptation-Rewind-Secret Love
=
It's a lovely feeling that can't be followed even by other groups. Lovelyz Let's make fans happy with beautiful song dance hearts !!!
=
I hope to come back to ost the day I accidentally discovered. I think I can float more with the drama
=
It fits well with the theme of a real Pandora's Box.
=
It's so good. It's so cute. It's so cute. Lovelyz's refreshing tones cleanse my heart all the time.
=
Every single member looks happy. Make the viewer happy
=
If you look at the costumes, and you are in front of the gate,
The Americas look at me like you know
=
It makes me feel good to see it. This is really great. Lovelyz is such a great group.
=
Yoo Ji-ae's head that suits dogs
Please wear glasses all your life TT TT TT TT
=
Last time Lovelyz I think that people who swear so much compliment me here, I feel creepy all over the body .. Some criticism can be, but too many swear words.
=
I'm a big fan, but I'm lovely every time I see Lovelyz. I'm always a good group. TT TT Kim K. I'm so squirrel and Ryu Su-jeong. I'm like a pure cartoon character.Jin is an amusement park. From the Ferris wheel, TT TT sol is the original song cameo from all over the world comecomin glasses are so cute. I'm trying to run a lot. I hope you don't get hurt.
=
It's my favorite song. It looks so good and cute ㅠㅠㅠ Very good ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I want to see 10 times and see 100 times.
=
Shout in the middle !!!! I think this is the end of the flow
Cameo's ending now and it's really over.
After the end I will accept everything !!
=
Did I think it's strange, why do you think about it?
=
I think Lovelyz is the best color for this group.
=
It's really nice to keep up with.
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋ Who's the ending?
=
This concept is the best
=
Oh so pretty ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Real concept
=
I really like this song
=
Rubbly did it.
=
All members are so cute TT ㅠㅠ What doll K looks like .. America is really high tension ㅋㅋㅋ Stage production songs are all good in the midst of the song lyrics sympathy ㅠㅠ
=
My Jin sister is pretty you really awesome pretty ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It feels like a musical so it's different and so good!
=
2:44 I feel like I'm a hitter
=
I can only think of a song crying
=
It's a lovely season.
=
It's so nice ... Thank you so much for the last lovely concept.
=
Knit it too much ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Lovelyz concept was really good
=
So cute
=
I was sorry that I couldn't interpret the song last time, but this time I made the stage that I can do best so I keep coming back
=
Imju ㅋ ㅋㅌㅌㅋ ㅌㅌㅌㅌ ㅌㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Lol lol
=
No ~~~ Come back ㅠ
=
Baby Soul, sadness resembles TT TT TT Cute ㅠㅠㅠ ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
Favorite song
=
I'm attracted to you
=
The goal was first, but it was worth third. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
=
I thought Lovelyz was the best thing I was doing ~
=
Song is so good
=
Nice stage !! ❤❤❤
=
I want to see you at the year-end awards
=
And it's not going down in the soaring popularity. In fact, I'm repeating myself. The listener will be happy.
=
Lovely and pretty
=
I keep coming to see you ;;;
=
I think about it
=
So it's good how it's Rubbish ... They also saw the Six Senses comments and said "Oh our concept is not this".
=
, 미죾 ㅋ ㄱㄱㄱㄱ ㅈㅋ ㄱㅈㄱ ㅈㄱㅈㄱ ㅈㄱㅈㄱ
=
I look at your eyes and tremble, so I secretly keep hiding.
=
It's really glee and cute ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Feel good Why do you eat vitamins Lovelyz is a human vitamin?
=
Oh, I came to see you again
=
Oh my love, guys
=
It's like a musical ... Lovelyz is this ...
=
I think this concept is right for our lovely sisters !!
Last time Queen Queen was sad because only Lovelyz wasn't attracted, but today's stage is very attractive !! I love you!! lovelyz!!
=
Even if I see it, I'm lovely
=
I think it's a lovely color
=
I thought it would have been really nice if you gave me this concept ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Too bad ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Scream!
=
Lovelyz cameo stage was really good .. Really .. It was a stage that only children's members could do.
=
This is a lovely thing.
=
Baby Soul, it's the same sadness ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Be cute ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Park Myung is a bipedal. Oh, I'm pretty. I really don't love cheerleaders.
=
I did this bright song at last ㅠㅠ I smiled all the time to see the real thing ㅠㅠ I love how I look like this I've always had a lot of bad guys I've always had this look ㅠㅠㅠ Lovelyz did well! The Americas are really cute
=
This is it!
=
I don't think the stage is my taste but this is the number one in my heart.
=
I'm Hye Yeong, I'm so pretty. The glasses are amazing.
=
I'm really beautiful, this stage is so pretty, everyone is so pretty.
=
The sound source doesn't shout with Hay of the Americas, so I keep coming back to see it. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ The sound source feels something empty ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm just thinking that Novrain is really happy
=
Lovelyners firepower was too weak this time. Originally, Lovelyners firepower was so big.
=
The composition of the stage is so cute TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT Lyrics are so cute and well suited ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I think I'm looking for their color so I love it ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I have been certified as a live photo of Lee Joo Lee ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Lovelyz Honestly, I did 4th place of Six Senses last time.
=
It would've been nice if we could have been Lovelyz first.
=
Good song
=
I've been so good at this stage. I thought Lovelyz could do this well as a fan, but I didn't think it was right for us. And our Lovelyners only liked the bright concept of sisters and people loved this stage, which is the color of Lovelyz. No, it's not a bright concept that it's really lovely. Our loves have always been loves. It's a lovely stage that's been criticized. It's a lovely stage. I hope you don't limit Lovelyz to just one concept. As I said above, all stages are the colors that Lovelyz has and the identity of Lovelyz. One thing I want to say is that the public cannot like all aspects of Lovelyz. The criticism of the stage, of course, but can I do it, please if the accusations are designed LOVELYZ do not deny you like gin
=
This is Lovelyz ...
=
Ah haha. Twin tail is cute and dies ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's like a musical stage, with all the elements that Lovelyz's doing well, especially the background of fireworks at the end. I felt like I saw the climax of the movie.
=
Ryu Sujeong ... She's something ... Maybe I made it 7 days and nights when God made Ryu Sujeong ..... 00:40 At first, I was in a teen musical I was sung by my mother after being sang along with me ..... I'm so lovely .... Don't go to the racetrack .......... ..........
=
But as I keep listening, Ryu Sujeong and Kay are really good voices for ballads.
=
This is Lovelyz
=
The ribbon on Kay's blonde looks really good.
=
But this stage was a bright concept, but it was a new attempt that I had never done before .. It's not a sen concept but a concept. It's a bit unfortunate to be able to do anything and always be a protagonist
I was good at both dancing and singing, and this time I'm sure it's a new challenge. Why are you coming back?
Lovelyz is really lovely whatever you do and it was so good. I was so impressed and I can see you on the elite show.
I love singing, dancing, planning and arranging everything. I've always been happy to see everything on stage and care about moving. I've always been so happy with Lovelyz.
=
The best song to express the sad song lyrics .. Girl Group. .
=
I feel so good lol I keep seeing them personally
=
I love you ❣
Thank you for thinking of the opportunity as a queen.
No matter what concept you love, I won't change, so I hope you've done as much as you're not going to regret in the future.
=
This song is really good, especially when we sing together
=
I'm crying. I wasn't a fan because I just couldn't see the lights while I was in Queendom, but I was so sorry but this stage was so good. How did you choose the lyrics?
=
Regardless of the concept, all the music that Lovelyz does is good and always cheering. I love Lovelyz .. There are so many good songs besides Cameo.
=
Everybody have a look at the full version, please check it out .. Why do you have to go to see it yourself?
=
I'm not a fan of Queendom. In fact, most of the girls think it's a crush. I looked at Queen's song and looked for the songs of Lovelyz. I've been stuck with more and more bright songs of the day like you, especially now (sleeping every day ☺️), but that's not all, but it's not all that Lovelyz, which is reflected in the public at Queen's Day. I was sorry. this time
I thought it was a stage that only Lovelyz can do, and I smiled all the time. I hope you don't remember that Lovelyz is good at bright and lovely stages. I think I felt Lovelyz's thirst in the previous contests, but as a result, I hope that I will grow more nourishment with words of criticism rather than criticism. In fact, it's a precious singer who's not good enough to see and listen to good fans.
=
Wow .. I didn't know it was Golden Child Jang Joon at the start.
=
Someone who wrote a cameo lyrics
One to Three For Five Six Seven on Lyrics!
8 members Lovelyz! That's right
=
Baby Soul sings like a good dog
=
I'm pretty elite and come see me ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I feel better when Cody's debut
=
It's the only stage that keeps coming back
=
Cameo stage was the best
=
My wish is that Lovelyz is one of the first in the airwaves ... ㅠㅠ Compared to the quality of the song, so I was sad and sorry, but I wish I could walk the flower road now. I'm so sad that I heard more bitterness in the Queendom that challenged me to show a new face. I'm so sad .... Don't mind it.
=
It's like watching a teen movie ...
=
Now I understand why the name is Lovelyz
=
The stage that goes well together is so good .. The contest is not a fragmentary stage, but a story is made by gathering.
=
This is something like a musical.
=
It's a real legend, just looking at the real heart trembling sisters ... it's a big hit.
=
Oh my girl is the innocence
Lovelyz is so good because it's like pounding like a normal teen or 20
=
Lovelyz Fighting Cheer Title of collecting song
=
I'm sure you've been struggling when you're sixth sensation, but this stage is so hot. You're going to like this rocker who came out on the stage.
=
Nobrain will be watching this
=
This is a concept that only Lovelyz can express. If you look at the stage, it's bright and lovely.
=
I've come to see you again.
=
Whenever I watch the video again, I can see the details that I never saw.
=
I watched this stage and cried as I ran in all directions.
=
If you look at the Queen Cameo and Six Senses Lovelyz cover songs, you know that there is a concept that suits Lovelyz, and that the more you stand out, the better. And when he was on stage, when he was on the stage, he knew how to look and how to make up and how to make up his concept and voice. It would have been awkward as well. When I first encountered Lovelyz at Six Sense, I knew that Jisu Su could just be different from the Lovelyz members and could only have a cool personality and cool concept. I think I know how to do it. Too cool and hard work Don't get hurt, do it nice and pretty
=
04:07 I'm so happy with this ad lip.
=
I love you elite ㅠㅠ So pretty
=
The concept was so good at this time. Soyeon is the song that Lovelyz can do best.
=
The Americas are really fun
=
It looks so good TT TT TT If you do your best in your field
=
1:56 Only me, subtitles, funny? LOL LOL LOL LOL
I was watching, but suddenly the subtitles oh yes ~
=
I keep thinking about this, it's addictive
=
Still popular
=
But Kay is a real celebrity
=
So good
=
I like songs so much
=
Oh, it's really pretty.
=
It's my style too .... ❤️
=
Oh my god
=
I watched this video more than 10 times.
=
I really like Yuji
=
I knew it, lol
=
Lovelyz is really lovely ~ ❤❤
=
This is lovely lol
=
It's refreshing as if it's just debuted .. ❣
=
The Americas
=
I'll only watch it until I get tired. How long will I see this?
=
Keep TAKE ONE in your head! Tictu! I was stuck ...
=
The concept is too tight for you
=
I feel like wearing my clothes now
=
This was my breath.
=
It looks like the color of the real lovelys. I also tried other things but this song shows the color of the real lovelys.
=
In the beginning, there were many Korean comments, but more and more English comments.
=
3:23 Where have you seen a lot?
=
Screaming with hey ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I reused those desks and chairs I used in idol school Mnet ...
=
I can die now
=
Pink shoes + carnival
=
Lovelyz is the best
=
It was a stage where fans felt why Lovelys loved the brightness.
=
I watched the lyrics saying that I wanted to be good at it, and I was crying when I remembered the stages that I had been soured and ridiculed for ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
But surely this concept is a real wicket. My air spouting ㅠ Lovelyz girl and sexy concept also had a lack of curve tack and understanding of the song, but if you hold it properly, you can digest it well. I'm really looking forward to the final stage.
=
Oh, lovelyz, I love you so much
=
No biscuit good looks what's really pretty
=
This is the charm of Lovelyz ㅠㅠ I'm performing this song ㅠㅠ Wow album's favorite song ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Oh, tears and books
=
Oh, and Yu Ji's voice is so pretty. Why did your agency only talk to you? When you come back, sing with your sister's voice.
=
I'm sure they're comfortable with the song, and the concept is so easy.
=
Ryu Soo Jung He felt from the time of the Sixth Sense, but his voice is really similar to Beau Girl Cain. Seemed to be a real voice
=
It's K super cute this time
=
I didn't know it well, but Su Ji-soo is so good at acting.
=
Do you know Kay ... He's a half bundle of ribbon pins that look so good ... I think it looks good when I see a subtype before.
=
Lovelyz did lovelyz ^^
I saw the stage that maximized their strengths. 10 points out of 10
=
It was good to be able to hear Yu Ji-ae's voice personally.
I only knew it with a baby-like voice, but on this stage I felt like I showed my voice.
=
American teen feels musical look
=
The bright mood, sad lyrics, really Lovelyz
=
Lovelyz's unique and unique color was a stage that made me feel better ㅠㅠ Melodies are bright but the lyrics are so sad. I've smiled all the time. Lovelys Finals!
=
I'm a fan of thin stealers
=
Lovelyz Song Special: Singing sad content brightly
=
The last one of my life is going to be ... ㅠㅠ Ryu Sujeong Intro crazy. Really ... The world cameo triangle Daydream Three, listen to, listen to all of the Lovelyz songs, please be deceived and please three first ...
=
No. Lovelyz could try this or that. Well, he keeps coming back. Whether it's rolling back or flying, Lovelyz and everyone else is moving forward.
=
This is what really lovelys do best .. ㅠㅠㅠ I think this concept was really good .. ㅎㅎ
=
There's a song called "Just" in the Lovelyz song, and it's a song that only real steamers listen to.
Please listen to it. Others have recommended a lot of songs included in the comments.
=
The contents of the song are reminiscent of a day that was discovered somehow!
=
I love you love❤❤I'll love you forever
=
I'm a Lovelyz fan and now I'm only seeing you. I'm a lovely Cameo song. I really like Lovelyz. Please give me this one once.
=
This song is a favorite song.
You did the stage.
There are a lot of good songs
Lovelyz, please!
=
I'm going to be a fan of Lovelyz.
=
Honestly, I know I have never staged this stage except for a year or two when I made my debut. Why do people say that Stahl is the one that Lovelyz originally did? Wow, Destiny, Now, we, the bell, You of the day, Find me, Gusau, etc. It's a totally different concept and feeling. I've just digested this stage so well that everyone is lovely
I used it because it seemed to be memorized as Z had been doing this song. Real Destiny and WoW aren't totally such a stale but everyone curiously "Original Lovelyz is back !!!" So I'm not a fan, but I usually listened to Lovelyz music. I can't understand this situation.
=
The first part of the crystal that passes by? At that time, I think I missed the timing ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I've already moved on to the next one, and I'm honoring you to pose next to the camera.
=
This is the only YouTube KOREA video in Queendom.
=
This is Lovers Love song This song seems to be a good match between Huxol and Jisoo
=
It's shining Lovelyz. It's like being in an amusement park.
=
Lovelyz is only forced to be cute. Personally I like the concept of girl crush, but vocals and choreography just to match Lovelyz would be fine.
=
This group can explain why the group name is Lovelyz ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It looks lovely even if you see it
=
The timing of this song is good Fortress drama I think about it one day and the lyrics are pretty but my heart hurts
=
I smile all the time I see you
=
I think of a day I discovered a bit
=
1:18 I've been caught cheating on my secret love affair (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)
=
Everyone, please listen to Lovelyz Queen Final moonlight !! This song shows off the lovely tones.❤❤❤❤
=
Lovelyz debut at the beginning of the canzelup Achu Hello goodbye to you and so many songs I liked so many times to listen back and listen to dozens of times a day I love the feeling of Lovelyz so much ... This time it's really so fast ㅠㅠ It's a stage where every member feels good and looks again. I've heard a song called Cameo.
=
Ah lol I didn't like it very much when I first heard it
=
Isn't Yuji getting old? Still a face
=
This time I love it ㅠㅠ Say that I don't like children last time I've been watching every day This week I'm looking at this video five times every day .. When the pollen bursts, it's so pretty and the lovelyz voice is the prettiest in the world. Awesome .......
=
Personally, it seems to be the longest memory of the third round stage and keep watching it. I'd like you to go find this ... ㅠㅠ Life 띵 song ..
=
I want to be good at one two three four.
=
I was so good ... I would have liked to make the Lovelyz costumes bouncing off like K so that they could be distinguished from back dancers .... ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I really like this stage. My favorite stage .. Real cameo My favorite song is this song that I played in Queendom.
=
I really like it ㅠㅠ I really like it ㅠㅠ
=
K is so cute
=
If you did this once on the stage at the end of the year
=
Musical song is good!
=
Are there any memorable songs in the Pandora's Box other than Lovelyz? It's an eye nose. It's a famous song. Now everybody evaluates only performances, but in the end, it's a song. If the song is good, you will hear it after 10 years and 20 years, and the more you listen to most of the Lovelyz songs, the more full the good songs will be. Besides the title, there are so many famous songs like Cameo.
=
Yeah I wanted this stage
=
This stage is so good, so lovely and cute. And America is so funny.
=
Lovelyz team name is really good.
=
Oh, I'm really impressed with you lol
=
Lovelyz a cappella I want you to do it once
=
I screamed at me
=
Hahahaha
=
2:44 Quotes So lovely to laugh ,,
=
All the accusations I've accumulated so far are falling.
=
Oh, it's really lively and lovely.
=
5 TT TT TT TT TTT
=
3:22 I'm Vincent.
=
It should have been like this ㅠㅠㅠ But ㅠㅠㅠ It's so refreshing that it looks so nice.
=
I've heard a lot of this on the road but I didn't know that Lovelyz sang
=
This is the first time I've enjoyed snow.
=
In the 2nd time, I just played a lot of A-air videos, but this time, I'm only watching Lovelyz.
=
Micah
=
Haha good song
=
Good job
=
Yuji's clothes are pretty.
=
Yes, this is pure innocence of Lovelyz
Bright song with sad lyrics
Lovelyz Now just do one
A cappella
=
This is something only Lovelyz can do
=
Come back ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'm so lovely Lovely
=
I feel good about singing
=
I've been watching this video since Thursday and I GO
=
Cute
=
Americas
=
When we laugh at 2:38, it's our science.
=
I feel like you've disappeared a lot. Always cheer for me.
=
When I look at my sister, I think of her
=
But please hang the lyrics also ....
=
In fact, I ... I wanted to see the mind (handle).
=
Musical meanwhile saw it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!
=
How is Jean doing? 3
=
Lovelyz is always the main character for me.
=
I really didn't understand that this cameo was really good.
=
I think it's the first time a group that matches with the team name and the members ...
=
I'm a fan of Oh My Girl
=
It's called Lovelyz
=
I think it's really ost ㅋㅋ
=
I thought it would be a common stage for the school concept.
=
The legend is ... Ryusujeong ... fall down at the end of the cute ... The book is cute at first ... The acting is also a cute nature ... Existing cute ...
=
Only me ... Is it bad? 3:45 4:59
=
I really loved the Six Senses stage, but I still like this concept
=
Jisoo is so pretty.
=
It's so good because it's a stage where Lovelyz's unique dimness stands out
=
The lyrics are so ㅠㅠ I love Lovelyz I love this stage so much ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
She is pretty and sprouting every half of the class, so she is a student who is popular with everyone. Big-toe is timid but cute and cute.
=
This rat ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=
Sending a movie ending credits Feeling up ??? I feel sad that it's going to break tears ㅠㅠ I feel happy if the movie protagonists were happy ...
I think Lovelyz will be the most memorable for this contest.
=
Queendom is coming out really well.
=
Legend .. It's just Lovelyz .. It wasn't a waste of 3rd place and it was a stage where you could get higher ranks.
=
Looks brighter than Six Sense!
I must be so respectful of all idols!
Cheer up all the idols
=
Who's wearing baseball suit to Ji-soo Su?
=
This song ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Lovelyz is a bright song that looks so good with your voice or facial expressions ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Forget the sixth sense and do this song in the future ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I wish I could see more because of Queendom .. The lyrics are so pretty and I learned because of Cameo Queendom.
=
'I can do well, but I want to do well, I'll only accumulate ng'
=
Lovelyz is also bright but I feel good when I listen to these songs so I feel good and know all the songs ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I came back to see the cameo like this musical
=
Oh it's TT TT This is TT TT But the lyrics are just like Lovelyz My heart hurts TT TT I tried new things because they wanted to be good
=
The reason why this stage is so important to fans is the 8-person cameo,
I didn't expect to see 8 cameos on the air.
=
I want to increase the number of surges and increase the one shot.
=
Lovelyz believes that she will grow properly through real queendom, and she has earned a good reputation and will continue to grow.
What's more, it's growing. Lovelyz is going to be a long run ❣❣
=
Wow ... it's not really good and it's not a normal stage but it looks like a musical and everything looks good with clothes .. ㅠㅠㅜ What should I say?
=
Somebody take this song out of my head,
=
Wouldn't I be amoeba if you cameo?
=
The title was cameo but it was like the main character in this song
=
The lyrics are a bit like a day
=
I personally like it so much that I think it shows what Lovelyz can do with it. I haven't escaped the pretty chuck that I wanted so much, but it's a stage that shows pretty well what Lovelyz has. It was the prettiest and most suitable song of the Lovelyz stage in Queendom and it was a concept on the stage.
=
Jonah is a pretty girl ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I don't know how many times I see you
So good
=
2:43 Jisoo is cute
=
Lovelyz is really
The lyrical lyrics + the bright song goes so well This song and Lovelyze go so well together
=
1:03 LOL
=
Oh, this song is my taste.
I'm a fan of other groups, but it's okay to have a good time even if this stage was first place ...
=
This is Lovelyz ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ❤
=
I'm really good at it. Whenever I see you, it's the best.
=
Lovelyz that you want to do is also in Lovelyz.
=
Among the songs included in Lovelyz,
I really know what I know
=
3:54 Thanks to the shouts, people laughed, shouted and enjoyed everything, but don't walk down.
=
Oh my tears TT TT TT TT My children are finally hurting ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I really struggled a lot ❤
To Lovelinus you're always number one. I love you ❣❣
=
HOLLY LOVELY Please come back with this concept ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Kichikichi Teen Musical Concept ㅠㅠㅠ Let's ring please ~~ !!!! ㅠㅠㅜㅜ
=
The Americas, what are you doing? Soul is piled up
Hey!
Scream out ↗️
Ando
=
Please listen to the triangle once.
=
Imju ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The Americas are so cute and will die
=
ㅠㅠ Really good job this time ㅠㅠ Too much work Lovers ㅠㅠ
=
This song was the most frequently listened song among the Lovelyz songs, but it's better to arrange the music more cheerfully and stage it. It's so pretty.
=
Cute ♡
=
This stage is too good but I want you to do a lot of concepts that I want to be lovely.
=
This is really lovely.
=
My standard Queendom stage TOP3 ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It looks so good.
=
The song is so good ???? It wasn't the title
=
This was one of the best things Lovelyz showed on Queen's stage.
=
I really like cameo in this album and I still listen to it.
=
I really wanted to sing this song.
Cameo
=
I'm sad
=
Yeah, Lovelyz goes well with this concept!
=
The song is repeating infinitely.
=
I'm listening to the Queen's Lovelyz and I'm listening to a lot of songs Cameo is one of my favorite songs, but I'm glad to see you on stage ^^ * I'll support you in various ways.
=
It's a stage where hard work takes place, a stage where you can enjoy yourself, so it's comfortable and exciting to see, thank you so much for showing such a stage.
=
I was so sad every time I listen to these songs.
=
Do whatever you want to do
=
I feel like watching a high school musical
=
Popular video Congratulations Lovelyz !!
=
Kim Ji Yeon Chegoda
=
Lovelyz is the best when it's a lovely concept ...
=
It sounds like you're watching a short play
=
Miju Mi sister
=
This is it !! Everyone is watching
=
Myungeun tt ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ I think that today everyone is pretty and good ㅠ ㅠ styling was so good ㅠ ㅠ
=
Yes, Lovelyz is this. Lovely as a group name
=
Honestly, Lovelyz wasn't so good, but there are many hidden songs, members are pretty, and I changed my mind about Lovelyz .. I'm sorry.
=
No humane modifications are so pretty.
=
This time I think it's the song that's right for them.
=
Wow, I know the name of the elite, but I'm so pretty.
=
Replying to @AustraliaChocolate
=
Stage where Lovelyz 'strengths are revealed
=
Tears as a lovely fans This song is a real song but it just hurts because it was buried.
=
Please listen to Lovelyz Moonlight on the music site ♥
=
Good job ... ♥
=
Your face is so good, it's a real genius
=
Ryu Sujeong is really crazy ... apple itself ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Oh, I'm so pretty, tears and Johnnie's big and lovely, up to the top of my mouth, like a real teen girl I love you sisters
=
I'm so cute I'm so cute I'm going to be so cute
=
2:44 Sergeant's laughing crazy?
=
Yeah, it's just that you can do it. Lovelyz is this concept.
=
It's so lovely even if a woman sees it
=
I really did it so well.
=
Whamchin cameo is a favorite song ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Everyone is really pretty and the stage is definitely very good and powerful school ..? I really like this concept
=
I started with 6th place and it was difficult to controversial paup, but I love you so much for making such a wonderful stage.
=
3:22 I really enjoyed watching the fans and following them.
=
Do you know that when you are one-to-three, kids will bounce in plump order in their ages? ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
3:44 Shooting Jill Oh my god lol lol lol
=
Something musical
=
벱 Sol's glasses are crooked and cute.
=
Good song.>
=
1:19 2:56 Bagging
=
It's not a cameo, it's movie heroines.
=
The most beautiful biscuits ..
=
Okay I'm so kind and the gap difference ㅠㅠㅠ Oio I clothes are so pretty even though I'm not a big fan of it ㅠㅠㅠ
=
This is the opening comment of Lee Jang-joon.
=
I think the Lord looks like a tower among the idols It's so pretty
=
It's like a teen movie with a real high school background.
=
It was good to be in third place, literally Pandora's box
Regardless of the stage rankings that make the fans feel good, I was so thankful for showing the 8-player cameo and I think it was the best team for the theme.
This is the 1st and 2nd criticism is a part of the ringing big picture made to sing. I think it fit so well with the cameo lyrics
=
Everyone, please watch the celebrity direct cam video lol
=
Lovelyz has always tried various things. Even if the title song has a variety of colors, and the feeling of the recorded song is different. It is a group that can encompass various atmospheres. People who are not interested in Lovelyz compel you to be pure.
=
It makes no sense that this is the sixth place vote.
=
The stage that I turned back after the kids again and again, why are you so good?
=
04:07 Celebrity part ㅔ
=
It's too bad to be ridiculed by Six Senses stage yet. I love this stage ☺️☺️
=
Jimin Mind = My Mind
It was a pity to find the wrong concept, but I feel good because it is the fifth place in real time.
=
What did Oh My Girl mention in this video? Are you an ompan or a muggle? Oh, don't mention it here
=
If it was a triangle, it would have been more amazing ...
I hope to have a Pandora mission later.
=
Six Sense and Achu weren't because of Lovelyz's ability, but they didn't fit the tone and image of the tone.
=
4:00 Why are you crying from here, this is the ability to do only Lovelyz, I've been struggling and so pretty :) Thank you so much for being so lovely and trying so hard Lovelyz was the best
=
Coming back here knowing Jangjun is the voice actor from the start. Wth why its so funny for me ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
When other singers light it up for a while, everyone seems to be friendly.
=
I'm so good, how are you?
=
TT TT TT TT TOO TOO TT TTT TWO TT
=
2:36 Oh Io
=
Oh really, I'm crying on stage ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㄹㅇ
=
First chorus 1:15 K is so pretty at this time.
=
Oh, the stage is so good and the song is so good
=
Scream! Oh, it's cute and funny
=
Isn't this the lyrics too much ??? ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Please collect the songs really
=
Oh my sister is so innocent and shouts !!! No way! Isn't this too funny? Other members are fluttering and sad.
=
The dance is so lovely ~~~~~~~
=
No it's okay
=
The song is really new !!!!!!!!!!
Lovelyz celebrates 3rd place !!!!!!!!!!!!
=
Lovelyz what is realtime? ㅠㅠㅠ ?? It's so good
=
I love it so much
=
This was really good
=
Lovelyz is so cute
=
Ah lol
=
Lovelyz looks really good on this concept
=
America's tension is the best
=
This is addictive coming
=
The Americas were scared
=
It was like seeing Lara Land when Ryu Soojung started. Kay is a doll.
=
I've heard this song for the first time.
=
1:04
Jimin reaction
I'm back ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Americas lol
=
It was refreshing and good ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I was worried about the previous stages
Last fun and really good song
=
Americas ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Sad lyrics to real bright melody Lovelyz unique song sentimental so good❤❤❤❤❤
=
I love you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Thank you for making me proud to be a Lovelyz fan
=
In this concept, it seems to be the best ~~ Really. Lovely Lovelyz ~~
=
The clean concept is the best
=
I'm Segel Ye.
=
Even if I use it as a little ost
=
I'm better than the stages, but it's better to wear a skirt and a chair.
=
It's annoying
=
Only me tear me ..?
=
Shout at me !!!!!!!!
=
I love you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I love you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
There is one day in the mbc drama, but if you come to see it all, it will be very high.
=
5:02 Americas Adliv ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Song is so good
=
This version seems to be fine in performance, but it is much better to listen to the sound source ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Sad lyrics and youthful voice I really like ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Oh, so good ... It was a stage where I could compete with my standard children.
=
I'm still here to see the 4:07 part ... ㅠ ^ ㅠ
=
Did you choose the concept? Then I'm a genius. I'm a cute dog.
=
As a really lovely fan
I've done so well, everyone, I keep thinking about it and seeing the audience like it.
3:07 Does that make sense?
You're number one for me
=
Baby Soul's tone is so good. I've been back many times
=
I want this to be lovely
=
It's so nice to see it because it's a stage that they're good at.
=
It's like a real musical scene. It's so nice and cute, it's so lovely and lovely.
=
At Queen's Day, Lovelyz was the one who made the best of the concept and stage that they wanted to do, and it was strange that people ridiculed it strangely. The only thing I love is the Lovelyz stage
=
Luluz's distinctive bright and sad? Are you tired? It's like a good expression ... There's a musical like that.
=
Still second place.
=
No, Baby Baby Soul is so cute.
=
1:47 Tvivo is like me in every corner of the solar house.
=
Please listen to the lovely triangle
The song is really good !!
=
He was just a joke. He just rocked the stage. Hey, cameo is a song, but there are more songs!
=
I've been looking for a direct cam first, but I can see the chore cam more clearly. It was a stage that only Lovelyz can do
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I thought it was vocal over the last six senses. It's hard to digest a Six Sense song .. I used to swear a lot last time. I'm in favor of another concept. If you digest well in many ways, you will be able to show Lovelyz like this stage.
=
This is good, but I loved Lovelyz trying to make various attempts at Queendom. Keihwasa duet and the gentleman Mr. Jinja were also good, but I hope Lovelyz doesn't just remember the innocence. By the way, I can see myself from 3:16 and Kay from 4:06.
=
Why did I see JYP in 1:57?
=
Why doesn't YouTube put Korean on top?
There are many Korean comments made in Korea
Do you ignore Hangul?
=
The lyrics to “I can do well but I want to do well” weren't the time for Lovelyz Six Sense. I'm not a lovely fan or other idol fan. Everyone feels sick I think it's good news that they're coming out of Queendom, but I hope this program won't underestimate Lovelyz's skills. I think this is a stage that only Lovelyz can do
=
Seo Ji-soo is so pretty.
=
The day I discovered by chance seems like Dano. I want to be the main character ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
What should I say ... I should say that Idol of my imagination ... Really lovely and feeling alone to see !!! The melody is bright and lovely, but the lyrics are sad and sad.
=
How upset is this by watching this comment?
=
It's also a real talent to show off such lovely things. I'm not getting away from 1:14 in the chorus.
=
What's the elite ㅠㅠ Prettiest look ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's a color that only lovelys can do
=
Lovelyz fans would have liked to see this stage so much that they cried,
=
Last ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=
Remind me one day is not a joke to enter the mall ;;; I like the song
=
The last one
=
Scream ~~~ lol
=
The song is really good
=
1:17 What are you talking about? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The lyrics are so pretty
=
This is what they are good at. I want to know that now. I sweared a lot in this pro ... It's because I'm trying to push out what I'm not good at. I hope to keep working hard
=
I hope it was a chance to find their color.
=
It was a stage where smiles were made all the time.
thank you
=
I don't know how many times I watch this video.
=
It's really like this ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I'd like to sing it at the karaoke room because I like it the most among the lovelyz songs.
The song I saw when Yein sang on the air
I love the concept so much.
I'm so happy that cameo people know this time.
I love triangle too, but cameo was so good that cameo alone ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
(Who knows as a steamed Lovelyners kitchen?)
=
I'm so cute
=
Personally, I think it's really cool when I start to refrain from verse 2. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Oh, I'm so cute 닼 ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'm going to buy you by screaming in my life. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I was so tired of practicing Jisoo's sister.
=
It's much better to wear the right clothes ...
=
It's like a high school musical and it's so pretty.
=
04:40 I only like this part from the ending? It's so good that the song ends like a real musical.
=
You must have been distracted by the rankings, but I did well this time.
=
I'm not a fan of Lovelyz, but I've heard a lot of songs from the album so far. I've been trying to show the different appearances that I can't show as a comeback activity. It would have been hard, but it was great to show them that their music was not in vain and a good talent singer.
=
It's not a fan but it was really cute and a great stage. Lovelyz ㅎㅎ Thinking of the past and going on in the future !!
=
This stage is so good I feel like I'm full of cuteness
=
If the cameo is a triangle or 1cm, it would be azo harpoon
=
I think it's really good to match the character of Lovelyz members.
Samsol- Student chairman wearing glasses and school uniform wearing backpack
You're a cute school senior wearing only a stupid cardigan
Seo Ji-soo-A baseball pitcher who greets you every time you practice in the morning
Lee Mi-ju-I'm a school uniform.
K- Unconditional Great King Ribbon Cheerleading Club Manager
JIN- He was caught by Kay and entered the cheerleading club.
Ryu Soo-jung-Head leader wearing a school uniform wearing a headband
Elite- I'm very interested in fashion.
=
This is a bright song, but it's sad to see the lyrics.
=
A song that reminds me of one day
=
American hahahaha
=
It's really pretty to smile
=
Smiling girl in the middle
=
This is Lovelyz stage ㅠㅠ Really know that you're good as a fan I was so sorry, but it was really good Lovely potting!
=
Lovelyz looks really unique in this concept.
Lovelyz is the only thing that expresses these lyrics.
=
I saw my mom smiled.
Clown hurts
=
Elite dog
=
I feel like watching a teen movie ...
=
Yes, this is the only one I listen to.
=
Lovelyz Cameo Singing
=
It's so nice to see you again
=
Her lovelyz school uniform skirt is familiar, but it's like a junior high school skirt that I graduated from.
=
Please listen to the triangular triangles of me ... Cameo and triangular cuddle.
=
Ryu Soo Jung is so pretty
=
How many times are you watching this?
=
I'm here again.
=
I saw a lot. It's a pity that the concept is right for you.
However, it still seems difficult to contain sexy girls. Can't we study the concept and try something more? I've heard Lovelyz songs often, but I first learned about them. The sad lyrics and the bright stage are completely different and I feel sad because it is the biggest advantage of the Lovelyz stage. Thank you:)
=
What is this?
=
Look like a musical
=
Why don't you talk about Jisoo? ㅠㅠ 7 days romance and my sister is so good.
I am so pretty.
=
Are you out of the America's unrequited love contest?
=
It's charisma to do this well.
=
It's like a high-tension student
=
Queendom I don't know when it will end, but if you get a chance, please do it with the bell now .......
=
Lovelyz is unique to the concept that makes us feel excited and first love.
I want you to save them a little more
=
AOA senior is her
=
A teen film was filmed and memorized. I remember that my sisters crushed me when I was in school
=
When I look at the lyrics, I remember the day I discovered. ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The Americas are screaming amazing! I get the camera right away
=
This stage is the best in the real world ... I'm coming to see you all the time Is there no song like this? ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's the best really ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
These cute and cute children are of course Lovelyz, and it's also lovely to see people happy. Thanks to Deokhu, the concept doesn't matter.
=
Thanks to its talents, I've now been nominated for the 2019 Idol Brand Grand Prize, and from mid-November, KBS2 will be fixed at 11 pm on Friday night at Jang Sung-gyu's new show.
Mother of America also commented last time ㅠ Mother of America has a bad comment 'America is pretty' Article Comments that America sees no matter how much I look like a mother ID shed tears at the hostel TT Idol is a person It's the same person who can change college majors, challenge and fail.
It's the same person who works hard until he becomes a protagonist.
=
The strongest part of Lovelyz
1. youthfulness and innocence 2. lyrical emotions
These two things. Surprisingly (somewhat named) groups are not as strong as this group
Not only do these two concepts, but when you try a new concept, I want you to consider whether you want to harmonize with them.
For example, if you go to the sexy concept, you can feel seductive while maintaining a lyrical feeling.
If you want to do a girl crush, you can put your dance brakes in the middle with the concept of a tough cheerleader's daughter.
The first two stages just abandoned those merits,
This stage makes good use of those two things. And the new song moonlight makes a lyrical feeling while trying new things.
I could change those two concepts while applying them, but it was a shame as a fan. I hope you don't tie yourself to the ridicule that you mocked in the last contest, but keep trying to keep your strengths.
=
I'm a passing fan of Oh My Girl .. there are still some lovely people coming down; I think it was good to see this stage, why ?; Are you not interested in the contest and just don't like the group "Lovelyz"?
=
The song was so good that the part distribution was especially good.
Lovelyz is so showy! (America-chan ...)
=
4:05 Here's a little bit different nano time.
=
Ryu Soo-jeong What's the first bar bully really cute ... I'll die ... 1:03 Jimin's heart ... Cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute, cute.
=
I personally liked this stage first
=
It's so good, but looking at the full cam version makes it fun to find every detail.
=
No need to say anything else, Lee Soo-jeong, Yu Ji-ae, Su Ji-soo, Lee Mi-ju, Kim Ji-yeon, Park Myung-eun, Ryu Soo-jeong and Jeong In-in are the best.
=
I've done well this time because I'm good at it
=
The song is so good
=
You of that day, please visit, we loved those days, etc. If you listen to a few recent songs, you won't be able to conclude Lovelyz with the limits of 'innocent youthfulness'.
=
04:06 Man Holly is the scene ...
=
3:48 Are you surprised? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
AO likes more than Lovelyz fans ㅠㅠ Especially our tree sister ㅠㅠ Too pretty Pretty social ㅠㅠ
=
Now I see a group called Lovelyz
=
I don't know anything else 3:07 I've repeated infinitely here ... and personally visually
=
Lovelyz looks like this song is really good
=
This time, I chose the song very well. The lyrics that are unique to the real Lovelyz, but sing along to the second part of the song, become more emotionally late.
=
The song is really good and the musical concept goes so well together I love Lovelyz ❤❤❤
=
Good job Lovelyz :)
=
Quite a few people in the sense of seeing the concept suits me well because of my people also seems ^^ comfortable and enjoyable to wear suits as you go geomyeon unique atmosphere kwindeom Achutupo to Mr Ryan, as a youth, Mr. Hart or The Red Shoes, Girls IU to I think it's okay to change it a little. I feel like I'm getting mature and sexy.
=
Lovelyz is the best concept like this
=
I think about it .. Extra sadness lol
=
I'm really waiting ㅠㅠ Lovelyz's unique color ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm so happy to see you ~ By the way, this song is not Qual.
=
I really liked this song
=
I love giving letters (?)
=
Lovelyze Fighting
=
Yes this is it
=
Fastest Rising Videos # 3
=
There's a lot of lovely songs
=
I thought there was a strange face after watching the video.
7 Days of Romance on Web Drama
Lovelyz was a bibliography
=
I always listened to the cameo
=
The song is good too lovely
=
America ~~~~
=
Lovelyz This concept fits really well every time you hear Lovelyz sing like this
=
TT
=
I keep coming back ...
=
Finally, Lovelyzgi seems to be wearing pretty clothes for them.
=
Everyone in the group said that they were pretty dead.
=
ㅠ ㅜ ㅜ I'm really the best I'm so lovely and I've been feeling good all over the time.
=
This is ... This is ... Please ... Please ring
=
Lovelyz was really good at this time. ㅠㅠ Originally, I was a fan of Oh My Girl. .
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This is other people's Lovelyz ~! It's funny doing it
Honestly, this is the best part of Lovelyz Queendom
Not really good but really good
=
3rd place in all day popular video
=
I'm always good at this time, what are you screaming again ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅠㅠ
=
I can do it well, but I want to do it well ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Ul Lovelyz Sisters I'd believe that it's been trying to lay a narrative for this stage. genre...
=
Nick was lovely
=
I remember the day I discovered
This stage is dim and overpowered.
Lovelyz's unique refreshing .. ㅠㅠ
=
Look at other starring smiles ㅠㅠ I feel really looking at you ❤❤
I think it's a high school musical. Lovelyz people try a lot of trials and errors and get over it and it's a good thing they're good at it :)
=
It's so cute. Lovelyz seems to have really paid off.
=
As soon as you find the Lovelyz atmosphere,
It's so cute and pretty and this is it !!!!!
=
This cameo song is so good but this stage is so good
=
I wasn't interested in Lovelyz, but this time I came to find a song from the Queendom, and I learned a lot of masterpieces. I also knew something that I wanted to show in the previous contests, so I felt sorry to hear this cameo lyrics. Lovelyz's stage was so good. The musical sounded better and the members went well as intended as it was musical. And it's so cute ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'll keep listening to the song with Lovelyz in the future. Lovely Fighting!
=
It would have been really ugly because of the sixth sense, but this time it seems like a pretty good one.
=
It was a pity that I ate too much at Six Sense, but it was a stage I watched so well because I felt like I found Lovelyz's identity without being bad.
=
I've never really done it ... I'm really good at it.
=
When I sing together, the voice is so pretty and distinctive
=
So cute and lovely! It was a stage I really enjoyed! Lovelyz's charming feeling! And the chords that the biggest strength of Lovelyz was talking about .. I know right away. The chords are so pretty.
=
Lovelyz I've got all the songs
I've been cheering since my debut day.
The stats are so full !!! Cameo triangle heart Sweet and sour fondant etc. Lovelyz's heartbreaking unrequited love lyrics
It's really good to make it so much that I hope many people will know it and I'm glad that many people know as much as this stage is in real time. It's 5 years now, but let's always be together !!
And this concept is the best! If you want other concepts like Lovelyz and you want to show them, I hope you show them a lot !!!!
=
I love you, Sujeong, Jung-ah .. It's good that I really imprinted your existence.
=
I was looking forward to the image of Lovelyz I really expected. ♥
=
Stage that unveiled teen drama through musical
I feel like seeing.
=
Rat
=
I don't know what the original song looks like but I think it's good to arrange it with a carol feeling.
I did a little bit about Lovelyz with Six Sense, but after this stage, I found Six Sense to be too difficult and fit into the concept.
=
Baby Soul decorate me pretty, no matter how miserable it is ;;;
=
Lovelyz's concept is so full and digestible that it's just a common girl group stage.
=
Oh, are you sad?
=
This is Lovelyz
=
I'm crying, but I feel good when I see this stage
=
It's an all-time stage. The song is crazy. The children are so innocent. I want to raise my daughter like you.
=
I'm so pretty.
=
I'm in love with the introduction.
=
I didn't know it was recorded by a junior Golden Child member of the same company as the opening announcement Lovelyz lol
=
I keep thinking about it. I didn't know the cameo.
=
There's a lot of good songs out there, and all the title songs are the best .. Thank you for making a really good stage this time. I'll always cheer for you.
=
Ost class
=
A cameo with a tow ... It's not a concert. It's even a broadcast ... Keep it going.
=
Really, this concept can only handle Lovelyz
=
When I first heard it, I felt like watching a teen musical movie. It was so good.
=
Ryu Soo-jeong ... Your name ... From today ... I won't forget .......
=
This performance is so cool If you forget all the bad comments ...
=
I'm on the top ranking ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Let's have a cameo rice cake !!!
=
Bibliography Jerkke Is it pretty cute?
Until yesterday, I was like a subconscious
3:07 4:15
=
So this is Lovelyz;
It was like watching a US youth musical number and the stage was so good.
=
Yeah, this is Lovelyz's the best suited to your clothes
=
Lovelyz is really good ...
=
2:42 No, she's like you're laughing at her apartment.
=
This is Lovelyz! After all, Lovelyz! After all too!
=
I didn't know Lovelyz but there are so many good songs ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ❤️❤️
=
I'm really fond of cameo songs ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's better to see it on stage ....... ㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ
=
It's so good, I'm crazy ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ I think I'm just watching it I love you
=
How happy are you to see?
=
I really liked it when I made my debut. I loved it so much.
=
Yeah, Lovelyz is this
Flutter and innocence
Seeing naturally reacts and laughs
=
The Americas Why is it so high? Why is it high tension? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Lovelyz
=
The genre is Lovelyz ... Also this is Lovelyz
=
4: 05-4: 10 Yes, I'm really upset about how many times
=
Delayed crying sister ..... ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
This mouse ~~~ This is Lovelyz.
=
Equal
=
It's lovely, it's cute
=
1:30 seconds, I'm so excited ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Honestly, I was so embarrassed in the previous contest, but I'm so excited about this stage. I was so good at the stage that each one of the lovelyz members could see it well. Thank you very much for the last time I was really stressed out because of the public reaction. I really did well. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I just want to be praised.
=
You have to wear your own clothes to have synergy.
=
This is ... This is really good
=
Oh my god
=
Lovelyz Cameo
=
ㅠㅠ I'm not the only good thing .. Fortunately ..
=
Lovelyz would like to sing many youthful songs
=
Lovelyz
=
I love Lovelyz
=
Lovelyz's cute Jimin is really cute
=
This is Lovelyz .. ♡♡
=
It's fresh but it's dim, black
=
This is so pretty
=
Oh this
=
Isn't it ringing !!
=
This is Lovelyz
=
This is a girl group
=
We've been teased so far to show this. It's really gorgeous. It's my taste. I'm so pretty. I'm so cute.
=
I want to listen to Kim Ji-yeon's voice for a whole day. I can't run out of honey.
=
Oh, this is a good song
TT rediscovery of the songs
=
What's so good? I have to study, but I keep seeing it.
=
Already 줔 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I think it's attractive
=
Wow, cameo I didn't know how to watch it in Queendom. Lol It's the most loved song. But I think the original song is better.
=
Do it like this from the beginning.
Braids ㅋㅋ
=
Including Mnet crew, one or two stages of intellectual rumors will be shut down. Why are you admonishing the limits of others at will.
=
It's the best in the real stage !!!! Very good ㅠㅠ
=
5:00 Ahhhhh
=
3:22 I only think of JYP.
=
What's so pretty about you?
=
Sisters aren't supposed to be cameos. Sisters have been in my mind for a long time. What are you talking about? Please look at this once. I'm so grateful for my sister's response. I'm laughing all the time. My mouth hurts because I laugh. I have to go to the hospital.
=
No no no no no no no no no no no
=
This is Lovelyz
=
This concept suits you best.
=
Go up to the chair and put on a long skirt and shorts inside.
=
Lovelyz live video is # 2?
Lovelyz Please do your best in the future ~~ ㅠㅠ
=
#Lovelys
# 1 for us is Lovelyz
=
Teen Musical On the other hand, it seems .. Stage background Costume Directing Choreography Everything is perfect Let's just go like this Lovelyz !! And I'm pretty pretty too.
=
Happiness
=
I don't know how many times I'm looking back I'm really really good
=
0:27 She's cute selling her nose
=
My thoughts = 1:04
=
Everyone looks cute and looks like a student ♡ Baby Soul wears glasses so I can see the sadness
=
It would have been better if I had a stage that was perfect for Lovelyz earlier ㅠㅠㅠ It was better than this stage ㅠㅠ other girls' reactions are completely different
=
Isn't that a desk chair? I'm good at recycling Mnet. I used to erase the number of PewD's quick chairs at the awards ceremony, and it's got a whole lot of power because I have a lot of baby soul parts.
=
The song that K seemed to be so relaxed was the first time the chorus was like a cabaret .. Jean Huxol Part, please stretch it like this. ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Honestly, if Lovelyz didn't make a debut early on, everyone is now an adult and looks mature, so it's time to move on to a more serious concept.
It's not like a powerful, cool or sexy concept, but calm maturity seems to be the best for Lovelyz.
=
Lovelyz fans may agree, but it seems that the charm of vocals is revived by storing K. Until then, K's voice felt like the whole song of Lovelyz, but I found that there were many unique and attractive members of the tone.
=
I really expected this song ... I don't think the sound was really important to me ... When I heard the music, I expected more choreographed choreography. Instead, one song is really good.
=
It was clear that Lovelyz was a group that could do this. Achu and Six Sense were trial and error brought about by impatience.
=
Ryu Soo-jung is a jewel.
=
Listen to the ringing. Just one more time. If you talk about your baby's voice, you'll be cursed.
=
Crystal voice looks good.
A little bass and idol-specific
I don't feel like it and I like the ballad well
If you give the crystal to the new song in the future, you will succeed even if you change the concept to mature!
=
I love this song because it's a jello and honestly it's too unfair to do this song once, how can I do it? I'd love to see you at this song stage and at the end of the year!
=
Baby Soul's voice, refreshing feeling. No crazy.
=
Afflictions that told Lovelyz to be cute only ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Reflect on this stage. Really, the new concept is so good, but I think I've set a new direction.
=
The feeling is really different depending on the mebo. Kay feels crying and Chicksol feels feverish and this bad feeling. Jin feels like she's laughing. It's really creepy
=
Soul voice is so pretty Everyone buys more songs because the tone is pretty
=
I can't wait for it to be stored all the time.
=
It's like a stage costume, a true song, and a choreographer ... It's like a musical returning to a place where a young goddess who has fallen from a paradise should be at the end of a difficult journey.
=
It's about Lovelyz Moon
=
This is clothes and choreography. Crazy Artemis dancers ... I told them that Artemis dancers who knew that they weren't bound to love were killed and followed their beliefs. The choreography really turns away when the moon turns red
=
Ah the real name is the treasure of this tone .. Singing, good, dreamy and warm.
=
There is no concept limited to Lovelyz. At the beginning of the debut, Achucan Grub was a good match, but as the members matured, it seems like this song goes well together. I look forward to another look at the next comeback. I think this is pretty fighting!
=
Now I know if Ryu's vocals are strong. Why did you do that?
=
I'm a fan of kids and I just listened to the children's songs and didn't listen to them. I listened to this once and kept listening back.
=
It looks like a real Greek god .. Each one is so good and the members are so well together.
=
When Lovelyz said that he did well, no one praises him. It seems to show people's bad psychology.
=
It's a song that keeps its unique feelings of innocence and sticks to its innocent youthfulness.
=
Crystal seems to be a genius in the introduction.
Like any song, it starts off deliciously
=
Park Myung is a single shot. It's been a long time. Ms. Myung was a single shot. Thank you for changing her to a real shot.
=
Jin and Crystal are the best.
=
목소리 sol voice ㄹㅇ Want to start ?? I don't know at all because there are few parts. 1:29 3:03 3:24
=
Destiny told me that I couldn't leave love like the moon around the earth, but Moonlight told me I'd go out of love and find myself.
=
If Cameo's existing Lovelyz transformed the image into this song, some people know how to write powerful trebles than before. Lovelyz sweared a lot through the Queendom, but it's good to have his own strength and broaden his spectrum.
=
Change the color of the back dancers. The design is similar, but the colors are the same.
=
If you go from Xavier to Kin, Soul, or Crystal, the atmosphere changes. Kay's voice is refreshing, but his song image is too similar. This time, K was also solo, so the atmosphere would change a lot even if he changed the vocal part to vocal and soul.
=
Lovelyz is number one for me.
=
The team that had many twists and turns in Queendom ... ㅠㅠ I think that the challenge and passion are still behind at all. I believe that I can show more stages with these concepts or more challenging and new concepts here. Personally, this stage is so good
=
The song keeps unconsciously singing ... The song is so good.
=
This is a cameo as well, and I'm really good at it.
=
Please activity with this .. so good ...
Mnet kills the audio and puts the balcar ...
To get the right audio and camera
I hope you made a big comeback show
It's too wasteful to see this
=
Fans are happy as if Lovelyz plays on any stage, so I want you to do everything you want to do. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Temple-like songs are really good too. Don't lose your Lives' reputation !!!!
=
Ryu Soo-jung is good, but if you hear the sound of the machine in the chorus ...
=
Fix this tone is real steamed.
That's my first time with such husky pretty voices.
=
Listen to another Queendom song for an hour and another hour for Moonlight. Hear another Queendom song and come to Moonlight. Why is this song so good? Awesome
=
Lovelyz's dreamlike dim atmosphere can't be followed by any group.
=
I keep hearing. It's a tone and harmony doesn't make sense. The dance line really goes well with the song.
=
The song is really good. If you look only at the songs, it feels like first class.
=
Guys, is Lovelyz Artemis right? Lovelyz Artemis Fairies are reincarnate because they're reincarnated Every day of the full moon Pretend to be crazy playing this song or dancing
=
Moonlight also went up to the middle of the Bucks and rose to the top 30 of the melon dance day.Jinney first came in 17th place, and Mnet released it on Friday and then slipped out the next day. Stir it !!!
=
The singers who came out through this Queendom found out that they are more talented and cool than we know. ㅠㅠ I'm sorry that Queendom itself wasn't intended, but it's a good opportunity for six singers. Hopefully
I have no choice but to cheer
=
I wish I could continue with this concept
=
Jin and towed voice are harder and better than ever thought!
Did something? Feeling sorrowful.
=
Ryu Soo-jeong Concept I think it's really high.
=
What is Ryu's face?
No matter what color your hair is or whether you have bangs or a haircut, it's all pretty.
=
Do you feel like an ancient goddess? I don't know what I'm talking about.
=
Jin and Baby Soul hold the highlight well stably, and Yuji is digesting well without a baby's voice.
=
Surely Crystal and Jisoo are expressive ... Other members are really good, but they are more immersed because of their facial expressions.
=
Mr. Wye is really crazy.
=
It's like the gods of the red moon ... I can accept it even though Lovelyz dominates the world.
=
Ryu Soojung seems to digest all the concepts well
=
Lovelyz's unique vagina horror feels good
Ryu Soo-jeong Intro Crazy, and the song is better because the hype is so strong and treble .... Lovelyz wanted this concept Lovelyz Let's just walk the flower path
=
Park Myung has a lot of parts, so tears ㅠㅠ I'm sick of seeing only one or two measures every time I saw me finally TT TT I'd like to give this song to my euneun
=
The song is really good. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ This song, Jung Myung, is like Shin Han-soo.
=
It's a new attempt in the first and second rounds, but I felt like I was trying to talk about something that wasn't too good for Lovelyz, so I felt like I was wearing the wrong clothes, and it was a shame that I missed the new possibility of Lovelyz, which showed me the purity in the final contest. I can feel it.
In fact, the songs that I sang were pure innocent because they were all innocent, but I felt a little pushed in survival by Oh My Girl, who had a sweet dreamy feeling. Can
=
I use Jin and Samso vocals, so I'm really good at singing. I think it's a concept and a vocalist.
=
Feeling that evolved from girl feeling to mature woman feeling
In the meantime, if K had a big portion of main vocals,
This song was a great part of Jin and Soul's main vocals and their ability was so good.
=
It's so good to sing in your own voice, not your baby's voice
=
Wth with 1k haters they r really looking pathetic ..
LOVELYZ really well done
Lovelyz members were really good
=
Really my best sound source ... Are you all artemis or fairies or artemis priests?
=
Lovelyz didn't win even though he was on the legend stage: In the beginning of a dazzling moonlit night, the audience was stunned by a heart attack ...
=
Baby Soul
=
When crystal comes out first, it feels like a real mature red hat and it hit me alone ... Crystal is a treasure and must be recorded and displayed in the ringing office building.
=
This feeling is so good!?! ??????? The soft and strong feeling is so good ....
=
This stage is really good ㅠㅠ best of both Jin and Crystal's voice.
=
I was ridiculed every sixth sense, but in the end, it was a performance that was full of concepts! I prepared hard for the stage
Tina was cool! Sing too well
=
Personally, because K's voice is unique, I was upset because K-Yang calls out to other members, and this time Ryu Soo-jung is chorusing, so it's good to hold it in the middle, build up the jeans, and listen to the rest of the members' voices.
=
It's nice .. It feels a bit creepy and it's like being conscious of the moon.
=
Slightly under the moonlight on a full moon night? Raising like a woman !!!!
=
I rather noticed that when the Queen's was criticized too much for Queens
So I've been hoping for more pops from cameo, and the song is also called `` Olim's '' and it's a good idea, so I hope you'll challenge me a lot in the future.I'm done.I love you, Jung-ah.
=
It's going to be very hard to find eight different tone groups.
=
Jin's voice is so good.
=
This is one of the best stages of Lovelyz's performance in Queendom so far. It's a dreamy and cool feeling. It's a lot of maturity, so this concept fits better. Everybody has a good tone, a good vocal, and the song is addictive.
=
When we look at the part distribution every time
My heart hurts but crystal
I love it this time
This is over 100 times ㅠㅠ
Let's go to this concept next time!
=
I'm crazy, I'm looking at it five times in a row. I didn't know if Ryu's sound was so good. It's over i found my self
=
Yu Ji-ae's nuclear fist is not dangerous because his fist is sore. At the right moment, it is dangerous because it causes a heart attack. Let's walk the Avengers only, Euhulk.
=
Lovelyz I'm so good I feel like showing off myself when I take off the mask under the moonlight TT TT TT And make me chew while wearing the mask again ㅠ TT I think it reminds me every time the moonlight comes up
=
Where was the introduction and the last part Ryu Soo Jung ?; I will bow in that way
=
Lovelyz seems to have a new genre of music that has been changed from the color of the group. I wish I could be active with these songs
=
I think it's a very mysterious stage. It feels like lions dancing under the moon ... ♥ Lovelyz is the best!
=
The first part is so good
=
Now I found me The part was the best highlight The real feeling that this word shows Lovelyz's identity Everybody worked so nice and cool !! ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Lovelyz's voices are beautiful and elegantly melted, so it's so nice ㅠㅠ Lovelyz I love you so much ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠㅜ
=
Because the main vocal is always K
I think you gave him all the refrains.
This song is boldly done by other vocals
It's different.
=
Suddenly I thought down the stage than the note!
It's not real. I think ...
There is something that bothers or darkens Lovelyz, and I'll call it a.
-The first time wearing a mask and throws off.
a puts on a mask and teases Lovelyz; To get out of it, Lovelyz throws it off.
-Backdancer's Costume and Lovely's Costume
Back dancers are already enjoying what Free or Lovelys want, so they don't have a red stripe on their clothes. However, Lovelyz hasn't escaped from a yet and has a red stripe around her clothes.
-Even in my lyrics, I can't find me
a keeps Lovelyz trapped; somehow he loses something and moves as a man controls.
-Lyrics baby After you leave maybe fly in the night sky
As Lovelyz said, the body is tied up in a line (can't escape from a), so when he leaves a he finds himself.
-When the moon rises, the dazzling moon rises
Lovelyz knows he can't leave instinctively.
I'm so used to a life, but I want to leave, so I only listen to a when the curtain is up and try to leave when the curtain is closed.In the lyrics of a brilliant moonlit night, I know that a is only active in the dark. Demonstrate a willingness to flee during the day when the moon does not rise.
-I got only me
Lovelyz knows that only he can have himself.
-We're tired in the movie that ended in lyrics
Both a and Lovelyz are exhausted, but a can't let go of lovelys until the end.
-Happy ending that started in the lyrics Now I found me
This part can be interpreted in two ways.
Lovelyz is mistaken for being out of a, suggesting to show himself without being bound by a.
2.If you hear me now, I'm looking for me and I can hear it. Lovelyz is still missing from a, but Lovelyz is planning to get away from a.
-Last mask
This part is also related to the above 1,2. Three interpretations are possible.
1. Awakening from the illusion of being separated, implying that it will never escape from a; moreover, the stage is already darkened, and has already entered the realm of a.
2. Lovelyz will no longer be from a.
We are ready to escape, so if we wait for a to become inactive again, we can completely escape from a, indicating that Lovelyz's length will not flow just as a means.
Lovelyz already plans to get out of a but gets caught by a again, suggesting that he will never get out of a either. Unlike the interpretation of 1
It will not go away, it will not go just as a means, and willing to go further.
=
Wouldn't it be if Lovelyz succeeded in transforming the image? I sang well enough, and Lovelyz was doing well this time
I suffered Lovelyz!
=
Oh, I'm crazy. I don't want to be a big hit. I keep thinking and listening to it. I'll find it again.
=
It's good as if the song is crazy
=
Personally, Yoo Ji and Jin stand out on this stage. The atmosphere goes so well together.
=
The final song was so good
=
Honestly, I've been feeling since the sixth sense Ryu Sujeong song really good .. ㅠ I'm not a fan, but the voice is really over ㅠ TT is also the ability to make this voice not so far TT TT one point.
=
Part distribution genius genius ... and the name of the 떡 sol voice that is very good ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ thanks to the strong and solid treble is the best live song !!!!
=
This song seems to go well with Jin and Crystal.
=
Wow ... this time I wore shoes with ballet shoes ?? It's really good .... I was really looking forward to the stage every time I listened to the song. TT TT TT TT My sisters are the best.
=
Crystal, I knew K was good.
Gin, baby soul tone, quantity really attractive.
I met Rubbly with Queendom (I only knew the bells, triangles, and Achu). I felt this group was a vocal rich man.
=
The most narcissistic song is Moonlight. I keep hearing it.
=
And the song is too sniper TT Lovely Love Concept
=
I'll write 3 comments in this video ...
I'm so good, I want to tell you
=
This song dance is so full of my sister
(Honestly, the camera is too moving and I can't see it ;;)
=
Lovelyz is the best I ripped it incredible Awesome sisters You are the best
=
I don't know, I keep thinking about the night when the dazzling moon rises
=
I'm not sure I've never been in Loves, but I'm curious to see how many main vocals I saw on the stage, especially the chorus. I'm so memorable. I don't know the lyrics yet, but the melody itself is memorable.
=
The larger the group, the more important is the planning of the planning agency.
=
This song is infinitely repeatable because of the sound source gel
=
The chorus that other members sing well goes well, and Kay is all this freedom.
=
Lovelyz TT TT TT I've been stressed and overwhelmed by the bad comments that I couldn't have imagined so much harder than I imagined. I hope to win more in the future ...
=
Why doesn't everyone talk about Park Myung again?
=
Ryu Sujeong song absorption power is not playful. I heard my face and voice for the first time
=
왘 Crazy song, but good to the stage
=
Really this song baby soul is really awesome
=
Real tears ... I've been trying to give the concept of a girl crush that fans wanted to see in the early days.It was really hurting even if I saw it. I've been ridiculous since then and it's so nice that the comment window is clean. Lovelyz has always been # 1 in my mind.
=
Cameo reminded me one day
This song also reminds me of the stage change ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Lyrics changed to happy ending started from the sad ending ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The song is really my style and it's so good but the stage is too short.
=
Ryu Soo-jung Introduction What is the real ... tone chudoat ;;;; The Moonlight Concept ㄹㅇ It goes so well with the Lovez, not Innocent Oh, but it was the same in the real sound source, but the crystal is just the Moonlight itself, the second section of the chorus, and the Apgaonnimi in the second part
=
Lovelyz seems to have gained meaning with this song.
I think I've digested the final stage better than I expected.
I'd like to have a queen buff on my next comeback.
=
It's like a dancer dancing in the moonlight. In Korea, a little softly lit rabbit shining in a waterfall under the moonlight
The fairies are not gorgeous, but they seem to be wearing elegant wing clothes.
=
This song is the best of the Queen Final songs.
=
Moonlight is different from the music that Lovelyz has been doing, and it's a new way of trying music.
=
This is what makes Lovez's merits (clear tone) well differentiated from the concept of Lovez ...
If the existing Lovelyz has done a lot of stages like the goddess of the clear blue moon, will you bring bad luck this time? Feel like a mysterious red moon goddess!
The sound source was good too, but the stage concept was so good !! Even if the ringing sounds like a dog cake, the ears to listen to the song are amazing.
=
Baby Soul's voice is really awesome. Wow ~~~~
=
It seems that the moon lady who has been caught according to prophecy and has been guarding the shrine since she was young runs for her life on the bright moon
=
The stage is all-time, why is Mnet always unhappy with the camera?
=
The index tone is really good.
=
The stage effect is a bit unfortunate. The high-pitched or dance part has a little dark background.
=
Good beyond the stage. Especially Jean? This tone is too my taste ...
=
I've always thought about it, but K-voice is really mature.
=
Wow ... I wanted to do this ... ㅠㅠ Something different from the innocent concept of Lovelyz in the dark and dreamy and strange .... Really ... ㅠ
=
The rituals of the moon girls are so well together
The song style was a song that I had never heard of in my albums before.
I loved all the Lovelyz so far, but I will love any future lovelys.
I applaud all the teams that are with Queendom.
=
Big Crystal Small Crystal Tone Crazy
=
A little goddess or angel concept seems to be alright.
=
The sound of the brush is good.
=
Why do you want to do this?
=
Soxol vocals are so good
=
I think I've grown so well through Hull Queendom. I wish I could grow more in the future. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The song's future direction
=
I think it's going to come out in Greek and Roman mythology Something like heaven and the song is so good
=
It's a favorite song these days because it sounds so attractive.
=
I'm so tired of 8 people. I wish I had a lot to get through Queendom. And we'll meet at the next stage. 8 people have worked hard to squeeze, organize, and practice all night. I think I'm in a hurry .. Suh Ji Soo She's so pretty Anyway, let's win the rubly I love you so much I love you so much
=
It's a real goddess too. I was surprised because it was so pretty
=
The title is moonlight, so it seems to be a bit of an artemis.
=
I was really full of energy on the stage I saw.
=
I found out once again that people are really bad
Should I be sarcastic and ridiculed? It may be unfortunate to miss the stage, but I didn't want it to hurt the other person; It's really bad. The limits seem to be set by the public.
=
I think it's good for part distribution. is not it??
=
Really good dogs
=
I love this song so much ... Baby Soul's voice is so quiet.
=
No. Lovelyz said she should do it because she was serious about dancing.
I think this is the central cam or personal direct cam
=
What does it feel like?
❤I feel like it's just lovely❤
=
Each member has a vocal feature
Samsol: A little bit of Ambasa.
Jiae: It is dreamy but the dark side and the bright side coexist mysteriously
Jisoo: It's a dream but it's a little different. It's like whispering quietly in the moonlight.
Americas: Powerful and unique but sexy and innocent
Kay: It seems like there's a lot of vocals
Gin: A vocal that exudes emotional and shameful feelings
Correction: Husky is sexy, innocent, acoustic, etc.
Y: I feel like I'm jealous, but I have a pulpit
=
Descendant of the resounding moon was the martial art! Destiny, daylight-dreaming Moonlight really hits
=
Lovelyz science sensibility
I learned earth science with Destiny.
=
No one cares about Jin's short hair.
=
A few years ago, I fell in love with the song "You are not alone".
=
Yea, can I change my hairstyle? I can't break up with her.
=
Every time you see an elite lantern, it gets cold all the time,
=
This yellow song isn't just an impact but I dig into my heart, and I really love you. I love you so much. I've worked so hard.
=
Really good too ...
=
Lovelyz T: Main Vocal Baby Soul. At last, Baby Soul, the first part of the treble, was actually a rapper. But with unexpected talents, Meboham Mebo Merap
=
Choreography with dancers and choreography on the floor would be creepy if you look at the whole thing.
=
JIN Voice Creepy ...
=
The K sound itself is so soft that it is better to use it as a voice that enhances the song's lyricity or neutralizes the part that is too soft. There are a lot of kids in the song story development that have a little calm focus and good tone.
=
Ryu Soo-jeong was at the center of Lovelyz, at least this Queendom.
=
Crystal ox brush voice is really good
=
Crystal is full of hair ㅠㅠ
=
Jin? I'm so cute with a bird's beak.
=
Park Myung is a wet short hair ㅠㅠ crazy ㅠㅠ
=
Lovelyz This concept is also very good.
=
During the Lovelyz Mebo line, I learned the important things about Huxol. Genuine introduction genius Ryu Soojung, led by the whole part is very good ㅠ
=
0:36 1:41 What's this part of my style ... I haven't been listening to it since Six Senses, but today I heard a cameo and heard a moonlight.
=
Towing and crystal no real tone really good
=
I've been so accused in the contest, and if I don't do it well in the next contest, I can't help but worry too much.
=
The crystal is so pretty .. Really pure and dreamy concept well digested and so pretty everyone ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The other stages were good, but I keep thinking about it. Lovelyz ㅠㅠ I keep coming back to see it.
=
Honey jam
=
Baby Soul, Ye-in / Jisoo Jin Ji-ae Crystal / America Kay The voice seems softer as you go to the right. Middle voices seem to go well with any song. Each one has its own characteristics, so I think it's important to distribute the song accordingly!
=
This concept is so good ...
=
Baby Soul tone is good, .... Hopeful beat and white dress Clean and clear tone 3 beats, take off the mask and feel like a bird to fly freely. ㅡ
=
We were having a hard time with the lumps
=
I love singing so I always come to hear ㅠㅠ refrain melody line is so good
=
Lovelyz's sad and sad feeling adds a little bit of maturity and mystery, so it seems like a new genre that only Lovelyz can do. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ This is what I wanted ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ In the end, I showed off the best stage and popped Yoojong Seems to have gained meaning
I think it would be great to go with this feeling in the future!
=
Lovelyz is really a dream come true
=
Jean Short hair like Goddess Artemis ... Crystal refrain Tone crazy crazy
This concept is so fast !!!!!
=
1:07
At this time, my voice and choreography ㄷㄷ ㅠㅠ I love you!
=
In the Queen Lovelys stage,
I really liked this stage but it's a pity that there are few views .. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
The song is really tight.
=
The pitch seems to be the most stable right now.
I used to sing high, then high, and didn't know to sing differently than the original pitch
This time I got to know Queendom
=
I'm sorry, but I can only see Ryu Soo Jung.
=
I love Samsol ㅠㅠ Sing forever,
=
Look at it. Let's do it.
=
If you go to the writing of God is also a number .... Something dreary but feeling alive well
The bottom line is that elites are geniuses ....
=
In fact, the moon is not hovering the earth, but the earth is orbiting it.
=
Soul sister kiss me ... ♥
=
It's barefoot. What's the ratio? I'm just envious
=
I sing well.
=
I really liked the song
=
Ryu Soo Jung's voice is crazy.
I look at the face of Lee Ji-joo.
I drank a lot of gin and the gel dried
Lovelyz, I love you so much ❤️❤️
=
Lovely
Leeds song is really good, especially Jin who are really good
=
Soxol Styling ... Real work Cody ..... Soxsol Why mebo?
There is a uniqueness that is essential to the refrain when it hits.
=
I love you so much ㅠㅠ ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I love you
=
It's a really infinite repeating angle. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ 벱 SOL Powerful treble holding good.
=
Ryu Sujeong is a real jewel Jewelry ...... Pretty tone and crazy absorption Absolutely versatile
=
You are so good at composing.
=
Every time I see Ryu Sujeong, I really admire the song.
=
Princesses did the best, all the good luck ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Too hard to work
=
It's really ㅠㅠㅠ It's better than the concept that doesn't fit like Black Achu or Sixsen.
=
Real dogs
=
I love you so well, it's the best
=
Soul is hit by Lovely's vocal lobpong with no lineup
=
The pros and cons of this pro
1. Rank. Up and down
2.The fandom sucks the largest
=
Songs, choreography, concepts, stages, and members' appearances are all perfect stages.
=
Ryu Soojung was born to introduce this song .....
=
1:02 Yoo Ji-ae's face and voice are so pretty.
=
This isn't just a legend's Lovelyz fan, but I've turned this over 10 times.
=
It's a bit new because Kay doesn't call me chorus
People love this
=
It was so good because it was my voice.
=
Ryu Soo Jung's intro voice is crazy
His voice looks so good
In this way, I would like to give you a soothing and powerful song in the center of Huxol Ryu Su Jung.
Personally, I like it more because I write less Americas.
Every time I listen to a song,
It's not a swear word but just a personal review.
=
K voice is so good
=
Real part time job was so good
=
2:22 Crazy. Crazy. I come all day to see this.
=
I've been struggling since leaving the rankings. ㅠㅠㅠ Sisters are the best. Thank you for doing so well without regrets.
=
It's really new because there are a lot of other members
=
Baby Soul's voice is so good. It's a sound gang.
=
After all, the idol was not able to be played with his skills. By the way
=
This stage part is really good because it fits in with each member ㅠㅠ In particular, there are 4 mebo classes. Until now, I thought that 벱 sol and jin have relatively few parts because of the unique color of Lovelyz, but song refrain is especially good for 벱 sol and jin. ㅠㅠ ㅠ sol high-pitched parts
Ryu Soo Jung Visual Appearance
=
2:14 This part facial acting is so good.
=
Gin's cute dog
=
K, Myeong-eun, and Huxol Mebo are three. ㅠㅠㅠ It depends on who sings more.
Which group would you be like this?
Let's go to Dam Comeback this way too!
=
Really Lovelyz Too good and toiled and all-time level The only place in my mind is Lovelyz Let's just go ahead and fight ~ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Soul voice ..
=
If you want to sing, you can do it, but you've blamed and laughed at why you don't fit. Somehow, I'll just give up and drop out. Lovelyz went to the end. The members showed everything on the screen how embarrassing and self-confident they seemed. Those who know Lovelyz have come to love and love Lovez more.
=
It's not empty words, and this song and stage are so good.
There's plenty of time, and we'll be there all the time, cheering and waiting for you. Lovelys as the name says, I hope you guys see the light now.
=
벱 The voice is so good ....
=
Wow, this concept is really ... I'm crazy.
=
I don't have a baby's voice, so the tone is pretty.
=
The song is really good ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Songs are so hot ..... I'd love to do it ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I think it's grown a lot. Lovelyz-chan.
=
Ryu Su-jeong's tone is really good
=
My standard song is the best of 6 teams
=
The stage composition using the mask was so good and the lovelyz is the best.
=
Wow, Jean short hair looks really good .... I did so well. Really ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
3:04 From this part, I really like the dog .. No matter how you listen to it, the accompaniment melody is really good.
=
Lovelyz's sister fighting!
My best 1st group. ❣
=
Wow, this concept goes well.
=
벱 Sol high treble is good to hear ㅠㅠ K I just called high treble but I like to listen a lot as well, I like to hear a lot more than usual ㅠㅠ
=
Queendom is good .. the tone is so pretty
=
Even if I can't do it in a day, I will look for 2 times. Lovelyz is the best ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ❤❤❤
=
Ah, I'm going to be a fan of Ryu Soojung since I forgot deep blue.
=
What
Good selection of the last song;
=
I'm going to be happy even if I push you out
=
2:50 TT TT I love you so much .... I want you to make this tone stand out in your usual parts :(
=
I really love you Ryu Sujeong so much with Xabi and Ryu Sujeong
=
This is my first concept, but the song is so good, especially the Ryu Sujeong tone is so good.
=
It's already been a month ... Thursday without Queendom
=
Why do you think of this? Are your clothes similar? Something secret, bizarre and dreamy.
=
Moonlight song is so good This is amazing
Good mix of pop and song, vocals
It's so new and nice. It's not just a contest song.
I don't feel tired for a long time
=
What's this? Lovelyz Six Senses came in. This song is Jona Joan.
=
This song is really good.
=
It's not a top idol. The song is so good and the stage is so good!
=
Lovelyz goes well with this concept! I feel the members' heartfelt growth through the Queendom. It was so nice to have a lot of enthusiasm in meeting and meeting ideas than meetings in the first round! Although Queendom has the purpose of a girl group contest, it's good to see that the girl group learns so much while watching other groups' meetings and performances! All girl groups are fighting :)
=
ㅋㅠㅠ
=
Crystal tone real treasure
=
Jisoo and Tow
=
I love many gin parts
=
I was so surprised to hear that my mouth was shut ... This legend, but who said "Lovely choreography dance". Rhythm rhythm with this stage ^^
=
I've been watching Jikcam but I like Jikcam better
It's even live .., what did you do with Mnet?
=
Jin, Hussol vocals are good, but mebo, ribo and parts, give Ryu Soo-jeong, and Cayman.
=
벱 sol
=
He is so good at singing.
=
Most people say that it's true that Lovelyz came out of the Queen's Kingdom, but I think it's kind of profitable. On the contrary, I think it was Lovelyz than anyone who came here and learned and felt a lot. I'm sure that I will grow more and give back to the good stage. I'm so hard and unconditional. Hope not jin ...
=
Jin and the soul are really good
=
Jin is so cute
=
I'm really awesome ... I feel like I've been following Soul and Jiae a lot !!!!
=
Jiae's voice is so good.
=
I'm so lovely
=
Oh, I love songs so much, I'm indefinite repeating TT.
=
One shot is really the best.
=
Lovelyz, I'm the best ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ♥ ️ ♥ ️ ♥ ️ ♥ ️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
And singing are really addictive
=
Crazy really dogs are good .... like a warrior ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ TT ㅠㅠㅠ I'm a cool sleeper ... I'm not active in this song ...?
=
It's really coming,
=
New song
=
Lovelyz said that a group with a strong vocal was in harmony with each other rather than singing well.
=
I'm not a lovely fan but I did really well
=
Umsol ... I've got a lot of real parts and I'm so stable and I'm good at it from the last time
=
America, no, who's so pretty
=
Baby Soul vocal refreshing feeling
=
2:22 The best voice of all
=
I think this song goes so well with the crystal tone.
=
I don't know how many times I'm in vocal addiction.
=
This is so pretty .. 2:50
=
It was a stage where all the members could see each other. Really everyone looked like crazy and ㅠㅠ Everyone's concept and lovely stage of life ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow
=
Introductory dog ​​is good because it is repeating infinitely
=
The song is really good and it's so nice to see all the members.
=
I feel like discovering a new concept of Lovelyz by watching this video.
Oh good
=
I don't know if it's because of mecup.
=
I'm a kid's fan, but it's suddenly buzzing in my ear
=
It's so powerful and good to have 3: 3
=
The song was good and the stage was very good. Antis will try to take any excuses. Don't worry. Like your favorite artist.
=
Do you have to win this?
=
It's over 1.4 million I still see it
=
While watching the Queendom, I felt that Lovelyz was a very mature, mature and strong inner team. It was good to see how the public thought about the team.
=
Lovelyz next concept I hope this kind of thing ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's really a pity camera ... this is a full cam
=
Wouldn't this be what people wanted? It's so creepy that I'm always out there. I thought it was pure, young, cute, pretty and nice lovely debut when I made my debut. It's been so hard to do it. The more I look at it, the more I think I would have been like Oh My Girl Closure or Twilight.
=
Sister's face is so nice ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It seems a bit mixed with the harvest goddess and the moon goddess.
=
The crystal is torn off at the beginning.
=
Song Jua
=
Ryu Soo-jeong's tone has opened ... I want to keep listening
=
Moonlight Angels Shoot as humans and find me now! While the blackened girls are over-immersed and loved by Lovelyz ㅠㅠㅠ Really sweet ㅠㅠ ㅠ other artists also did a really good job
=
Lovelyz fits into the real universe and Destiny fits into the real universe.
=
It's creepy because of the soul tone and I like the whole melody.
=
Good introduction and brush parts ㄹㅇ
=
This time I sang really well
=
This concept is good.
=
Real Ryu Soo-jung Baby Soul voice goes so well together
=
I think I've been so good at distributing parts in the song that I've been out so far.
=
Ryusujeong introduction crazy sound
=
Originally, if it was a melody but a youthful melody, this time, you can think of it as a melody. So it's a lovely color
=
It's not that crystal hair is so fast. Why is it so good and pretty?
=
Song is so good ❤️
=
Lovelyz, I'm cheering for you.
=
Crystal voice over good ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The song itself was so good that I expected it, but I did so well as expected. Lovelyz Thank you Lovelyz and composer in the north, south, east and south because I don't know where you are. And then the house upstairs came up and I shouted so loudly.
=
No matter how much you look, you're so pretty, please free Soo Ji's hair ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow ... it's so good. Lovelyz The stage is getting so cool and good, but it's over here ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
And this time the concept is crazy
=
And the song is really good
=
Lovelyz was good to be able to grow one step through Queendom
=
I can't tell who the modern costume is a celebrity and a back dancer.
=
Ming is John Wong
=
This song has been around for a while now.
=
Lovelyz
=
More than cameo, this sounds lovely. When others listen to this song? Lovelyz? But if you're a fan, you've already imagined it on stage. Last week, I'd hate it because it's Lovelyz. Everyone wants to show you various concepts as a singer, but whatever you say, do whatever you want to do. There's a creepy noise in the high-pitched back part, but I don't know why Lovelyz sings treble so badly. Thank you for your hard work and effort to prepare for Queendom ♡
=
The song is really classy.
=
It's so pretty
=
Jeonju part is really good
=
01:11 Apa Aya, Aia ...?
=
I hope that Lovelyz and all the women living in 2019 will be free. What we love, what may or may not fit, what we do for the first time, what we have dreamed of, what I am used to and do well, what I want to do, and what freedom I can do at the time I want to do everything we can Do not doubt that it is. I keep supporting such Lovez.
=
The stage was really really really good
=
It's a dog song. Why are you still playing good songs?
=
What did the members say to the Temple of Artemis at the beginning of this song? If you do the same ritual and have a modern dance in the middle, this stage was good, but it would have been better !!
=
Fans are happy as if Lovelyz plays on any stage, so I want you to do everything you want to do. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I love it because she doesn't have to talk about her.
=
Lovelyz songs are all good together
=
I love you
=
Moonlight shines on melon bucks genie chart
=
3:14 What is Ryu's hair color?
=
I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I think this stage was really good.
=
I really want to see the cameo all week, but I only want to do it well, I'm only NG. I've been around for a while and I'll pretend I don't know.
=
It was a clothes legend that was like ours now, but sincerely, baby, any concept is good.
=
I really like your voice, Lovelyz ....
=
Songs are good ㅠㅠ Like infinite swimming
=
Queendom is the last.
=
I didn't know it right after the final, but when I listened to the final song, I liked this song.
=
Crystal tone is too beautiful
=
Good. It's worth the song again. Lovelyz makes you listen more than once in a single shot. And make me feel jewelry.
=
I just love you all the moments of Lovelyz All the stages All stages Lovelyz never disappointed fans this time I was really expecting this stage but exceeded the expectations Do it well and just have me
=
Only Ryu Soo Jung's 1 solo song
=
It's nice to have Jin get his head on at 2:16.
=
Lovelyz Sometimes do dark purity like this ~~
=
Since the song is really good, please do some activities with this title ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Lovelyz You did so well
All the stages that I've seen in Queendom so far have been so good and wonderful to me. Thank you so much for Lovelyz for showing me a lot of concepts.
=
So beautiful
=
This is this ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I feel like I've added a bit of power and darkness in a dim and dreamy concept like Gau Sauu.
=
K-hair and costume
=
It's good for the first time, but it's better for the second time.
=
Personally, I'm pretty at this time.
=
Why is there no index part?
=
Moon Artist Lovelyz will always cheer :)
=
Strangely, there were few mentions of Lovelyz in SNS, but I don't understand at all. I'll continue to support Lovelyz. I listen to this song well and listen to it repeatedly.
=
I like all of them, but I especially like the Ryu Soo-jeong tone.
=
Baby Soul's voice is a real star. It's a treasure
=
I don't know how many times I'm watching. Very good. Lovelyz's own story.
=
Fairy line in Greek mythology
=
Soul ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Too good for sculpture month, my sister is the hero now Cheer sister
=
Lovelyz is growing.
=
Baby Soul, please let me have a lot of money .... ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Renovation ah ah ㅠㅠ most million !!!
=
The song I heard recently
=
It's much nicer because it doesn't make a baby voice. Ryu Soo Jung is a truly unique tone
=
Oh, really crazy ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Very good, especially when the 벱 sol comes out with a strong beat ... Please write more ....
=
1 moonlight per day
=
Park Myung is sincerely opening patrons I didn't know it in the past
=
Seriously ㅠㅠ
=
Soul Tone Okeke ;;;
=
The songs and the voices of the kids were all good, but the camera walking was so great and the kids had nothing to complain about.
=
This was good, but I'm glad I got some kind of beauty at the end
=
Personally, it was the best stage, song, and concept of the lovely stage in Queendom. It feels much richer, more sexy and mature than being sexy powerful like a sixth sense or a sexy version of Achu. The vocals are so powerful that they are different from the original Lovelyz song. Good
One of the songs I know.
=
I'm crazy, I'm crazy
=
But Ryu Soojung is getting more and more beautiful at every activity.
=
Sister I cry ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's like I'm not going to lie over 200 times.
=
S..Crystal sister's hair color.
=
I remember Lovelyz, children, and Oh My Girl three goddesses. Lovelyz is Moon Goddess Artemis, children are strong feeling god (I can't think of a name), Oh My Girl thinks of Poseidon or Athena. Or it feels like a little war between fire (children) and water (oh my girl), but it feels like Lovelyz will intervene in the middle.
=
Seo Ji-soo Why is it so bad?
=
The more you listen to this song, the more the song is like a SAT. It's so good to keep moving around.
=
The song was too good to be used as a real contest ㅠㅠ It was awesome. Lovelyz Various concepts go well together.
=
Lovely group lacking expression
=
I'm so good to see you guys .. you guys were first place .. I've had a lot of hard work.
=
This song is awesome.
=
I sing in the moonlight karaoke
=
The concept is so good, the choreography is so good and the choreography that emphasizes the sexy dance line is beautiful. The beauty is exploding.
=
When the accompaniment comes out
=
It's the best of all the title tracks of the song Lovelyz.
=
Park Myung has a lot of parts, so tears ㅠㅠ I'm sick of seeing only one or two measures every time I saw me finally TT TT I'd like to give this song to my euneun
=
So good ~
=
I'm not a fan, but I like the taste of gel in the final song of the Queendom.
=
Baby Soul
=
Seo Ji-soo is a real John .. I'm really good at acting. Replying to @Breakfast
=
Ryu Soojung's voice was amazing. I wasn't interested in it but I had to listen to it.
=
Addictive
=
The clothes are so pretty and the songs are so good. The mask is so creepy.
=
Good combination of ox brush and jean voice
=
There are a lot of Artemis ... ?? Meanwhile, K-Onning's hairstyle looks like an elf. !! ♥♥
=
This is Queen's Lovel's mouth ㅠㅠ Real members each voice is attractive and good ㅠㅠ
=
I came to see you crazy today ... This is a drug song.
=
Wow, I broke the pot last time.
Everybody goes so well, but as soon as I listened to this song, Baby Soul got a good voice.
I was also impressed at the time of Sixteen, but if I get a song that goes well with it, it seems to be a vocal with a poten. The rest of the members are 홧띵 !!
=
Ooh ... the atmosphere is amazing
=
Ryu Soo Jung
=
Ah so good ♥♥
=
Originally, Lovelyz had a bright image, but this time it's just a good job.
=
I wanted to hear a cappella once in Queendom .. ㅠㅠ Lovelyz is good at cappella !!
=
I love song so much ㅠㅠ Covered
=
I love you ~~~ ㅠㅠ
=
I'm catching your eyes from the crystal cameo ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ World attractive facial expression tone ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Give me one solo crystal ...
=
It's just crazy from the beginning 0:36 I heard a dazzling moon night and creepy and raised the sound of Zonjera. So good!! Lovelyz a cappella, but I'm sorry I didn't show you in Queendom.
=
This is not on the melon chart .....
=
It's a stage where you can feel a lot of charming vocals in Lovelyz.
=
Good job ♥
=
I think Lovelyz sounds as a brush and crystal. The tone is also good. It sounds like the singing voice is acting, but it's a pity that K seems to break the mood in some songs because it's a defined voice. But from the Queendom, I wanted to cheer because I seemed to try hard to change myself.
=
Ryu Soojung's voice was more stable, so the treble part Ryusujeong would have been good
=
Ryu Soo-jung's voice is really attractive
=
Moonlight stage is good
1. If you had a bright and cute concept, the moonlight is just a little child.
2. Onelan Lovely's vocals were the ones who received a lot of spotlights in Japan, but after this stage, the samsung, crystal, and progress vocals were firmly revealed.
3. The original Kay's voice and parts have a lot of Kay, if the pop bounced well, this time the parts are well distributed seems to have done their part well.
4. I had a lot of swearings in the two contests, but after that I got a good reputation in the cameo. If this stage was unfortunate, I would continue to run bad, but this stage also proved to be a growing love .
=
Reflect on Mnet footcam. Really.
=
It's a concept dog.
=
Thank you for all the lovely things
I've loved it since the beginning of my debut and I'll support you from now on !! My sisters really really enjoyed the stage !! See what's good and listen to what's good❤️❤️❤️LoveHayong
=
I love you guys Lovelyz is number one for me❤ Did you know why you're late? Thank you for coming out of the Queendom.
=
It was a stage where the quality of the song was good and the members were outstanding.
=
The song is so good .. If you sing with this concept, I'll pop.
=
Sing it all around you If you sing a lot of baby soul songs !!
=
I'll keep listening to this song
=
This song is a generation-wide level. Likewise, this concept is going to be more amazing.
=
The song is really nice. Well made song.
=
Ryu Sujeong
=
I think it's Korean version of pop song! ㅠㅠ
=
ring. If you are watching this comment, the next concept is like this
=
To be honest, it would have been huge
=
벱 Sol highlight Listen to the treble and goose bumps continue to increase the weight like this ㅠ Soul voice is good
=
Honestly, this song is almost the best of the Queen's Finals, but the sixth sense is so strong that people haven't found much of Lovelyz ever since.
=
This song fits all the members of Lovelyz
Goes well
=
I love you so much. I'm listening to the Queendom song every day.
=
Lovelyz's strongest weapon
Like a housework
Everybody is so cool ♡
=
It's a dreamy, mature and somehow mysterious concept, but it's a mysterious voice that's perfect for a chorus.
=
It was like a dark dream concept, so it was nice to see the stage! The song goes well with this atmosphere
=
The song is really good
=
♡♡♡
=
The song was good and the stage was good !! Lovelyz Fighting ❣
=
Came out to karaoke !! Please be active quickly, please.
=
The members were red clothes and white ropes. I think it would stand out more ... The first place in my heart is Lovelyz. It's been a few weeks and I'm still listening 10 times a day.
=
I think it would have been better if the costumes were different from the dancers.
=
I wanted this stage ...
=
What kind of Greek goddess do you think? ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It is good over song ♡♡♡♡
=
Creepy through the song
=
Good refrain
=
벱 Solpart is an addictive clay tone and it's attractive.
=
Sound! Another girl group music video came out Let's take a video too !!!!
=
I've only seen elites since kind Mr. Jinja ... You're so pretty.
=
I like this song the most ^^
=
Why is Ryu Soo-jeong crazy? Are you a person? What can't you do?
=
Cody, it's good. I can't distinguish it from the back dancer. From a distance, I can't tell.
=
It's so special. It's so impressive and calm. I think I know what it feels like to have an impact.
=
Look at the atmosphere of Yuji
=
Crystal tone true story
=
Baby Soul It was annoying to use it
=
This song is not just a girl or a girl but also fits a group called Lovelyz
=
I'm serious ... I'm never going to stop loving them
=
Stage where crystal and crystal are saved ㅎㅎㅎ
=
Lovelyz-Goddess of the Moon
Children-Goddess of Fire
Oh My Girl-Goddess of Water
Park Bom-Goddess of Autumn
Mamamu-Goddess of the Wind
aoa-like the goddess of the earth .....
=
Ryu Soojung's hair goes well together ..
=
I like the song sword
=
The brush is so good.
=
I think this song is good too
=
Singing good Ryu Soo Jung voice
=
It's the best lovelyz stage I've seen in Queendom.
=
I really like this stage atmosphere
This is my concept
=
It's good because it's straight from the crystal
=
Ryu Soo-jeong's tone is really ...
=
Is it Lovelyz? I really chose the song ~
=
What's the camera?
I can't go on stage
=
I think it would be nice to have a heat brush
Moon would have been nice to Kay.
=
? I heard it in advance, but the full version is better than I thought I was surprised .....
=
I almost choreographed the camera with Lovelyz, hey.
=
It looks so comfortable ...
=
Crystal voice sounds good
=
It's like a real growth cannon in Queen's.
=
Crystal Soul Gin Kee Holy Strong Vocal
It was a bit unfortunate to have Cayman who had a line, but it was good to show why the vocals are strong as the part distribution is evenly distributed.
=
Lovelyz has grown a lot
=
Good job! Lovelyz, don't worry about bad guys!
=
I don't think it's Lovelyz. Don't call me like caustics all the time.
=
Tone Too Good
=
The song is so good
=
1:44 Fly free and wave! And elites who fly at the same time .. That hand gesture is so smooth and good.
=
Oh, really, Cody is wearing Soul-Anti or some clothes and perm to make it fatter.
=
The red rope tied to the body, mask, song lyrics, and each one symbolically. It's been a long way through Queendom, but I'm glad I've finally found the coolest color they can.
=
Let's play this song
=
Samsol vocals are so good
=
Are you looking at your agency?
=
Hair styling ... who knows who you are ... it's so awesome .... Solkei wave goes so well together ♡. ♡♡♡♡
=
The voice sounds strong so I think I'm buying more songs itself.
=
It's like they're prophesying when they're at war with children
=
So good ㅠㅠ This is Lovelyz
=
This song is the best
=
This song is really good. Wow.
=
But 8 people are so pretty ... ❤
(There's a baby soul who's ugly, but if you lose weight a little, you're pretty.
=
Honestly, Lovelyz Queendom, I wanted to get out of their image a bit, so I thought sexy concept and Sixty Gal concept at the time, but if you want to get away from the cute image, this mature and dreamy concept is too fast.
=
If you're bad, you don't want to watch the Six Senses stage.
=
I love baby soul treble
=
Wow. This song.
=
Soul voice is so good ??
=
The part is full.
=
Artemis is reborn.
=
Jean short
=
It's like temple priests in Greek and Roman mythology.
=
Currently, Jin.K.Hexol is a mebo, but even a couple of mebos can be promoted as a lead singer with Yein and America. Jiae and Jisoo are also good at personal concerts. It seems to be able to match the color of music and to be trendy as well.
=
This is a concept sniper, but are you not active with this song?
=
Good good !!! I teared the stage of Lovelyz
=
One by one is art. There is no such group .. all voices are pretty
=
1 million views soon
=
Lovelyz Sister I love you pretty everyone
=
Look twice in full cam version. Home camera is really a waste.
=
Like the moon goddess Artemis! Oh Yea Costume
=
Soft knife, it's hard to beat
=
I think this concept goes well with my personal thoughts.
=
Ryu Soo Jung Voice Ant
=
Lovelyz is not Mesosol Kay Jin Ryu Jung
=
I want to go to Lub Con
=
I don't know if soul is pretty
=
It's innocent and sexy and at the same time has a mysterious feeling and a good song. In the early days, it seemed that I didn't know how to do it.
=
All 8 people started to see the visuals from the real couple ... Lovelyz This concept goes so well together ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Where did the exponent part go ...
=
I like this song first place !!!
=
Ryu Soo-Jung looks really good
=
Most of my clothes are pretty
=
I definitely felt it, but in the xabi or treble part, it feels more tactile than the K. It seems like the powerless highs somewhere somewhere in the part of K's solo, and the original range is mid-low, but I tried to widen the range. The voice is high and thin, so it sounds like a high note. On the other hand, the 벱 sol really pulls out and spits out a powerful sound.
=
Kay seems to have a better bass than real highs.
=
Yes, it's like a nine-tailed fox
=
Put it in the next album and act as a stage!
=
Good song
=
Soul is a real goddess in Greek mythology.
=
Lovelyz❤
=
Kay always calls the main part, so the Lovelyz song always looks alike. Jin, crystal, ox brush, and each of them have different personalities.
=
Imizu tone sound
=
It's so pretty. I think it's too small.
=
Lovelyz, you've worked so hard ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Lovelyz is the best ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
Rang, please do this concept. I'm cute. This was by far the best stage I've ever seen ;;
=
I don't have any mention of it, but Yu Ji-ae's original voice is really good ... I thought it wasn't a real voice, but I didn't know it was such a husky feeling. Give
=
The song is so good and the outfit looks good too.
=
I'm not a fan, but the Lovelyz members worked very hard. ㅠㅠ During the Queen's stage, they were swearing at the early stages and suffered a lot of afflictions. I'm sorry to see you wearing sunglasses. Just because Lovelys' colors are so clear
=
Lovelyz is really a vocal .. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I think there is no team to win a lovely vocal of the 3rd generation girl group ㅠㅠㅠ Different tone, but also harmonious, clear and clean ㅠㅠㅠ Lovely sung song goes well and feels good. They're so good together that they're good at cappella and so on.
=
Good moon ... !!
=
I'm crazy ... ❤️❤️❤️
ㅠ Do whatever you want to do
=
Come see me every day
=
I've made sure that the concept of Lovelyz has changed.
=
So just tell me why she's so pretty? Is it the moonlight?
=
A dog song
=
It's a competing program, but it's music.
Dog
=
No Ryu Soo Are you crazy? I'm just promoting myself as a jewel. Really .. I'm going to lose light in front of you. Ha you're such a perfect person!
=
The lyrics are so authentic
=
I love you from the beginning of the house.
=
1:29 1:29 1:29 Baby Soul Here's what sounds good when you're baby
=
God light !!!
=
It's a pity that I seemed to have direction at the end.
=
I got a moonlight karaoke
=
And this was so good that I was creepy ;;;;, ;;;; I'm Going.

=
Why are there so many Lovelyz members?
=
The sound of the brush is good.
=
Rather, the chorus is done by Jin and Samsol
I feel more like this song
=
It's more than crystal and soul voice
=
This voice is good too ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I want to stop the baby's voice ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The dancers and the clothes are different.
=
It's been coming from this costume. It's the sky and it's showing up. Who's it? Title Moonlight and squirting ... How can it all be so good? I've heard so much since I came out that music. Live the rest of your life ...
=
Baby Soul Voice
=
Lovelyz Don't think about coming back
Just be active now !!!!!!!!!!! What are you doing?
=
Kay, I see that as soon as I see Aphrodite in Greek mythology.
=
Each person has a different digestive power, but honestly, I would like to have a big role with Crystal Sister and Mr. Big Crystal. Ah (big fix is ​​baby soul sister, but just fix sister is Ryu Soo Jung ning) And heavy gayageum? The sound was like the main character of this song because it came from end to end. Of course, the sound came out differently in the middle, but it was still good, and I think each voice used this song more. And everybody put the wave was seductive and nice. And why is this song digestive power so good? Do you have two trebles? jackpot. love.
=
Oh my god
=
Why was Ryu Soojung buried so far? It's really good at absorbing music and dancing. It's pretty good.

Nogizaka 46 Lovelys in Korea
=
Ong, the feeling of the moon
=
I think I've seen a movie ... It's like a musical and the vocals are so pretty ... Lovelyz has its own color. It was great to do the stage and did what I wanted to be like Six Senses !! The ridicule is weird. Lovelys best
=
Elf or Human?
=
Lovelyz seems to be a good opportunity to grow into a new recruit. There is a part that is compared with other teams, but this song is enough to make it into Lovelyz. It may be a representative song. It's amazing that 8 people can't find their personalities. Baby Soul Cody I'd like to have another 10 days.
It seems that this amnet has finally become Mnet. I have never seen such a warm program. QUENTEM 2 I want it right now!
=
The song is so good. concept?? Can you recommend another song for the same Lovelys,
=
I've only been a guerrilla because I'm a fan, but the other 5 groups are also good songs.
I like it completely,

I was surprised because it was so pretty.
=
Song remodeling ...
=
Lovelyz hasn't been a lovely one for a moment. From the cameo stage, it's now just Lovelyz. It's a stage that I want to do ... Even though it wasn't suitable for the people that Atsuna Six Sense was, it was a stage that Lovelyz wanted to do, and I passed it well without a big ride. I wonder if I can do something
=
Ji-ae's voice, I'm not a ding-dong girl.

I like the song, but I'm bored. Why are the dancers and clothes the same color?
=
Please ... Baby Soul Please dress up ... I feel like I'm buried.
=
What's best?
=
It's like goddesses hurt and betrayed by humans ...
=
Your sister is so beautiful.
I love you
The first place was done by moms
The first place in my heart is my sisters
Big sister and sister
I'm a sister and a sister and a sister.
I was pretty
Nadu was a woman
(No ~~~ I was pretty but today's sisters
What's up? ❤️❤)
=
You've taken Jiyoung's legend ....
=
I thought it would have been better if I had one more rap part, but I think I really cared about it a lot and the song is also good.
=
Of course, the original song is the same, but the Destiny stage covered by Oh My Girl was the same motion moon in the same image. It's blue, the red blue moon is covered by the sun, and the red moon absorbs the sun's light and spits it out with its own light. It's good that it's the same month but it has a different color ㅠ and something ㅋㅋ It's brain-fighting but it feels like I'm conscious of it because it's a contest program The atmosphere is reversed and I didn't know Lovelyz had this atmosphere
=
The most shocking stage of the final contest, where the impact and creepyness continued to rise, was children, but I was more attracted to Lovelyz's unique stage that made people most comfortable and smiles. It's good without it It's like the Lovelyz stage
=
Appreciation
=
You're so good ???????????
=
I did not take the song well and the sound and the power did not lag behind, but it was because I was so badly recognized in the middle and middle of the song. It's a song that's left over with the Queendom Finals, but it's a bit sad
The stage is also coordinating ...... ... I'm so sorry, I'd rather have a gypsy style or go to Greek doubles. I think it's good to have intro or danv like other teams. I can't erase my bored feeling
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Lovelyz stage video, please continue to talk about other groups !!!!
=
Kei's voice is elegant, and the girl crush would have been perfect for the sixth sense.
=
I'm hiding the vocal voice and ding dong dang !! Take
=
It's almost Kei's chorus, but the next comeback song is Kei's introduction, and Jung and Jin's refrain. The tone is so good when I sing ... I feel more mature when the treble is tuned, and the treble is a little newer. I love singing over !!
=
I think I've got some sense
Finals and fans live
=
Isn't this first?
=
I love you
It's so good these days that I don't have hot water.
Honestly, there's no reason to swear
=
It's really creepy Crazy Lovelyz No.1 !!!
=
Really, as I said, all the idols feel like the stage is going on; ;; You didn't mean to shoot a movie. Your sisters are so awesome and the story is automatically played in your head ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
21st century Guji ...
=
I think we can arrange something bright
=
She is so pretty
=
I'm sorry I only have gimbap in my head
=
Lovelyz songs are characterized by every single note from the beginning to the end, with no big impact. I love that part so much and the other songs have a lot of impact and the parts remain memorable. I feel a lot memorable, but it also stimulates my feelings, but people who don't know this haven't been able to do it this time. Lovely I don't have an impact. I don't know what I've done. Lovelyz, of course, it was good to see a variety of things from the sexy sexy received to the teen musical to the music that filled the atmosphere of their own music, of course, I was sorry that I did not see a cappella, which is the real strength of Lovelyz. These guys are really I'm fascinated. I don't want to show what they're good at, but I really want to show a variety of things. I felt challenged. Now I want to eat some of their lives towards the Afflictions.
=
It was all a great Queendom, but the team that most wants to reconsider is Lovelyz, except for a stage contest that fans want to see. No fixed image, so I was worried about coming out of Queendom, and I was worried about the mentality of the kids since Saxony, but it was useless worries ㅠㅠ Final up to this stage, Lovelyz's Queendom made all this a platform for growth Seemed to be on stage, but it was a crush stone.
=
This is really good TT TT Groups that started with a pure concept usually change the concept in the year after year but it seems to be so good with this
=
Personally it was better than cameo
=
Wow, it's a real concept. It's so pretty and it looks so good. I want to keep pushing this concept. Each member has improved a lot.
=
I loved the part distribution so well I was so good on the stage I felt like I'm getting more souled parts So I'm singing so well ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Personally, this concept fits so well It might be a good idea
=
This dream concept looks so good and I hope you did a lot in the future ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Lovelyz in Queendom All the stages I have enjoyed so much and I'm glad to find a new color that Lovelyz can handle at this final.
=
The first place in me is this ...
=
If you really hate Lovelyz ... I'm so good and hard.
=
Lovelyz
A bright moon rises at night
When the curtain comes up
Like the moonlight dances
Beautifully I
Throw me and hug me
Hold me tight
The more you leave
You tighten me tight
I have to finish it now
The day I forgot
All this freedom
It's over
I found myself
I'm already halfway
Sad ending
Now I found me
In the finished movie, we
I'm tired, but BABE
Be my own baby baby eh
Be my own baby
Be my baby
I want to fly freely
Take me out of my imagination
I lost my wings
Forgetting everything
Throw me and hug me
Hold me tight
The more you leave
Gently embrace me
I have to finish now
That
The day I forgot
All this freedom
It's over
I found myself
I'm already halfway
Sad ending
Now I found me
In the finished movie, we
I'm tired, but BABE
Be my own baby baby eh
Be my own baby
Be my baby
Where am i
Even I can't find me
Babe after you leave
Maybe
Fly in the night sky
I've got only me
I've got only me
In the finished movie, we
I'm tired, but BABE
Be my own baby baby eh
Be my own
It's over
I love myself
I erased you now
Happy ending started
I will find me again
In the finished movie, we
I'm tired, but BABE
Be my own baby baby eh
Be my own baby
Be my baby
=
Yachuo report, seeing Shiensen, it looks like this .. It's a feeling that Lovelyz is trying for the first time, but it's totally lovely voice.
And these are the babies that the members of Achulang and Saxen
=
Everyone is so pretty.
=
Of the final performances, this is the best song
=
Whoever said, Onepick in my mind has always been Lovelyz ㅠㅠ I was so happy to know more about the group called Lovelyz through Queendom and I was happy to hear various stages and wonderful songs
I've heard many bad words and bad words while I'm in Queendom. I practiced a lot of bruises and practiced a lot. ㅠㅠ Lovely group, like the name is always fighting! I love you All 8 lovelys suffered ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Back dancers are so distracted by the same fluttering clothes on the same white, but the song is super strong;
=
Huxol's voice is so good
=
This was great but it was a pity that the stage was much shorter than the other teams.
=
Oh, I really liked the stage.
=
Next comeback please with this kind of concept song
=
Next comeback please with this kind of concept song
=
Good job I really liked the song .....
=
I want to see you again I did a good job on stage I love you
=
What's the crystal tone really ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Very good
=
The song is really real
=
Wow .. Baby Soul.
=
Good song, good stage !! Lovelyz Fighting!
=
I feel like Greek Roman mythical goddess
=
Suction flow inlet suction
=
Lovelyz, you've worked so hard ♡♡
=
Let's come back to this
=
When you first come out Ryu Sujeong
=
And atmosphere ..
=
I was so busy listening to the music that I almost stopped listening to the music. But after the end, I kept watching it. Actually, I didn't like Rubbly, but it's sang and expresses well, so I stay in my head.
=
I love this song so much
=
This song goes well with Lovelyz
If you want to show me various stages that you do not want to shrug!
=
Lovelyz This song is so good !! Cheer up!
=
Lovelyz Horror goes well with you ... especially Hambaimo ..
=
Lovelyz Everything is amazing
=
This concept goes well with the song.
=
Lovelyz's genre is Lovelyz ... b
=
Song is so good
=
Good song
=
Concept Coal Asdal Chronicles Saya Thanya Silver Island ...
=
Rip ryu ㅠ
=
This song is so good ... Lovelyz has so much potential that I wish more people realized. I hope Queendom gave them the confidence and support needed to take it to the next level. Lovelyz Fighting!
=
Oh, the background and the clothes go well together! The kids are all pretty, the song is good ㅠㅠ The stage was fine, but it would have been cooler if there was a stage effect when Baby Soul was at the end. Lovelyz's concept goes well together!
=
Ryu Soo-jung Is not the moon goddess?
=
The stage is too short, so it's a shame. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Legends, but I'm crazy from the introduction.
=
It's like Kay Siren
But what happened to Ryu Sujeong vocal cord?
=
This is the all-time class on the stage of Lovelys Queendom.
=
It seems like something that expresses the dreams of Lovelyz uniquely.
=
Finally over
=
There are many different types of sexy, but this stage was very aware of costumes, sexy, no facial expressions, and all of the tones were my own.
=
I'll be listening to the cappella. The voice is pretty, but I'm good at cappella.
https://youtu.be/JRYO1MOH58w
=
How did you prepare for this stage? The best
=
Well, I've had a good distribution of parts.
=
Lovelyz is the best ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
I think Six Senses' biggest mistake was part distribution, but Moonlight was good at part distribution, good facial expression, and the song was as good as it always was.
=
This song video too!
=
Lee Soo-jung Yoo Ji-seo Lee Mi-joo Kim Ji-yeon Kim Myung-eun Ryu Soo-jeong
=
Did this song get criticized?
After listening to the final stage song, it's so good that it's good to sing next to this girl. This is a piece of rice cake.
=
Honestly, through the Queen, Lovelyz got to know better ... Each member knows what tone they have, and I'd like to see the flowers on a walk in the future.
=
The concept that was lost after coming out of the Queendom You're recovering a little here.
=
I don't know if I'm feeling it alone, but this song is like Jin's voice, Tiara Hyomin's voice, sincerely resembles the voice and overall vocal style is the same as Hyomin's
=
Wow, it's so pretty and Ryu Su-jeong's dyed wax cake is a legend ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Legend
=
Even in the early days of all kinds of bad guys and bad guys, it's great to have a good mentality and to do the cameo stage and the final stage.
=
The stage is really good and it's all good ㅠㅠㅠ To make it easier to see Rupy If the clothes of the dancer and Rubbish were different, it would have been better
=
Agat only Mi ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=
Lovelyz so good and this song, visual just so good
=
I don't like Lovelyz cute, but I like healing songs like Destiny.
=
Mask is an expression of contradictory mind that wants to leave the other person but at the same time wants to catch himself.
Throw me  Catch me and hold me tight
I'm already half way, I want to fly freely  be my own baby, be my baby
I'll find you again
"Now I don't know me," I'm confused, but finally "be my baby" ... ㅠㅠ
=
Ah, the song and the stage are legends ...?
=
After watching trials and trials and errors, cameo ㅡ final stage finally proved to be a group wearing clothes that fit like chameleons.
=
The stage was so good.
The kids are so pretty
=
One by one styling was so beautiful and like the Greek mythical goddesses dancing on the altar of the night.
=
I think I'm crazy too good ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Songs are good
=
벱 sol voice is cool
=
Lovelyz was the best
=
As Jane said, Lovelyz is a dance that releases her fingertips.
=
Really best
=
Moonlight stage is very good following cameo last week.
=
I sang so well that I listened to this song all week ... I'm so excited because I'm so sorry.
=
The song is really good
=
Moonlight song crazy
=
I gave you a lovely song from Lovelyz.
=
It's almost like I've seen it in Lovely's Queendom. I felt like this but the atmosphere looks so good
=
It's a legend in a lovely song !!!! ♡
=
Wow, Soul voice is really good. I want to keep listening. TT TT TT TT TT T TT TT
=
Ryu Soo Jung
=
Lovelyz It's good to come back with this song
=
It's a shame that you have to put a single toxin at dance break time.
=
Wow, you're so crazy.
=
I looked pretty like a celebrity
=
It's so good for sisters who want to love in cameo to find themselves by moonlight.
=
And Kagam and the sound directors, please reflect on it. Kagamdu ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ...
=
It was good if 2 seasons came out ♡♡
=
Good song

If you keep challenging, I will support Lovelyz moving forward step by step !! Good work
Lovelyz is doing well !!!
=
Lovelyz is the best ♡♡ # 1 in my heart ♡♡
=
Lovelyz This song is so good! I'm not going to be active with this song after the final stage.
=
Do what you want to do and believe you're harder in the process. Lovelyz Queendom Too hard and show me a lot of things from now on.
=
Baby Soul look ... how can I do something ... rather than chic ... I think it's firm.
=
But is M2 different? Do you have a Mnet and an M2?
=
I'm an Oh My Girl fan, and I'm surprised to see this stage. Especially JIN? The tone and facial expressions are so good.
Oh my girl and Lovelyz concept overlapped really tightly wrong. The original concept was different, but this Queendom seems to reveal the difference between the two groups! Lovelyz Cheer!
=
A potent group. Im so impressed. thank.
=
Wallpapers Sincerely, I thought about listening to the fantasy scenes and scenes made by the wallpaper.
=
I'm so happy literally crying for them !!! They all shines ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I've had a lot of parts this time, so good.
=
Hahahahahahah
=
The most lovely view of Queens
It is easy to see. I think there has been some growing pains so far in Queendom to make this stage.
=
The best real song is so good! Perfect performance
=
I think it's the best of the lovely songs.
=
It's America.
=
Baby Soul is so good. K is getting better.
=
From the stage, I think I made a song based on Lovelyz's opinion and choreographed it.
=
Lovelyz is the best for me. I've always been number one.
=
# 7 days after romance ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
This is how Lovelyz looks different
=
Is like Artemis
=
The performance is really cool. The change was amazing. But I didn't change much more than the idol group vocals, but the eyes are pleasant but the listening ears are boring. I wanted to be the biggest beneficiary of the quantum.
=
Oh my sister is a crazy one time.
=
I'm so good at the stage. It's the best ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The tone and the stage atmosphere are very hard
=
I'm crazy ...
=
This lovely music source I love dogs ㅠㅠㅠ my taste tt ㅠ ㅠ stage concept also the goddess of the moon Artemis feels so good
=
Real Ryu Soo-jeong's tone is so good ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ

I know all the kids' voices, but this song was difficult to distinguish. The first screen was really shocking, something creepy. Isn't it good? Lovelyz, the stage
=
Regarding the title, the costume is like Artemis.
=
I think I chose the song and the stage well
=
8 dancers in the moonlight
=
Good song
=
Korean ... Why don't you speak Korean
=
I'm thankful that this girl group is active.
Beautiful voices and beautiful music.
Not intense but addictive,
Purity feels afterglow rather than stimulation.
I hope you will hear good music in this way.
=
I modified it in Lovelyz and I like the K tone most, but this song seems to go well with him. I think I will attract randomly and fans will be satisfied. I think the atmosphere will be coming. I'd like to come back with this song. It's really good. !
=
Why don't you make a comeback for this song? I'm the first company I don't come back like you. I'm having a hard time trying to make another comeback.
=
It would've been better if I didn't get Kagam
Lovelyz to challenge is cool I love you
=
Like Lovelyz and fans as well, everybody was a professional, but it was a good experience. I hope you rest for a while
=
I had a hard time showing off a nice stage by appearing in the Amnet Survival Program that was only suitable for Toxic Lovelyz.
=
Ryu Sujeong is so pretty ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
While the crystal centered in the voice, all the other members were so good at it.
=
Real song awesome
Please give me a lot ...
=
Ryu Soo-jung, Oh, I'm crazy, Pew ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Ringing Please give me this solo song ... Give me ... ㅂㄷㅂㄷ
=
Thank you for intuitioning this stage of the stage ㅠㅠㅠ thank you for showing a wonderful stage every time! Lovelyz is the best
=
I like the song ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Citations
=
We've worked hard Lovelyz❤
=
This song is so good
=
I really worked hard. I lived as a Lovelyners and I really cheered and cheered up at school. My sisters worked hard, so I was proud of you with a burning heart.
=
Was it Baby Soul?
=
It looked beautiful in all generations during the Queendom stage. What Greek goddesses are. Yein and America knew they were pretty but they were surprised to see him. Personally unusual and good sound was Soul's voice. Soul came into every part of the ear and it was so good.
=
Eight moon goddesses ... I've caught two rabbits, a concept transformation and a Liz update.
=
Why can't you hear the bass like this? Get on your knees for the stage sound
=
It's better because you don't have a baby voice
=
Ryu Soo Jung is really amazing
=
It was a bit weak in the stage sound because of the intense feeling in the sound source.
=
Oh, this is an intro video Who reminds me of throwing bricks when infinite bad ... Please don't do that
=
How about red velvet, girlfriend, black pink, Chungha, showers on Queendom Dam?
=
Good job and lovely Lovely ^^
=
Whoever wants to do something lovely? This stage is so good.
=
Lovelyz looks very good on this image
=
This stage is a double crystal Carry. My sisters' skills are gradually UPGRADE,
Leeds update every time! The sooner you get Lovelyz, the better. ♡
I didn't have much confidence at first in Queendom and I tried to try a lot of new things but I didn't get directions. I'm so glad that I've done a lot of things and I've gained a lot of confidence. I am happy by this! I've been struggling to grow one by one and let's be happy in the future Because there are Lovelyners fans who support the hard-working Lovelyz!
Ipdeok stage recommendation: triangle / bells / now, we look at <<< cross editing ♡ !!
=
All groups that come out of the Queendom are winners.
Honestly, I only knew Park Bom, Mamamu, AOA, and kids, and I thought Lovelyz and O'My Girl were similar concept groups, but thanks to Queendom, I found both of them competent and attractive.
When the channel turns out to be a pure concept in the music program, it was either Lovelyz or Oh My Girl, and after the music, I separated the group name and the song, but now I know who it is.
=
Part distribution OK
Song Quality OK
OK
Choreography composition OK
Crystal Jin soul tone died in OK
=
You're a ... god.
=
It's so good and my sisters are so pretty and the concept is good and it's really good. Unfortunately, the last unit, too good as cameo
=
1:50 I lost my wing, and it was so fast when I called. Kay is literally a winged angel !!
=
Ryu Soojung is a master of all concepts .....
=
Refreshing Lovelyz Knowing that this concept is also digestible, the tsunami Lovelyz of the impression is possible.
Can you tell me what happened to the ranking by not watching the broadcast?
=
I will support you all the way to Lovelyz!
=
Eva is the stage ;;;;
I'm so crazy. I was crazy. I love you so much
=
The skills are on the stage.
Too good. It's a shame to see only me.
=
It's like a compliment, but all the comments that compare it turn around. All the words that are evil come back to me. If you come to me with comments like that Don't give up your personality All the groups, including Queen's Day Lovelyz, are all shining. I'm just a fan, not just a fan.
Please don't scratch the small gaps and cheer me up with the best things. I don't think there's any stage to be degrading.
=
It's good to have other members, but I also want to hear the chorus that Kay calls.
=
This song shouldn't be active but it's too wasteful
=
The other members were good, but it was so good that I could see the tone and the powerful treble of the Samsol!
=
I can't really catch the camera.
=
Now it's over. Let's fight for the activities in the future.
=
Hoi Lovelyz is really pretty lol
=
The song was really good and the tone went so well with the part distribution.
=
Myeongeun, I'm dying ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Jean short
=
Ryu Soo Jung
I love you
ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I think you did well with the Queendom stage.
=
Ryu Soo-jeong is so pretty.
=
The song is totally good ....! Lovelyz seems to be really great while playing Queendom ♡♡♡
=
Lovelyz I didn't know well Ryu Sujeong's sound was good when I saw it in the Queendom
=
I fly freely while doing what I want to do. Lovelyz.
=
The song is really good
=
I think of Artemis.
=
So good! Lovelyz please!
=
What's a Valka?
=
I love dogs for lovelyz
=
So good, so good
=
Good
=
I prepared a lot
=
I was very worried when I first went to Queendom, but of course I had some bad reactions when I was playing Queendom. It was great and it was so cool on stages ~~~ Lovelyz is the best for me ~~~ Good job ~~~ ♡ ♥ ♡ ♥ ♡ ♥ ♡ ♥
=
Wow .. it's an animation ending.
=
Finally lovely
Z can see a step ahead. Impressed
=
The song is good and good
=
I don't know if it feels like it, but the vocals are exceptionally loud.
=
Please don't make a baby sound, and the guidance is good enough on stage.
=
Lovelyz You've done so well, it's like a dancer under the moonlight, now the lyrics to find your self away from the love that's been holding you back reminds me of Artemis in Greek Roman mythology
You always know Lovelyz is number one for Lovelyners? I love you as always! I've been cheering for a few years, but I haven't had a moment that wasn't touching. So hard. ㅠㅠ (Oh, I'm getting balka. Can you see the choreography better in the preparation video?)
=
Honestly, one of the contests that have been shown in Queendom so far has been fine, one was a real star (images that don't fit with the oppression), and I think the two were good. I'm glad you're done well
=
I feel like I'm getting to know my group. I feel like I'm showing my skills at the end of Queendom.
=
It's a lot fresher and nicer to sing a song that isn't Haira like this song because Kay is unique like Oma's baby. The other song was Seung-jeon K.
=
It's cool, sisters ㅠㅠ ❤️ I'll always cheer while listening to infinite repeat
=
I'm not a fan, but it's very nice to see him grow up.
=
I'm sorry for the stage composition and storyline.
=
Do you know what are the three most precious golds in the world?
Right now with cash, deposits, and lovelys.
=
Ah, it's the best. Actually, I didn't have a cool voice.
Lovelyz, really good job ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's cool enough now, but I hope to be a growing group with this program
=
I couldn't resonate. I felt like watching Queendom, but I didn't spend much money compared to other agencies and made my first room arrangement strange.
=
This concept is so cool .... I hope the direction that Lovelyz wants to be respected from now on.
=
It wasn't your original voice. It's a good tone. Why did you have a baby voice?
=
Best in my standard Queendom
=
I was still worried about the stage, but I was worried about the stage.
When I opened the lid, I still boasted a stable and steady vocal line and added performance, so the lack was fulfilled, and the feelings of Lovelyz that calmly talked about sadness were so good.
I've struggled
=
2:46 ~ 3:03 Partly good Particularly 3:00 Elegant round elegance is so pretty ... A crane? equivalence
=
Haha I love the high-pitched parts
=
I talked a lot during the meeting with me, but the line is really pretty. TT TT I like the costume well. It's so harmonious with the fluttering lights. The vocals are really so good.
=
I'm crazy ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I know I like this song ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I love you ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Lovelyz is so good ㅠㅠ Concept is so good .. It fits so well .. Barefoot my sniper tangtang .. Come out with this concept next time .. I wish .. At first, Ryu Soojung went crazy at night when the dazzling moon rises. I feel like I'm in love. Lovelyz I don't know how many times I'm watching. I'll memorize the stage.
=
Wow. The song is so good.
=
Lovelyz worked so hard TT TT TT TT Whatever stage, Lovelyze is a lovely Moonlight so good. So good. I'm looking forward to the stage.
=
1:52 What are you doing here? God ... I'm really ecstatic.
=
So much steering
=
Artemis Lovelyz and Athena Oh My Girl
=
Lovelyz worked hard
Let's just walk the flower ❤
=
Much hard work !! ♡♡
=
It's too short ..... I'm sorry .. I can't send Queendom ........ Don't go.
=
Ryu Soojung's tone is so good.
=
It's good, but the Lovelyz costume was very neat.
=
Good song
=
Yes, the song itself is good ... But choreography What .. If you do not see the song is not in your ears ... The sound of the sound of the knife-kun you are a contest. It's good but the song is too much
=
Lovelyz Good job !!
=
Good song
=
Do you wear shoes?
=
Song Goodness Crystal is over
=
Did you follow the comments? What are you looking for?
Lovelyz was so annoying that I didn't want to admit it. The two groups are doing well, so don't let them fight.
=
Mr. Serge Sue's beautiful looks ... Wow.
=
Soul's voice is so powerful
=
I was waiting for the stage.
=
Why is it so lip-syncing in the beginning?
=
Yes, not just Six Senses
=
... ?? You're really good at singing. Why do you think there were no parts so far?
=
Vocal utilization has really developed. One at a time. Baby Soul shines in particular
=
I'm so good at this, but it's a waste to be criticized
=
Lol
=
It's a stage with Lovelyz. I hope you continue to come out with this concept. Just a little bit easier. Lyrics memorize well
=
Ryu Soo-jeong's tone is obviously cool. I'm good at singing ... I don't know much about Lovelyz songs, but I know that Ryu Soo-jeong played the introduction almost every time, but I think I know why.
=
Unfortunately, the song and the singer are so good, but there's no final impact.
=
Lovelyz This stage was so good !! Lovelyz feels good with the moon.
=
This song goes well with Jean Hussoll. Kay is also good at the main part, but I want to cover all three main vocals.
=
Where did you go to 30,000 people who commented at the 6th week?
Don't you want to see how good you are?
Moonlight, cameo video
It's still attached to the Six Senses video
=
It's like Artemis.
=
Ryu Soo Jung ... Artemis itself
=
So do you have someone to interpret what you mean?
=
Wow mysterious, like a ballerina cursed by the moonlight, and Kay's voice is crazy; As soon as Kay Hanpart came out, a spoonful of vagina, two tablespoons of mystery added.
=
Where did you follow Ohmy to mention Oh My? Don't let him make a fandom fight because he's not curious.
=
I'm sure this group can only work well now ...
=
I really cant get this song out of my heaaad but I hate how this is so underrated huwaaaah and theyre all so pretty too. LOVELYZ I love you!
=
If I don't get the one piece team song in the next album, will it be the title song of this style? ... I really think it's going to end well.
=
It's all good, but at the end, it would have been better if the humsol and crystal were more loud and fuller at the high end.
=
I did so well. I watched a video of Mnet KPOP's practice and it was so crying that I was trying.
=
It's so good
=
The vocalist is so good,
=
Thank you so much
=
Lovelyz
#To us_1and _lovelys
THANK YOU LOVELYZ
You girls did so well and good.
=
Real cubs get better as you go.
=
I'm so pretty.
=
Lovelyz best best lol
=
Soul Ryu Soo Jung ... Unseal properly ㅠㅠㅠ Okay
=
I love Lovelyz
=
Artemis Descendants Lovelyz❤
=
Fully Artemis Material
=
Ryu Soo Jung
=
The song and the concept are so good, but I think it would have been nice to go with the rap.
=
Okay
=
Today is the shortest stage, but I love the stage that showed more possibilities of Lovelyz❤️❤️
=
Good song
=
Lovelyz
=
Good song
=
What was this concept? I feel like Aphrodite is ruling the underworld ... I like singing.
=
I didn't like Lovelyz's innocent concept, but I think I'm wearing my appearance. There are a lot of fans who love innocence, but I hope it would have been nice.
Watch the dancing line again, Crystal's tone and baby soul ㅠㅠㅠ Why are you so good?
The members that I never thought of before also caught my eye and it was a very good stage.
=
The song was so good, but the expectations were too high.
=
I was a viewer, but I thought that the change that Lovelyz was showing in Queendom wasn't in touch with me (prejudice), but rather it didn't suit me, but after seeing the last stage of living, I felt that the attempt to change was the process for this stage. . It was so hard and the stage I showed was good.
=
I can show you more Lovelyz ..!
Was this the best? Or 1, 2
Did you give up and do what the gods wanted to do?
=
Wow ... this concept is the best one for Lovelyz
I think it's the best and best stage you've ever played in the Queendom stage.
Thank you so much for the last stage you've done a lot of hard work ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I'll support you in the future. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The song is good but the impact is weak ...
=
I felt like Cameo, but I want you to take care of Cody so that you can hang out with him more than ever. It's always a bit sad compared to other members ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Why do you push K?
Should Kay say sweet potatoes at high notes?
Baby Soul is terrible
=
Ehud Comments anyway ;;; There's a possibility I've come to you with all the swear words at Six Senses
=
My first place is Lovelyz, I love you
=
It was good when I listened to the sound source, but it was better to see it on stage and the direct cam was better. Lovelyz seems to have met a song that can compress and show their color.
In addition, I hope this Queendom will appeal to the star. As far as I know, Ringing is good at music, but it's more of a mass production style that the company directly manages, not a project type. But look at the overall result. There were some difficulties and bad results, but they expressed the colors of Lovelyz best and finally made the best stage. Especially, the last Moonlight seems to have melted Stahl's totals so far into the song. Ms. Star needs to consider this part carefully even for the youngest group. In that sense, I think that one of the teams that got the most through Queen's Kingdom was Lovelyz. I would like the care different from the conventional care.
=
JIN's mouth is amazing
=
The title is Moonlight, but it's like the goddesses of the sun ... I can be your slave.
=
When I start TT I go to TT and see, creepy, TT
Costume TT I saw TT breath TT blocked TT
=
It's a bit unfortunate because it's too much sound like the awards ceremony.
=
A MF LEGENDARY STAGE ㅠㅠㅠ IT IS FREAKING AMAZING IT'S LIKE A MIX OF 'DESTINY' AKA BESTEST TITLE TRACK AND 'NIGHT AND DAY' AKA THE MOST AMAZING B-SIDE TRACK EVER SOOO GOODDDDDD
=
U-stage so strong suction ..... The concept is pretty.
=
Lovelyz Good job.
=
I ripped off the stage ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Both coordination and voice fit together so well
=
It's creepy .... good
=
Only I like this song
=
I like singing so I'll come to see you with cameo.
=
Oh my god, I love singing so much ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
THE SONG IS CRAZY GOOD ㅠㅠ ㅜㅠㅠㅜ ㅠㅠㅜㅠ ㅠㅜㅠㅠ ㅜㅠㅠㅜ
=
Whoever said Lovelyz so well! I suffered a lot during Queendom and I want to see any stage that Lovelyz will show in the future ♥ I love you
=
Ryu's voice is so good ...
=
Ryu Soo Jung tone
=
Baby Soul vocals
=
I'm so good ...
=
The song is so good. I think it's because of the costume.
=
Lovelyz song was so good and I rip the stage and thank you so much
=
Thank you so much for preparing for 6 singers. So happy for a while.
=
Good job, whoever is the best, Lovelyz
=
Wow, it's really lovely tones. It's not like baby's voice.
=
I'm a lovely person who is good at new things as well as what I've done so far.
=
Lovelyz Good job Lovelyz is the best!
=
Happy to be a lovely fan ❣
=
Lovelyz
Let's be happy, Lovelyz
=
I'll see Lovelyz again .. Really.
=
Lovelyz had a hard time !!!
Really cool !!!
=
Overall, the song or the stage is good, but I feel a little lack of impact ㅠㅠ
The introduction was bright like a cameo, but if you did it in the second half, it would have been a stage where you could give a unique look and give a twist. Good stage!
=
Cody is the rope. I'd rather be coordinating the stage recently.
=
In the pre-competition, I left behind the sadness and finished with a wonderful stage. The song is so good and goes well with Lovelyz. Both strengths and weaknesses were opportunities to know well, so we will grow again. I look forward to the next stage.
=
Lovelyz.
=
Lovelyz in my mind already # 1 !!!!! ♥ Thank you so much for 3 months Queendom !!!!
=
I saw the stage of the goddesses !! Great dance
=
Lovelyz
Let's be happy, Lovelyz
=
Lovelyz
Let's be happy, Lovelyz
=
Lovelyz
Let's be happy, Lovelyz
=
Song Jeonju's completely my taste ㅠㅠㅠ
I don't like the chorus but it's so good
=
Let's get some views Oh !!
=
Lovelyz Queendom, you've worked hard, and I'll always support you.
Lovelyz song is really good, everything is so good ㅠㅠ Moonlight really good and I'll wait for comeback I'll be forever Lovely lovers ❣️
❣️Lee Soo Jung Ji Ji Soo Kim Ji-Joo Kim Ji-yeon Park Myung-eun Ryu Soo-jeong Elite ❣️Lovely sister (Love)
=
There is a desire to have a more dreamy atmosphere instead of a back dancer.
=
Singing good taste sniping continued to look at the Queendom Honestly, except for Lovelyz member K. I did not know the towing crystal imprinted, but the final costume is a bit unfortunate ...
=
Not only lovely but also looks great too!
=
I like the song
=
Lovelyz, thank you. Cheer up.
=
# 1 for us is Lovelyz
#Lovelys
=
I don't know if it's just me, but why do you look like the last six puzzle elite?
=
From the beginning of the revision sister Ryu Soojeong TT
=
Every time I come out, I can't concentrate because it's funny ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Not a lip sync ??
=
Choreographed feeling is very different.
Lupsunyi is the best.
I hope you have worked hard and take good care of your health so that you don't catch a cold.
=
I'm an FT fan, and by chance I got to know each one of the Lovelyz members through Queen Queen and found out that my voice, singing, and dancing are good. I took a hidden pearl group. Please continue to challenge songs of various genres. I'll cheer !!!!!
=
People don't know that they're bad → They will come back to you someday. I'm right with the boomer. I want you to think about it and act again.
=
I have a question. Why does JIN draw his tail up when he rips?
=
You're good, I'm the second place in my heart
=
Jiae-soo, who is always buzzing with her voice
=
The dishonor is all over me
Really good
=
Lovelyz still Number 1 in Lovelinus heart. Even they didn't won in Queendom at least they can show something new in Queendom. Thank you Lovelyz!
# 1 in my heart is lovely #
=
It was really good when I listened to music
Everything is so pretty.
The best. But personally, if the accompaniment came out more powerfully in the chorus, it would be a pity that the stage would be cool. Anyway, everyone was so good and best. Fortress
=
벱 Sol sister, I'm part-distributing guy Chaul-teok really ㅠㅠ ㅠㅜㅠㅠ I know you're singing well, but I'm upset because I feel buried in the songs of the roots so far.
=
ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's so perfect ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park Myung is really crazy with her short hair.
=
It's the best Lovelyz !! It's not final, but Lovelyz is the first place in Lovelyner's mind. Ayu Sujeong is so pretty.
=
The song is good. But the best thing is the stage equipment.
=
Really this song is so good Lovelyness is always first place in Lovelyus eyes! Myung is a single shot too pretty and big crystal, small crystal sister tone Too good the Americas, tow, Jisoo, Jiae, delayed sisters are all so perfect and Lovelyz is the best❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
Ryu Soo Jung atmosphere
=
The song is really good ...
=
# 1 in my mind
=
0:59 America's Arm Muscles
=
All my peers are in Lovelyz. ㅠ. ㅠ. ㅠ
=
Everybody's really pretty.
=
Finally, Baby Soul took the treble ㅠㅠ 벱 sol Next crystal treble goes well with the mood of the song Well distributed part ㅎㅎ
=
Good job
=
Lovelyz seems to show unique vain and innocence. It's a bright concept, but it's good because it's an oriental song.
=
Lovelyz, thank you. I'm the 1st person in my heart.
=
It's like a fairy that's going to be a myth. Now it's sexy for Lovelyz?
=
Lovely.
=
Everyone is like Artemis, the goddess of the moon.
=
LOVELYZ❤️Lee Jung Soo ❤️Lee Jung Soo ❤️Lee Jung Soo ❤️
=
I love you ~
=
Wow it's cool
=
Lovelyz had a lot of hardship ~~
=
It's good for Lovelyz, so many people are hungry.
When I look at the tedious kids, the answer came up ...
=
Really good
=
Good job Lovelyz!
=
Elite crazy or pretty
=
Lovelyz had a hard time !! Now rest and recharge and go on!
=
Lovelyz always cheers
Thanks for your work!!!
=
Is it always dull look at the 벱 sol costume? I can't dance so much.

I don't need it all
