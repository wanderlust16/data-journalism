I didn't know at first, but I felt the microphone squeaking
Mamamu Solar Flower Omgirl Mimi Seunghee I think you know there's a problem with the microphone.
Why amnet always like this? ^^
=
Test the microphone properly Mnet ;;
This is a wasteful stage for both the audience and the singer.
I need to show the right stage ㅠㅠ
=
But when the fire goes out, someone jumps out and changes the mic
=
It's too much lol. Mike eats one line of lyrics. If you just sing one of the microphones in the background
=
Whatever the microphone is, Park Bom's vocal chords are great, but the mics are so great. It's hard to find out where the mics came from.
Mike's first spring
=
Most of the time, they spent a lot of time and gathered the pinks and ses back to their old memories and performed concerts, but it was a legend that the people missed 2ne1.
=
I wondered if there was a problem with Park Bom's singing ability. Choir performance came. If Park Bom worked well, I would have been more moved.
=
It seems like Park Bom taps with a microphone finger.
=
1:54 Solar Expression Firm
2:18 loudness of speech
Both are seriously looking at me if I have to do this again.
=
I love Lovelyz
It's ridiculous that Lovelyz won Park Bom ...
Park Bom, it's more than that weird mic out there
=
You should care about the sound, not the broadcaster.
=
Head: huh? What's your microphone?
Hand: (talk) Microphone is strange
Vocal cord: I don't give in to that microphone
=
Every time I see you, it's too bad because of the microphone.
=
What are you looking at at this audience level ... You've seen and heard so far. Do you think you'll be cheated if you release it by editing
=
2:27 Mike TalkTalk Mike's problem is reconstructed.
=
Everyone in the bleachers would have been surprised to see the state of the microphone.
=
Oh, Mike, pick up where you really were and eat all your singers' songs.
=
Please provide the singer with the equipment
=
I don't know why most of the time I'm on stage in Park Bom, I'm never falling behind with my voice
=
I'll make sure to check the mic before the stage.
=
2:27 I'm touching Mike in this part.
=
Even though I'm a crap mic
=
It's cool that you've been singing so hard to the end despite the microphone problem.
=
I don't know anything else, but the person who puts Park Bom on the singer's ability is sul.
=
Are you crying when I'm alone on the stage?
=
It's amazing to live with Park Bom ...
=
Mike Why are you so crazy?
=
Oh my ...
My fav. Song from her. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It was a microphone problem. I'm dead.
=
How to make Park Bom Fever
Spring: You and I together it just feels alright
Lights off.
Dara, Minji: The word goodbye never
CHARLIN: I'll protect you no matter what anyone says
=
Park Bom There were a lot of accidents, but I didn't really die. It's creepy. I'm dying on the stage alone. And Mnet's heads gave Park Bom a broken microphone.
=
Uh ... you can always have it
=
There's no way around. Mike's problem is too bad, but when it comes to the microphone problem, it turns the screen into a reaction of the audience or singers, making spring seem to be a problem; I'm really living, so I hear that spring is not good enough.
=
I really love you. I love you TT TT TT
=
To be honest
Strange to star Park Bom
The queen and the little girls confront each other.
2ne1 was more than a real queen ...
(Park Bom Sister can be No. 1
Fighting!)
=
Mike too much
=
It's a microphone problem. I'm eating it.
=
It sounds like the voice is more mature and the pronunciation is more rolled rather than changed.
=
Oh my tears come out TT TT ㅠ TT TT Oh I really missed you so much
=
Wow, I think it's really great ㅠㅠㅠ I want to see more ㅠㅠㅠ ❤️❤️❤️
=
No, I'm not sure what bad microphone problem I'd rather know. I'd rather sing without a microphone.
=
Mike screened Park Bom ...
=
Is there a filter to choose Korean comments only?
=
2:26 I don't have a mic, so I beat my ear with my finger.
=
Park Bom, I sing very well. I'll cheer you up. cheer up
=
It's really like a junior high school student ... ㅠㅠ Really nostalgic song ㅠ Just the lyrics come out ㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom I didn't like it very much, but I've never thought of a funny situation where Mike can't do it well. Competition must be fair. I haven't thought that Park Bom couldn't sing as long as my debut year is old, and I think I prepared a lot by coming out solo. Would you be happy?
=
2:22 I can't wait to see you knocking in.
=
I love all the girl groups who appear here, but I honestly don't even watch the next episode.
=
I'll love you even if your hair is a skull
=
It sounds cool in the field, but why is it broadcasting? ㅠ Really one minute and one second was a creepy series so I just waited for the video
=
I feel sad because it's my throat and condition and Park Bom is doing such a stage. I always seemed to sing well.
=
I love this song so much .. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Mike really utters his voice.
=
2:27 Sounds like a microphone problem.
=
Usually the video comes out with a sound correction to listen to it better.
=
I still remember this video ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Everybody said they heard a song and they said they were crying
=
I really liked this song
=
Spring, thank you for letting me feel back to my school days, my tears are round, spring, thank you for singing again and courage
=
Wow, it's really nostalgic
=
The transmission is strange ... I never felt this way when I listened.
=
This song is really tearful ㅠㅠㅠ ..
=
If you're really good at this, you'll feel more thrilled.
=
Now I know why people shed tears at the singers in Totoga.
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I didn't think I'd hear this song again, but it was so salty and grateful.
=
2:35 microphone open heart
=
Hey, Mnet ... I think the other guys have noticed that the microphone was weird ... In the middle, Park Bom also pointed to the microphone and it was weird. I think ...
=
2:27 Park Bom sends a signal
=
02:27 Trash Mike Toktok
=
Wow, I really heard this song when I was in elementary school. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I'm already an adult .. Youtube Memories.
=
As soon as I came out, I cried
=
I really liked my dog ​​when I was choding, but I started tears from Jeonju ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I found out that Hwasa and Solar's facial expressions have a problem with the microphone.
Who brought Park Bom Kono's microphone?
=
2:28 I'm tapping my finger with a weird microphone
=
I'm trying to say that Mike doesn't work well at 2:27.
=
No, it's really Mnet. Mike's weird. I don't even notice it with subtitles and no articles. Decreased so many people)
=
2:34 Mike, what are you gonna do?
=
How about the microphone?
=
I want Park Bom to compete in that place ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's too bad Mike.
=
Obviously, Park Bom sings at once, but Mike's idiot no matter what.
=
What kind of MC microphone did you get from the music pro?
=
I'm so crazy
=
This song is already 10 years ago.
I liked listening to 2EN1 music at that time.
=
Mike was fine. It would have been a legend of Queendom.
=
2:35 This world-- no one
---------- It can't be replaced
Is this a real story?
What are we going to do with spring? You're responsible, Amnet pd.
=
I'll give you the microphone.
=
I've turned the microphone and I'm not coming out
=
Mike please .. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ TTTT ㅠㅠㅜㅠ ㅠㅜㅠㅠ
=
Mike Oh yes
Amnet please ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
This was a real dog chew song ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's a good dog even now ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Mike is so annoying.
=
2:52 Like this one
=
Your voice is so good.
=
Mike is so annoying, how pretty Park Bom's silence is.
=
Park Bom Bom was so cute and cute when it was a lollipop ...
=
Anyone in this world, Mike's King Anna
=
Okay, Amnet, you don't test when you give a microphone to a real singer?
=
Mike really ha ... I want to hear it properly
=
My chu
The protagonist Park Bom of a billion songs!
=
Park Bom's voice is not a substitute ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ In yg, I insist and prefer this vocal style. I can't follow this tone even if I bring someone lol
=
3:58 Who knows who
=
As soon as I'm done
=
Don't cry ~~
=
I didn't know if there was a problem with Mike.
=
QYoung x Holly bursts when I hear the intro part ... ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Ayu-chan is really
=
Real face is ruined ... ㅠㅠ
=
I'm crying even if I make a real jeonju ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ isse
=
Park Bom is the hit song
=
2:27 I just wanted to run out and change it.
=
I am more impressed by the idea that female singers would have grown up listening to and singing this song.
=
Huh ... Was there a microphone problem?
I didn't know that Park Bom was so good.
=
I don't know all about Park Bom and I apply it with my skills.
=
I don't want to admit it, but YG's song was really good at that time. Big Bang and 2NE1 are all lying together.
=
2:25 microphone tapping
=
If you really listen to this song
Lyrics and melodies are so touching
When you come out of Jeonju, Jin ㅉ ㅠㅠ ㅔ
=
Mnet work ㅡ ㅡ How to give a singer a microphone like that.
=
2:42 I think they both know there's a microphone problem.
=
2:28 Is it because the microphone is so strange?
=
We already saw Park Bom
Like the ashes that fall into memory while watching Totoga
It's too early to be a generation of memories and nostalgia ... I thought it would be forever when I was young.
=
It was one of the stages I really wanted to see again ...
I'm so sorry for the microphone.
=
Everyone's face hardened because of the microphone problem.
=
2ne1 perfection I really miss you once. Spring Sister Sister I did really well This is not the same Amnet or Amnet that gave me the microphone so even if you rank below, please cheer up ❤️
=
I really liked this song but it was so good to see !!
=
Please don't subtitle this sentence because Mic .. Mike is weird. People keep misunderstanding that Park Bom has a song .. ㅠㅠ At 2:27 minutes, You pointed out that you and I recently heard on Youtube. Please .. Everyone. I don't feel like you've come to me as soon as you can. ㅠㅠ Please let me know.
=
Listening to a real song
So nice
Memories are fresh
=
Do TT TT this TT TT TT TT TT Why TT TT TT TT TT TT TT
=
Park Bom I was worried that it would be burdensome by myself, but I already started the song selection ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The tone is really good
=
Is it possible to cover a micro like pine like that?
=
Wow, it was creepy to see this stage again.
=
I came right after seeing QYoung's fluency.
=
Goose ~~ Memories are fresh green and not rust
=
Anyway, there are many people who swear and suck
Certainly it's true that you can't see the stage even when you're standing alone on the big stage.
=
Bomb head long!
So pretty!
=
Tone bully
=
I really like it so much, but I'm really annoyed because the song keeps dropping because of the damn microphone. Besides that, Mnet always keeps turning the screen every time the microphone hangs up.
=
Verse 2? At that point, Mike, ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I really tears 2NE1 is the most special group in my heart ~ "Hello is never"
=
When I rehearsed, I'd test the microphone monitor.
=
You and I
Isn't it the last move? Lol
=
Mike, shit.
=
Mike or whatever, the song was so good.
=
Too bad and 2NE1.
Make sure you get together and make a great stage.
=
I was so grateful that I was able to hear this song again on the air, and it was so gritty and sober that I remember when it was just released. I felt it again
But it seems like Park bouncing on the microphone because it keeps dropping, so it's too bad, how bad was it that Mike keeps breaking up?
=
I came to hear today
=
While watching the Queendom stage, all of the stage sounds were so individual that I was very excited. But I sang so well that I could be immersed again soon
=
It seems like you've noticed that there's a microphone problem ... But Spring's sister's skills are ...
=
Mike is crazy .. complete jagged .. honestly, the singers also noticed a little from the expression, but Park Bom sent a sign ....
=
There are so many microphones. Why do you hold Park like that?
=
Tears. I haven't heard it in a long time, but when I saw the stage, my tears started crying !!
I will see you
=
Mike is so weird ...
=
ㅠㅠ The gold used in the activity of the uniwon or flashing green custom microphone Where is that? Job ㅠ ㅠ Mike status ㅇ
=
Tears in the eyes
=
Park Bom, I'm a real queen I'm just a queen
=
So good
=
I was worried that Owing's Mike was so bad.
=
Mike was weird, I thought it was hard for Park Bom after a long time.
=
Even though the appearance has changed a bit, the voices and emotions continue as before.
=
I'm singin 'when he's singing
Oh it's tight
=
Park Bom was the main vocal of 2NE1 who drew a idol series. There's a lot of meals here.
=
Now let's walk on the flower road ~~~~~ Spring ~~~~~~~~ ♥
=
I'm not a 2ne1 fan, but I know the sound is garbage. And I'm going to put in a singer reaction to sympathize, but I think it's better to put the reaction in moderation
=
Real Mike ... I screwed up the legend stage, didn't you test it in advance?
=
Park Bom Mack lol ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I've been struggling 2NE1 and I'm not good even if I try hard.
=
Is this moment so touching? (Really curious)
=
Get me a mnet microphone
=
Wow, it's really mic, but it's really crap.
=
2NE1 I miss you so much Park Bom I've seen an interview that it was really hard but I'm so glad to give you a good song and listen again
=
Did you pay for Mike Youngbie?
=
It was a microphone problem.
What am I?
=
Wow, when this song came out, I was an elementary school student.
=
The song I liked the most among the Park Bom songs ..... 2ne1 I miss you ....
=
The voice is really frustrating ... The song is good
Tight feeling;
=
If you hit Park Bom, you and i are crying alongside what you and i 2ne1
=
Mike ... why did you bring me that?
I'll let you sing.
=
Amnet really blows up ... what's Mike crazy?
=
Obviously, changed the appearance of Park Bom these days? As a fan who loved 2NE1 so much, I feel so grateful that if I listen to the Park Bom song that came back, I would like to thank you for coming back.
=
ㅠㅠ Mike's so foolish ㅠㅠ I keep hearing crackling ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Queendom someday 2ne1 I'd like to come out once ㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom's exertion is really ... how cool that song is ...
Do you breathe with your ears?
=
Every time I hear the microphone is too bad. I can't listen to this song.
=
I can't help but find a microphone at Kono.
=
Super awesome to make a low quality micro like that dog
=
Park Bom's two personal microphones are good
=
Park Bom is the one who really takes the stage by herself.
=
No. Is Parkbom here Bibil Beombab?
=
I love you
=
Mnet, please take care of the microphone. What is this?
=
The girl groups coming out here will probably listen to this song and raise the dreams of the singer and endure the trainee's life .. It's really creepy.
=
Bomi sister's challenge
=
Why the mic status?
=
It's too bad to see you again.
=
Respect my model
=
Park Bom is working hard but Mike seems to have a problem. Of course, Park Bom may have a problem, but 90% can say it's a microphone problem.
=
I miss you
=
I'm a little poor, but I'm singing this song for you today.
=
Tear tears
=
I'm floating because of the condition hunting and tension, but the live is a little unstable, the microphone problem is 80%. If you're really attracted to aggression, drag it straight and do it straight.
=
No, I wanted to hear Park Bom's perfect vocals, Mike Doratnya.
=
Too bad a talent.
=
2:20 2:34 2:40 3:57 I'm having a problem with the mic, but I turn the cameras to singers and fans.
I'll change it when it's dark.
. You indicate by hand that there is a problem in 2:27 ... so it is not controversial ;;
=
Park Bom is nervous as well
=
I was confused because of the choir.
=
Did you shed tears?
=
She was 2en1. Do you need words?
Everybody is a piece of creepy memory. Park Bom and this song are really creepy.
=
Who brought you Mike? Connomic
=
No matter how bad it sounds, it doesn't sound that way. 100per microphone problem
=
Why are you doing Mike? !!!
=
It's Mike's problem. You start verse 2. Anyway, there's a gesture that taps with the finger of a microphone.
=
2:11 Isn't it pink hair?
=
Did you buy it from Mike Daiso?
=
I'm not good at Mike. Mnet ...
=
Park Bom Mike is weird.
=
For some reason, 2NE1 members seem to be crying
=
From the touch of a microphone, Park Bom keeps popping because the microphone doesn't come out properly
I can't see Mike tasted like that.
I'll give you the right microphone
What are you doing? ;;;;
=
It's a highlight right before the cancer.
=
Why do these tears come to me? It's like a song to fans waiting for a long gap.
=
Even if you listen to Jeonju
=
Does Mnet not really work? Can't you test the microphone properly? Should you only think about your bowl? What's wrong with that? He's already queen and you can't trample it.
=
I thought it was because I was breathing in the park, but I was really lamented to see why Mike was tapping Mike in the middle.
=
It's because of the mic chewing the lyrics every time.
=
I first heard Jeonju
I can't really say it.
=
Really; I heard only Jeonju and creepy and thrilled.
=
Let's care about the real sound. Why?
=
This sister's voice is a real national treasure.
Give me that microphone ㅡ ㅡ
=
Eo ~
=
I didn't know that spring would listen to this song live again. Thank you so much and thank you again. Thank you so much.
=
Bom ... why did your face go like that ... ㅠㅠ Too bad ...
=
Mike doesn't come in and keep on tapping ...
=
Good spring
=
Park Bom I don't know anything else but I'm not good at singing
=
I don't know if Mike's broken, I thought I was going to cry out with emotions.
=
Despite the bad microphone, the sound and the song are so good
=
I was just a singer in the idol when I was rated as an idol and an artist
=
Why why why ~ !! Is Parkbom the last? Better than Mamamu ~ !!
=
There was definitely a problem with the microphone. If you didn't fix it at the time of the rehearsal, it's likely that Mnet didn't take any action on the sound side.
=
I authenticated live because of a microphone issue.
=
I also heard from a two-year army.
=
I'll go see them when I perform 2NE1 at the Olympic Park ... Can you come back?
(Reviewing the performance of 2NE1 collection in KT)
=
Where are you going?
That stage grasping power !!!
=
What is M.net?
Disappointment
As an older person
The microphone is on stage
Not the 80's
=
The world .. I was good at John Burber.
=
Park Bom is not good at live ,, 1:24 Look here, it's a problem with Mike even if you make a cancer ,, ;;;; The other part is that Park Bom is so good at live that you don't feel like you can't live
=
It is not a problem of Park Bom's ability, but a performer who does not fit the program format. No matter how old and solo Park Bom sings like crazy, it's hard to be number one. Season 2 If you're going to do it, take a solo.
=
When I came out that song was at the end of my teens
=
I first knew it was a good two-one song.
=
Mike's worse than spoon beetle.
Rather, I'm ruining the microphone
=
Listening to Ao TV is also a microphone;
=
Are you messing with Mnet Mike? !!!
=
This is Mike's problem. Spring hits Mike in about 2-26 seconds. TT TT Mnet What are you doing? I'm ruining this masterpiece
=
I frown and tears come
=
I'm signaling that something is wrong with my microphone at 25 minutes.
=
Why are you going to tears?
=
It's good for Mike to be controversial, and it's better for him than Mike. Please
=
My voice is so unusual. Even with my eyes closed, this is Park Bom.
=
Dogs aren't working Mnet ??? Why did you do Mike? ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Ugh Creepy
=
I have a breath, but if I have an ear, I'm hanging up while I'm listening. That's the microphone.
=
Mike can't make a sound.
=
Sound Processing Park Bom-man Why is it so bad? Why do you think it's pressed in the middle?
=
Mic
=
After all pro is tough even if equipment is garbage
=
Thank you for singing and thank you for calling me. The sound is so bad that I couldn't put Park Bom next time, if you care about the acoustics. He is a great singer.
=
Something's getting louder and louder ... Is there a microphone problem?
=
I'm upset
=
Don't you check the microphone status before starting? Is it a contest? I was so upset than I really watched that I played Youtube;
=
In my ear, I think I bought a 1000 won yellow microphone at a stationery store and wrapped it with black confetti and made it like a real microphone.
=
Park ᆢ
=
Being alone on stage is a castle
=
I don't have a microphone.
=
The juniors who came out there weren't competitions, but they were really cool seniors.
=
Mnet doesn't know anything. Oh there's one
=
Spring is not too hard, and when you're on stage and you're a little comfortable, you're qualified enough to be a university professor.
=
Ignoring the microphone problem, the vocals are great.
In many idol groups, the solo figure looks so lonely.
2NE1 members will miss you.
=
Mike broke and forced live certified Mnet guys do it straight
=
Park Bom is Park Bom too!
=
What happened to your face
=
Real Park Bom you and i .. I like the song, but Park Bom sings because it's famous .. Big ㅠ Fresh spring Please give me a really good song.
=
Really Park Bom is Park Bom
I think of 2NE1.
=
No, I can't see the solar face and the audience shots and songs.
=
Spring, cheer up, always cheer up ~
=
Park Bom Fighting 2 Anyone was so good at that time
=
And low micro volume
=
Mike who went ;;;;
=
I heard somehow frustrating ... The sound keeps on eating, if the microphone is weird in the contest .... ㅋㅋㅋ ......
=
Park Bom I want to comb my hair behind my ears
=
Why are you crying? I want to go back to the time this song came out ...
=
Earrings and hair
=
I don't think Mike is bad.
I keep hanging up
=
No Mnet work ??? Park Bom gave me a sign that it's a microphone problem, but I'll change it a little late.
=
Amnet ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; I was really crazy if you were me. I prepared really hard.
=
Is it really Tuenny One? Anyway, I don't know why, but I'm so sad even though I was born in 2006.
=
How much better should you call 5th for Park Bom?
=
I wasn't the only one who would cry
I don't know why,
Listening to the song in the spring makes me feel dim and dull.
Feel back to back then ...
=
I think I've prepared a lot. Can't even get a Mnet microphone straight? I cut off the sound.
=
No, it looks like there's a problem with the microphone, but Mnet Schwarm just ignores it.
=
I talked about the microphone problem or ability problem. Park Bom I searched on YouTube immediately and I watched the most recent 3 weeks ago (1 week ago).
=
No Mike true? Do you keep using that when you sing Park Bom? I miss you, but I can't see you because of Amnet.
=
Mike Why
=
When I was young, I was going to Seoul and I was wondering what song I came out of the car.
=
2:27 Is that a choreographer here? Or is it a sign that Mike is weird ... ??
=
There's a song contest and legends. Amnet dogs, what do you bring the mics to the mic?
=
beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
It's great. People react. I'm already drowned in memories.
=
I'm not sure I'm a man ... I have dark eye makeup ...
=
Sounds like there's a sound problem. I'd like to listen to the music and actually listen to it.
=
But what did Park Bom do? Is it due to pharyngitis or too swollen? My skills are still there.
=
Park Bom looks a bit breathtaking, but the microphone is just hanging up ...
=
Why Mike ?; If you see, I can't sing.
=
Did you get Mike?
=
Get some amnet mics
=
Mike, I'm hungry.
=
Why is this song crying just by listening to Jeonju? Is it because I remembered that time?
=
Park Bom is a talented person
I'm tears this stage
I've been through a lot of difficult things before, but please cheer up and keep listening to that beautiful voice.
=
Looks like you're signaling me to check out the microphone at 2:26.
=
It's hard to believe, but it came out
It's a song when all the idols were minors
=
Return to elementary school student
=
Even though the microphone state is this
=
Park Bom's face is so wasteful
=
Now I know a lot about the mic signal. If you think about writing more than a microphone from the day you went out of TV -_- ;;; It was hard
=
Zaraheo
=
What's the sound team?
=
Mike why? Ajinsim Mnet was too
=
I listened to the song and cut off the part that I was going to breathe. I was just breathing or taking a rest .. Mike's problem ... !! ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I was so happy that the memories of singing with my friends in karaoke ...
=
I feel that the microphone is strange; I feel like it sounds good, couldn't the crew feel it?
=
I will cry
=
Park Bom Go !!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
1:04 Gingshihun ProduceX101?
=
2ne1 miss
=
Did you call it that way? crazy..
=
If you look at the screen, you'll see Mr. Patty Kim's immortal masterpiece.
=
I didn't like this program but I wanted to listen to Park Bom's song.
=
Honestly, you have to come out with Park Bom and CL;
=
It's too late for the microphone to be out of sound and it's too late.
=
If you pulled out the broken micro, you would have come out with a much higher quality stage, but Gaemnets ruined the return.
=
I think it's going to tears
=
I don't watch mics because I'm Mike.
=
I cut you off because of the microphone at the part. It tastes like the microphone at the high end and it gets smaller and bigger. It's not Park Bom's problem.
=
Bring me a new one, niggas stations.
=
I think I'm going to win first. Yeonson students have no choice but to sing this song. This song influenced their lives.
=
You are my spring
=
Does it make sense to be close to Park's ability as people say? Live really
=
Mike Why do you even think you're having a problem with tapping the microphone in the middle?
=
...? I don't think the microphone is bad. TT Incredibly ... So, Park Bom's song was very touching and good .. But even though you're one person, it's too hard to do it up to the microphone, but take a breath .. But you did so well .. !! ❤
=
I got something like Mike
=
I'm just thinking Amnet is deliberately trying to cause a controversy over Park Bom;
=
Rather than Park Bom's ability or something, I'm sad because it reminds me of when I listened to that song
=
good
=
Amnet is still there.
=
Even if YG didn't happen, Park Bom isn't going to come out there.
How the rest of the boys rub
=
It's like you put your hands in the back and adjust it.
=
I'm a singer in spring, but I'm a weird singer. I know all the singers in the waiting room, and everyone knows, but please go straight to the Queen's Microphone.
=
If it doesn't work, I'll replace it with the choir Mike when the light goes out, or the staff will pop out and change it. What's that Park Bom?
=
Do you call this a song?
?
=
Looks like a medic likes people.
=
Mike Why do you care about it, the voice is too loud and the treble is interrupted, so I can hear it like it's loud and even more. I will support you
=
When I finish the song and get off the microphone, I'm scared but supportive What skills do I have?
It's hard to cut and call on purpose.
=
2NE1 I don't get tired even if I keep listening to the present, I just want to see you before I die. It's more because it's the only group
Aside from the male and female group, 2NE1 group was the only one
=
https://youtu.be/-pPgHX_cfGY?t=44
44 seconds and 1 minute and 9 seconds, if you have a problem with the sound part, you tap with your fingers;
Mike is right
Did you know if Mnet didn't check it?
=
It's salty ... The condition doesn't look like the old spring.
=
Honestly, this is too much of a microphone.
=
If you sing in a real karaoke song
No parts to breathe, the sound is high and scary
... Park Bom is great
=
A few years ago, when I sang that song, I was with 2NE1, but now I sing alone
=
1st place for 5th place.
=
Doing what we want to fly more on stage in spring ~
=
Awesome
=
1:51 It's like Mike noticed it.
It seems that Sola know Bom ’s mic is bad.
=
2:26 Mike's steps aren't really adjustable
=
2:26 I'm knocking in and mic ... Amnet.
=
If you give a singer a handicap as a microphone
=
Mike isn't crazy?
=
The first measure 'you' was creepy ... I really liked the song when it was released and I still hear it
=
In 2:27, you tap twice with a microphone finger, but that's a problem.
If the singer makes a gesture with the microphone, he will know better than anyone that he might hear it .. ㅠㅠ
I don't want to be treated as older. 걍 Give me the basics ..
Idol from my elementary school age
=
Honestly, the voice is legend .. YG This is how the original method is supported.
=
Oh, I don't do it straight.
=
You're fat and have a lot of self-esteem. You're too nervous. Mike is nervous.
=
Why did the sound break up, but the microphone was the problem ...
=
Why is it because my voice feels frustrating like I'm calling? I was having a problem with the microphone
=
The microphone is weird.
=
I'm sorry for all of my spring sisters.
=
Park Bom is a beevil with these guys
=
I'm glad to see Park Bom singing this song again in 2019
=
Park Bom is legend. Park Bom Tone, Chang Sok 2NE1TV's personality was the way people followed the style of eating. There was no unique originality of Park Bom.
=
I think there was a problem with the microphone. The song was cut off and heard small and loud and repeated ...
=
Don't show me a reaction in the middle
=
Honestly, Park Bom expressed all things with this song
=
This is why people use melon.
=
Park Bom
=
Can't someone tell me it's not a spring problem in English and a microphone problem? Foreigners are hard to sing Park Bom because Park Bom wanted to cry. Please tell me that Amnet is like Mike
=
Solo seems to be disadvantaged compared to the group .. However, compared to other groups, there is little stage change and it seems to have received a lot below except for being a senior.
=
Mike No Why why are you so crazy?
=
I feel great when Park Bom fills the stage alone, but it looks empty but I call it full.
=
2:27 I have a problem. Spring is a professional.
=
Mike ant
=
The best stage Queen Queen has built
=
Let's go creepy out
=
Park Spring Tone, don't spoil your singing powers;
=
Park Bom Fighting !!
=
Woww it's incredible performance awesome
=
Sumnel Hong Jin-young Inline
=
I'm really cool. I will always support you, whatever you choose. I love you.
=
Mike ruined this stage ...
=
Spring is my sister .....
=
Mike gave me a real beggar.
=
The waiting room size difference is so great,
=
Oh, 10th anniversary of this song.
The days of Leeds have passed
Class is forever
2NE1 The best girl group of the time
=
I put it in the iriver mp3 during the midding and I listened to it all day long.
=
Mike's eating all of his voice, so his nose is eating ...
=
Mike true? Look at the break, Park Bom is calling me wrong,
=
I was really looking forward to the stage and I heard something out of the ordinary, so I listened to my earphones again. Why did I not call it? I'm annoyed when I go to a karaoke room and meet a microphone, but I'm so upset if the singer is interrupted by a microphone on the stage.
=
Are you the real idol of idols?
=
Park Bom Singing I wanted to go to karaoke This is a masterpiece that reminds me of school days
=
2NE1 would have been amazing
=
It's not Mnet, it's Amnet. Mike's weird, I noticed and mentioned the other groups in the waiting room.
2:39 Solar expression hardened and 2:42 Mimi's weird face makes me notice everything
Mnet is so vindictive ... The other groups in the waiting room must ve noticed that sth was wrong with bom ’s mic and probably mentioned it b
ut Mnet edited all out
u can see from solar ’s expression at 2:39 and mimi ’s expression at 2:42
=
Park Bom is a legend
=
I'm giving my finger a sign saying there's a microphone problem.
=
Mike's insane. What a trot break you're at.
=
Park Bom Singing Mike is busy
Give me a good night
=
Was the concert hosted by IBK a charmon? Anyway, but there was a spring sister there. I think it's done, but Spring's skills aren't dead yet ... because of Mike.
=
It's so bad, it's a song, it's so good, it's a voice, it's so good
=
Creepy TT
=
My sister wants to do what she really wants,
=
ㅋㅋㅋ Most of the idols
I would have listened to that song and spent my school days.
=
I feel like I'm crying
=
Tears, spring must be happy ㅠㅠ ㅠ When I was young, I was comforted and listened to every day, but now I am a big adult.
And Mnet did Mnet again. Is there really any sound garbage?
=
I shed tears
=
2:27 I think it's a gesture more than a microphone.
=
I'm going to tears.
=
When I was in school, I was singing karaoke.
=
From the accompaniment to crying
=
2ne1 best ~~
=
It's controversial for Park Bom.
=
My neck feels worse than before.
=
I'm going to tears ...
=
Oh, it's an important spring stage. Mike's a problem.
=
Oh
=
No. I thought it was a special show because I was a Park Bom judge.
=
My ears were happy at this time
=
Stage Start 0:48
=
I heard this song when it was hard. Park Bom fighting once more with the lock version
=
I feel like I found a sticker photo taken 10 years ago that I thought was lost.
=
Someone told me it was a real inear and a mic in two minutes and 26 seconds. His neck wasn't the best, but he had a good sound.
=
Oh, why are you in tears ... I think Park Bom endured tears ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Thank you
=
It's a song with lots of memories in my childhood
=
Cool good good
=
I wish I could see 2ne1 through Queendom.
It's really hard to listen to this song when it's really hard
2ne1 hua tt
=
I feel sorry for spring
=
Personally, I was a 2NE1 fan and listened to this song a lot, but this stage sounded especially hard to sing.
=
Is it really Mike's true story? LOL doesn't make sense
=
3:28 Both the audience and the singer seemed to have returned to their old days. I'm so impressed.
=
3:05 Look at Seunghee.
=
Bom ~ The best!
=
Why are you crying?
=
What's Mike ?!
=
I saw it on the stage of Park Bom, but it was not only me, but the other singers also did it ..!
=
I'm angry. My favorite song is Mike.
=
You sing really well even when Mike is in trouble.
(Please pay more attention to Mnet)
=
Hey Mike
=
And I'm crazy tears;
=
Park Bom, your voice is like a treasure jewel.
=
Wow ... Jeonju is just a moment of creeping out.
=
What is Mark?
=
Mike Boo's shit, but Park Bom is so great. I would have tried to make a good sound and sympathize with anyone who sings.
=
I'll just let you sing Park Park all the time.
=
Wow, it's tears
=
Mike's ... Even if you're not interested in music, Mike's a problem.
=
But I wonder if this is a girl group confrontation. Park Bom was a girl group in the past, but now she's acting as a solo group. I want to ask pd
=
It would be a creepy dog ​​behind Sandara Park
=
I'm sorry for the weird microphone.
=
Are you messing with Mnet?
=
I don't have a good microphone, so I'm bringing my personal microphone first.
=
i cried when her sing this song, love you bom ㅠ
=
Park Bom sister ㅠㅠ Long hair and black hair and red hair I want to see you ㅠㅠ I want to see again ㅠㅠ I just walk the flower road❤❤
=
It's a real memory but it's so good ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I really want to see it ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ https://m.media.daum.net/m/entertain/poll/10747
=
That song of real memories ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Too good
=
Myeongbul Haeon ... !!!!
=
The song is scary and good but Mike is coming out ...
I even pointed it out ... but it's ok. ♡
=
Mnet ... Mike ...
=
Tears are falling, but spring is so precious.
=
When I was in elementary school, I used to be dogs.
Where is the sound of the kitchen? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No ... Park Bom, Mike, why are you doing this? ;;
=
Stop your face, I hope you come back to your old face
=
I don't take a break in the middle, but it's because of the microphone. What did you do? Mnet ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I don't lose my expectations.
=
Too rough rock ......
=
Wow, real plastic surgery should never be addicted.
=
Microphonesome;
=
Microphone;
=
The tone is a little different
=
Queen queen queen queen queen
=
The microphone is smaller than Park Bom's
=
My face looks pretty at first
=
Park Bom is one of the victims of YG. Yang Sae's continued expression of low self-esteem and the choice he made was a plastic surgery. It wasn't so good that the rumors became true (actually, the drug Park Bom was taking as an antidepressant drug in the United States, and delivered to the maternal grandmother's house, was later found to be false.) The antidepressant has a narcotic substance, but the actual narcotic substance was 0.6%.) The rearrangement and comeback, the bad guys .. Park Bom is one of the victims of YG.
=
Park Bom I don't feel bad or have a microphone problem. This song is really nostalgic. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Crazy ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Like Mike's eating sound
=
ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I've taken another legend stage, but I feel sick because my throat is not the same as before
=
How do you beat 2NE1?
=
2:26 It's a familiar song, but why did you want it to sound so strange that you had a problem with the microphone? I'm sorry ㅠㅠ
=
Real Park Bom's voice seems to ring. Perfume seems to be right
=
Are you the only one with the microphone that sounds weird?
=
Mike's so copious. Not just Park Bom, but Mamamu keeps dropping.
=
Everyone mentions the microphone problem, but if there is no microphone problem, the caller will be embarrassed.
=
Oh why are you doing this ???????
=
Park Bom, 10 years old, feels sick because he feels like he is starting from the beginning among juniors.
=
Mike, why are you so crazy?
=
What is your face? No shower
=
Park Boon ❤️
I always cheer for spring day
=
0:46 Me genius ...?
=
It's really pretty, spring!
=
❤❤️❤️
=
If only sign language was added to this stage, it was legend.
=
Park Bom, humanly singing, you're not good
=
I'm sorry about the microphone. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Mike is weird
=
Eat only corn and don't eat anything that's bad for you
=
Staccato or mute
=
The song I listened to 1000 times when I listened to a real electronic dictionary.
=
Why didn't you put something in there? Korean became Russian
=
It would have been better if it was a stand microphone
=
I can't sing because of the microphone
=
Look carefully if you grow older
=
Mike? I don't think it's a problem.
=
Miss you...........
=
Korea's real haha ​​I'm getting water ㅋㅋ Foreigners' comments are different
Korea is one, only about Mike ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅅㅂ
=
Park Bom is a gangster
Are you anxious to see
=
I shouted from the first measure
=
I love you spring ❤️ I hope you don't have to be good at it, I hope you're always the best Park Bom I'm not alone I'm always alone Thank you for singing with me forever ❤️❤️
=
If you put something in your face
=
The last part came from tears .. The song I sang all the time in karaoke .. Thank you
=
There's a group that won 2ne1 by hit song confrontation among female idols ... I really miss you.
+ By the way, Mike can't hear all the sound, so I can't hear that much;
2:26 Maybe Park changed the microphone when it gave a signal to the microphone?
=
Mulberry
=
Beholder
=
Push the trash mic into his voice.
=
I love you guys
=
Please recently you and I want to hear everyone ㅠㅠ If you do better, you never do that sound! I sing well in spring and use it very well Oh, my tears are falling
=
I love the song too.
=
I have to focus on the song ...
The lyrics pass with Park Bom's life
Cheer up spring
=
So good
=
Depression ... Why so sad! I'm in my 20s legend idol
=
How hard it is to listen to UN's children, but do you have good sound control? ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Mike is so sorry but we never forget
I always support you and love you Park Bom
=
Ha ..... Park Bom ...
=
If you have a bad microphone
=
Mike keeps dropping when I came to the waiting room after the show.
=
The microphone is just too bad to hear ㅡ ㅡ
=
But what is the difference between the waiting rooms?
=
I would like Tiara to come out.
=
Even if you're alone, you're so impressed and the stage feels so full
=
Park Bom Wasn't there a drug debate before? It's been a little uncomfortable since then ...
=
Is there a problem with the microphone?
=
Mike's garbage;
=
It's true that Park Bom is full of charisma.
=
I signed for Mike's not coming.
=
My voice is good, but I feel like my face has changed
=
Ah ... I feel sorry for Park Bom.
=
It's been a while since I've been on stage, how impressed it is when the audience sings together .....
=
Sound is the best? I was upset because I wasn't really funny.
Where do you dare to broadcast the Park Bom Legend stage where you dare to pay? It's annoying ...
If you're a bad lad, fall a little; If you don't know the value, don't be fooled.
=
Is there a lot of comments that it's hard to sing Park Bok-song here? I remember when I sang during the heyday of Park Bom. Originally, it wasn't such a voice and voice, but it's because Yang Hyun-suk had to sing it singly since he was a trainee.
=
2:26 I'm knocking on the microphone. Sounds really bad.
=
The microphone doesn't work properly.
=
I'm so impressed to hear a song that never seemed to be heard again in my life.
=
The Park Bom song is unstable and dangerous when I see it, but it seems to be whistling and I never fall and continue to feel it.
=
Park Bom, who fills the stage as a solo, is a moral book ....
=
It's a pity that the sound quality of microphone is a little bad.
=
The sound is so strange Spring won't make this perfect
=
Why are foreigners?
=
It's Mnet Amnet. Don't you just deliver the microphone properly?
=
As bad as song lyrics ...
=
I think I'll be tearing down TT
=
For me this is number one.
=
Wow, I was really creepy looking at it.
=
I can see that there's a problem with the microphone.
=
I don't think I'm good at it, so I think it 's a live performance. ㅠㅠ other teams have strong Perfora?
=
Park spring children popstar cover good wishes down down down
=
It's not a bowl here.
=
Msg consistently
=
Sound is weird, is the microphone a problem ???
=
Creepy
=
Other singers soon did well to blame the sound
=
Mike is weird ... Park Bom knocked Mike in the middle
=
I can't say that I have good skills, but I think there are generational differences.
=
Honestly, I don't know the song .. I still don't know .. The voice is still good. By the way, I've already changed my face.
=
My legs are still pretty
=
I'm good at singing, but stop molding.
You can't break any more here.
=
A lot of fellow singers say a lot of good things to the viewer.
=
Why are you crying?
=
I hate music like this
The moment the melody comes out and the good song comes out, the atmosphere forgives everything
The music is so dead
=
LOL LOL
=
The mic is so powerful that it can't hold everything.
=
Our time diva
=
It looks like Park Bom signed the sound director that he had a microphone problem. Mike banging scene 2:27
=
I'm listening to a song I've heard at an age I know so much I'm listening to live again
=
Big ... look at the voices.
=
What happened to Seolhyun? Face is ...
=
Mike is also a microphone, but always comes out with a unique tone, but his song is full of songs. The sound source is crazy, but when I live, I always missed something .. Not just this stage.
=
It's spring or it's not looking.
=
I'm only looking forward because of schedule or agency problems .. At last, Chorus is divided into three teams.
=
Are you kidding Mike
=
Why are you Mike?
=
Park Bom can't sing, but it's a microphone problem. At about 2:28, Park Bom touched his finger that the microphone was weird. Park Bom knew that there was a microphone problem.
=
I'll do it first as a Lonely Lonely.
=
Please take care of Mike.
=
I thought I couldn't sing because I had a problem with Mike;
=
I actually liked this stage whatever the microphone
=
2NE1 seems to have become the sore finger of everybody until the day when I can see the whole body
=
Park Bom ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I really missed you so much
=
I think it would be pretty if only the lip filler is melted on the face
=
I love you Park !!!!> <
Let's walk only flower road!
=
There's a microphone problem. The singer touched the microphone directly.
=
I came to know you were Queen you and i
=
What's Mnet Mike?
=
It's not an acoustic problem, but people who don't know Park Bom are looking at this once
No it's a microphone problem.
https://youtu.be/vHCpGGbm0Zs
=
Pitch, Nabal, and no microphone? What does M net work for? It's like the microphone is so cold
=
It's too bad in many ways.
=
But Mike is really serious ??
=
Why are you doing that?
=
Considering the microphone, it's an old song. I think it's a bit different because it's a little different in pronunciation and breathing position.
=
No. So was the sound only at night?
=
Mike, are you kidding me?
=
Breathing run ?? I breathe while listening ;;
=
Oh Seung-hee
=
It's a prom, but I think spring is different ... I'm different ...?
=
ㄹㅇ Park Bom is not a weak live, but Mike is like that .. What ruined the live. Spring sister has been a favorite singer since ancient times.
=
Isn't Park Bom signaling at 2:27 that the finger tapping the microphone is a problem?
=
I thought only I was in tears, but people are so frustrated
=
I spent springtime watching my sister in elementary school, and I slept while listening to my sister's song. Thank you for singing and singing again. I was tears watching the video, but I think it's not a sadness but a tear of joy. My sister's health is ahead of others, so I hope you're always happy. It's a long-time fan's wish. I love you.
=
The singer who let me know that tears can come from listening to the song. Before I listen, "I miss 2NE1."
=
2ne1 is a legend I can't follow any girl group
=
2:27 Mike, it's weird.
=
It was good that it was just a song without a performance
=
I think it's not going to be 1st place even though 2NE1 is gathered;
=
Looks like the melody and the lyrics are there
=
No, can't you just make a song when you sing?
=
It's like a school festival microphone.
=
I think Mike's eating, but it's because of the mood.
=
This song is really difficult.
It's so hard to sing so attractively in live music. There is a microphone breakup.
Park Bom sends two signals to the crew, one with an in-ear and the second with a microphone.
But I keep getting disconnected until the end
I hope you listen to that
Park Bom fighting!
=
If the sound was perfect, I would have felt more hungry
=
Park Bom is like a doll
=
Mike, why are you doing that?
=
Isn't this live? Why are you doing that despite Mike's problem? Amnet doesn't have an answer Bom sings and there's no CL to rap next to me This is ridiculous
=
That's the real tone ... That's what Yang Hyun Suk wanted to have along with the trainees to die. So, the WY girl group sound is similar to that.
=
Honestly, if you cheetah in the spring, it's not a contest but a stage for celebration ;;; It's strange to be here
=
When someone staged
Cheetah Friends Park Bom
Jimin with a cheetah
I was so funny because I learned rap from cheetahs.
=
Why nobody talks about cody ㅠㅠ Cody is so pretty I will be your faithful dog.
=
Can you make a fair evaluation in the first place? Isn't it too natural that Park Bom is being pushed by a fandom number?
=
Jeon So-yeon will be amazing.
The teacher who once taught me
Now the cheetah sings my song.
=
But Park Bom's annoying sound is so bad. All the other groups are mr, and the part is lip-synced, but Park Bom is so overwhelmed to live the group song alone. Of course then
It's a trap
=
Can't you joke with Ciel or Sandarabak once?
I'll stand in front of the TV and watch it 108 times
=
The main audience is fans, so if you vote Muggle, it would be a victory for Park Bom .... It's too ridiculous that this stage is lower than Paap.
=
Spring is my sister's promotions, and I'm going to fall in loves.
=
Obviously not fans but active idols, vocals or dance teachers who would have stayed at the top
=
Park Bom Cheer up
You're not a level singer
=
I just chew the song with my own ... ㄹ ㅇ It is incomparable digestive power ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ vibes coming out of the 요 ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
But the ranking is not necessary, but they are in the mood to compete and admire each other.
=
I'm sorry for the comments. The real disillusionment was that the real medics were also good on TV, but Park Bom wasn't even on the show. I didn't understand it, but I can't understand it more. It's really bad.
=
I've felt it before, Park Bom Red is really good.
=
Spring, if you see a comment here .. I'm glad you'll cry ...
There are so many young writings.
=
This is the perfect cover-stage of the original song melody
=
Park Bom is really. Where a real legendary lining.
=
It's a stage where you have to shoot first as soon as it appears.
=
It seems like Park Bom is hit by a man many times like this and he just calls his heart full of accessories.
The girls are so relaxed that they feel like they're screaming with a knife.
=
Wow, it's just because Parkbom style melts like it's really cool ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I think this is just because there's no other guys there.
=
I covered with Park Bom
When I first heard a song called
Maybe I've heard the original songs from the kids, but Park Bom covered it better.
=
One of the things I really heard was that this was a group song.
But it's so great to digest it
I think I'm so good at doing it
I think about it, the lyrics are so full
Besides, I didn't know that this was a girl song.
=
I think it would be nice to have Jeon So-yeon and Park Bom collaborate.
=
Is there anybody who fits this mission as a cover song more than anyone ... I don't even think of the original song ???????? # 5 hahahaha
=
3:11 LOL LOL
=
Real national treasure tone and unique vocal style.
=
Idols who are surprised in the middle are cute. ㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄲ ㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄲ ㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄲ ㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄲ ㅋㅋ Please look at the real surprise
=
Wow ... it's more addictive than the original song ... I don't remember how many times I've already seen this ...
=
The children's version is like 'Oh, just children' and Park Bom is really good at Park Bom's feeling.
+ Han Han seems to pull out the blade of revenge for Han's revenge, and Park Bom just puts the knife around his neck and feels 1 second before killing ..
Conclusion: Both are good
=
I feel like Park Bom molding, but I don't feel disgusted like the gangsters on Facebook. The more I look at it, the more I feel cute .... It looks like a real pretty doll ....
=
Oh, but Jeon So-yeon's real feelings are new. Cheetah, who taught herself at PewD101 101, rap and stood on the stage.
=
It's not as good as the original, but it's better
=
0:32 Idol, it's really cute
4:11 Park Bom is cute too.
Yes do it all
=
The sound is crazy
=
This is 5th place and Lovelyz is 4th place
=
Park Bom's voice is so good
=
You can't ignore the second generation of rice
=
Tone is surely the best
=
I was looking forward to how Park Bom would call it.
=
And So-yeon seems to be a great honor .. The senior singer wrote the song he wrote, and the one who was the one in the Pewdue featured. .....
=
2:54
Psychological changes
=
Honestly speaking, Park Bom is not disadvantageous .. Other groups have more than 4 people, but it would be difficult for Park Bom to digest songs by himself .. But Park Bom is really good ..
=
I think it's number one. Why is it so low ?, Legend stage.
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I have a lot of things to say .. Park Bom Fighting ㅠㅠㅠ Please come up ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
No matter how I think about it, I don't understand it's below Lovelyz Six Sense ...
=
Park Bom Klas is still great!
=
Before the end of Queendom, I'd like to see you standing together, whether it's Darin, Charin or Minji.
=
3:48 ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Very cute
=
This is the first time Park Bom sees in the comments.
=
I did ar live at the scene, but it was Mnet's Sval Flushing, and it doesn't look good. It's not natural. Don't get me wrong. please!
=
1:16 I'm so good at directing here.
=
Park Bom can't dance So cute ... I love you ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅜㅠ
=
1:09
In the meantime, I'm good at rainy season.
=
Yg is really unfortunate and disappointing these days, but as one of my favorite and favorite yg artists, I have never heard of the original song, but I just think it's like a real bakbom song. The cheetah featuring in the stage and the real cheetah featuring was amazing. It's a 5th place.
=
I'm grateful that I've just decided to come out with this program and I've been working hard for a few years.
=
2:55 Looks like a real dog. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow ... I'm calling alone from six people. The real king is Park Bom.
=
2:54 It's crazy or really pretty
=
Wetness Korean 왤 ke 햌 ㅋ ㅋ ㄱ ㅋㄱ ㄱㄱㄱㄱ ㅋㄱ ㅋㄱ ㄱㄱㅋ Gesture Korean also ㅋㄱ ㅋㄱ ㄱㄱㄱㄱ
=
This is where I'm ranked 5th. I'm really sad every time I look at her face.
=
Jiho is so cute at 2:46 ... But Park Bom is so cute. But this was the fifth place.
=
I'm really good at the top of the Park Bom Queen's stage.
=
I love you
=
2:31 Jimin ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
1:23 pronunciation ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Oh my real voice ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ 2ne1 I still can't lose it ,,,,, thanks for singing again Park Bom ㅠㅠ ❤️❤️ We are invincible right 1 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
=
3:02 Killing Part ㅠㅠ Spring is so cool Oh oh
=
I can't think of the original song, but it's worse than that. ??
=
2:53 My sister smiles a smile that's worth more than $ 10 million.
=
Makeup really goes well at this time
=
2:55 Unnie's feet are so cute TT TT TT TT TT ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
3:00 With really cool
Gesture really good
=
It's really good to see Park Bom in Queendom.
=
Wow I hope you gave me the Park Bom dance song
=
Toni One who sent a real elementary and middle school high school .... I'm happy to hear the real Park Bom voice again, but I'm sad that this is Toni One in my memories.
=
I don't know everything and the spring is so pretty I'm showing you what it's shining on stage.
=
If you are competing with your junior children for a long time, it might be a pride scratch in Park Bom's position, but I want to see more of this as an opportunity.
=
0:33 It's cute because it's out of balance.
=
Look like a real doll
=
I'm so cute over here
=
No, it's not a contest, but a level of celebration .. ㅋㅋ Cheetah in spring .. ㅋㅋ;
=
I love you
=
ㅠㅠ Why is such a huge stage fifth place? ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Really ... and just creepy ...
=
Just ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Not Queendom ..... Fandom ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'm still haha! I don't know why it's lower than .... ㅋㅋ Park Bom + Cheetah combination is not an invitation stage, not a contest ??
=
I keep thinking about this and I found myself calling Han Park as a spring version.
=
Juniors came to study
=
03:00 Gesture what is it ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I think it's much better than the original song
=
2:22 and Cheetah; No ... Wow; I'm hit by someone else.
=
1:23 She's so cute. She's so cute.
=
I don't understand that the stage is fifth.
I'm a senior president.
=
And goose bumps
=
But it's really like his song.
=
Really .. My skills are the same.
=
Stand out alone
It looks like a red rose with a very thick stem
The thorns are going to be so sharp and very fascinating.
=
Park Bom is so pretty and sings really well ♥♥
=
I love you spring
=
Sincere viewers should vote 50 each other 50
=
Park Bom's tone is getting tired, 1:06 Minni's feet are so cute ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Who saw this ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Park Bom Han is looking for a man again
I think I'll kill you when you come. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No, I don't think it's not that Park Bom will play against them.
=
It's yellow, but it's really good with Park Bom
=
I don't know this channel, but the Park Bom fan base isn't old enough to see the concert there.
=
Park Bom is so cool ㅠㅠ I'm so tired of addictive poses
=
I was really good at arranging it so when I first heard it I thought it would be at least third
=
Oh I missed you so much
=
It's great to fill this stage tightly by yourself.
Park Bom possible
=
Ahhhhhhahahaha 3:11 My face is really ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I don't think that Park Bom is dead
=
Park Bom is addictive Oh, I'll forget you, woo woo ~~~ I knew how to do it, but I'll do it ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Pak Bom is really unique. Honestly, I didn't know how to digest this song with my own. It may have been a burden to appear in this program, but as a result, it seems to be a good opportunity for Park Bom and tears from the last 2NE1 sign.
=
I want to really applaud the artists who keep choosing the legend stage regardless of the ranking. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
2:23 Cheetah looks tired ...
=
The voice is so attractive
=
He and the middle age Cheetah rap is very relaxing, but it's much better than a quick rapper.
=
Wow, crazy songs and stage dogs .. when you ~
=
3:12 LOL
=
I like the original, but I like it
=
Spring sisters are so cool ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Tomorrow I'm normal to see only spring sisters ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Cheetah's real voice is so pretty.
=
Wow ~ !!
=
2:55 with
=
Park Bom, I'd like to have a record with this concept ㅠㅠㅠ
=
And the tone is really unique.
=
2:22 Something cool
=
If CL came out in the rap part, it would have become a legend in the real legend ,,,,
=
Legendary Girl Group Main Vocal Class
=
3:12 LOL
=
Park Bom keeps rankings so low
When it comes to the hit song, the microphone sound
=
After singing this song, I didn't have any mind, so I raised my hands for my head and made a crown.
In the meantime, forgetting 2NE1 is deeply embedded in my heart.
=
So cool .... !!!! ♥
=
02:17 The cheetah is crazy!
=
Wow, it's really crazy. It's not a contest. It's like a private concert.
=
Doesn't Queendom hate Park Bom?
=
2:31 The bread in my hand looks good.
=
Park Bom's tone is really ... late.
=
Do it with Charin at Mama.
=
Oh, it's so cute at the end of the spring.
=
I like this cover! This is so beautiful! I like Park Bom! So pretty ~~~
=
Better than the original song
=
No matter how I arranged it, I'm digesting all the vocals that I sing, but it's not really Queen.
=
Oh, I love you so much. You're so pretty.
=
One of my favorite songs is Park Bom ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Why did you see this now?
=
It's like a queen
=
I can't ignore the real wamba. I'm walking around the stage without vigorous dances or effects, and choreographing the stage with only singing ability and tone. I'm a real queen. I think I came out ...
=
At this point, the voting audiences doubt the eyes.
=
I didn't know her sister is so pretty. I don't understand
=
This should be number one.
=
Wow
=
I do not understand Park Bom ranking.
I see it because of Park Bom ...
=
Ah ... the singer named Park Bom is really yuu ~~~~
=
Park Bom Tone is so good
Never come out of an idol again
=
Wow, the neck care is good.
=
Real digestive power
=
(Cheetah appearance)
So-yeon Jeon: Cheetah-chan !!!!!!!
Jimin: ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Park Bom, but I think I'm just watching his song .... Everyone can't help but think of the original song.
+ Why is this fifth? I'm joking, but I thought it was at least third .....;
=
Oh, the song is addicted.
=
Cheetah, Park Bom is a collaboration of artists I really like.
=
Oh, I did really well.
=
Does it mean that this stage is lower than the level
Paper airplane, Autotune is not for putting on the microphone, but for mr. do
=
3:23 Wow .........
=
I was really frightened to see the rankings. Lovelyz wasn't even arranging a contest but just a long-term pride level. Let's Queendom
=
The other teams are with their teammates, so there's something to do with them, but Park Bom does not have to be a presidential leader alone, but it's really hard to do it well.
=
At first glance, I didn't know it, but after looking at it,
=
It's just so much laughter
=
Is it lower than Lovelyz's true story?
=
Oh wow
=
It feels like a girl is quietly telling her not to come back and Park Bom feels like he's going to kill you when you go back again.
=
I thought I would be in third place, but I'm lower than Paap.
=
I ant love you sister
=
when you !!!!
=
She is great on stage
=
This is low ranking.
This is a ranking operation, but I do not want to hide at all .. ^^
=
Recently Park Bom shines like the old days
=
The crazy children felt like snakes, but Park Bom was like a devil.
=
Amnet doesn't lose her expectations, but she's acting like a cancer girl.
=
The real stage, the song, the concept and the Park Bom are all really crazy, but it's a bit lip-syncing, so it was a real 1% disappointment.
=
Spring Style ♡♡ Voice Charm
=
My sister's eye makeup is fatal
=
Did you know 2NE1 was done by hand at last?
=
Applause to Park Bom's courage in the Queendom ... ㅠㅠ solo solo would not have been easy.
=
Nisong Mine Skill Cast
=
Solkae 2Ne1 Fandom is huge, but Park Bom is alone, so I'm sad because I'm playing with Fandom rather than my skills.
=
It's ridiculous. Park Bom is fifth ?! Is it true?
=
Oh my god it was so cool
=
It's Amnet. Park Bom Flower Walk
=
This sister is so pretty and she's just a queen and she really loves you
=
Please give back to us ....
=
It's coming out, and it doesn't kill the feel of the original song, but it melts the Park Bom style properly. Dog
=
It's Chitara-no. It's a foul. ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Force is different ....
..... so I saw the Queendom Six Sense stage right now ....
=
Queendom seems to make almost legends
=
Arrangement is so good .. Why is this 5 times?
=
Serious legend on this day ...
I'm really pretty in spring, but I was pretty on this day !!
=
3rd and 4th stage indie.
=
How does Pahab win this?
=
Wow, it's like Park Bom song ㅋ ㅇㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The ending pose is so good at the end ...
=
When added, this song is Park Bom song ;;; It's scary because it's an annual ring.
=
ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Park Bom would have been able to be a C.L. if he stayed at the pharmacy .. Cheetah was great, but I just want to see some of the members of the group.
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Yes, I'll admit it, but is that lower than Lovelyz
=
The tone is unique
=
Wow ... like an emperor.
=
More constricted than the Queen's Legend stage song
Park is cool! Park Bom Good Luck!
=
Park Bom in a karaoke room
=
Park Bom is solo and I almost do all the parts and fill it up completely. No. 1 would have been enough ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ And I've been watching this many times ㅋㅋ
=
If you're lined up with your skills, the front row is just not right with the program.
=
Oh, I do 5 videos a day. Really .... I love you so much. I'm going to go crazy first, but I think I'm going crazy when I dance. I always go to Park Bom Eun-ni Oh ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I saw it in the Queendom Story video, but it's just a laugh. It's just pretty.
=
First, let's change the program name to fandom instead of queendom.
=
Editing and cheetahs are great, but it's great to have a group song and sing it.
=
Park Bom Cute
=
The scene was a live live. Why do you let the sink go so strangely that it looks like a lip-sync?
=
Every time a cheetah comes up, it's so cool. I'm drooling.
=
It's ironic that the best vocals sung by this music are pushed by Paap ~
=
How the hell is this stage lower than Pahaab? Is it 5th place?
=
Solo is really uncomfortable against group.
=
Mnet believes in the rankings because there are so many people talking about manipulation, but it's a little bad that such a stage is below Lovelyz.
=
Park Bom is so good ~~ See you in Queendom.
I keep listening to old songs ~~
Cool ~~~
=
What is it?
=
Cheetah is a really scary and really favorite rapper, but if Ciel came out, I don't know why, but my school days are 2NE1
=
Park Bom is alone, but the stage looks full
=
This is not 2ne1 complete, but Park Bom was alone so other groups couldn't afford it.
=
Wow, just admire Park Bom ㅠ. ㅠ
=
So Yeon is Master ...
=
It feels very different from the kids. Cheetah was good too, but Park Bom alone filled the stage. After all, the record remains. The appearance of other singers on stage looks lonesome, but I don't feel that way at all on stage. But please take a full shot. Park Bom dances.
=
It's cool to see it again ... this is the fifth place of the aca ... Honestly, the rank is meaningless stage.
=
I came out with the alucial tula tutu, but I feel like Lee Sun-hee's competition zone.
=
Wow spring is so cool !!!
=
I cheated on the cheetah here ...
=
My number one sister is my sister ... ❤️
=
This is fifth place ?? Nonsense!!
Are you afraid to dance to charisma? Park Bom ~!
=
Really good
=
I don't feel any children singing
=
It's already a year-end awards.
=
The tone is the best. Park Bom's song is a song I believe and hear. Whatever song is, Park Bom is the best song
=
Other kids' songs don't come to my ears ~~~~
Park Bom Songs are strong in my ears
Park Bom is the best !!!!!!
=
Arrangement is really different, it's a completely different song.
Park Bom's vocals are heavy, but Chita Lab's bewitching and heavy seems to fit together.
=
Why is one of the girls silent?
=
Honestly, I'm a teammate in my heart, but I want to continue listening to Park Bom alone.
If the CL is here, the game ends ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Idols are watching cheetahs and they say cheetahs ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Park Bom is fifth place ;;;; How are the kids playing around?
=
I'm so thrilled to see it as it's shit
=
There may be a dislike, but one voice seems really unique. The other people's songs are like their own songs, but because they are so unique, they can be disliked.
=
Park Bom ...
=
Lovelyz Stage is ahead of Park Bom Stage? ㅋㅋㅋ It's shit. Don't be real.
=
The cover is good, but the original song is good, but when I listen to the original song, I hear it boringly and come back again.
=
I haven't died in the spring. A legend has come out. I have only heard a song called Han.
=
3:01 see you
=
Park Bom, you did a great job and you were so cool. 반응 This reaction is a fandom that has been working hard for 6 years and polished more than 6 years, even more than that ... ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow. But Park Bom is really special. The children are also unique in tone.
=
Oh, my tears come up so why are you so happy
=
In the beginning, the rest is a group, but it's really a solo challenge.
=
The skills that I ripped off the stage
=
No Queendom goes up to the fans, not to the song
=
Even if you look at you! Part comfort pleasure
=
The guy who's also doing vocal training at the Berkeley School now competes with the current idol, but the fifth place is really true.
=
Spring alone saves 2ne1 complete body
=
Really cute
=
I thought Park Bom was the best because he was so good.
=
Real voice poisoning
=
Well done
=
It is one spring a day today!
=
Park Bom is the best for anyone!
Park Bom I love you!
=
It looks like an elegant swan
=
Oh my sister's chicken meat maker.
=
If you're cool, you're all sisters. I love you.
=
How many times are you coming again?
=
Park Bom is the best.
=
Arrangement completely good ... just made your own songs and pronunciation pronunciation differently from the existing songs .... I want to come out from the real 짬.
=
Even if I see you, I still miss you
=
Cheetah intro creepy c
=
The vocals are unique
=
Park Bom sister sister I love you pretty everyone
=
I have never felt so good.
=
I think this stage was second or third
The omar girl concept was amazing and this stage vocal tone was good
=
Spring is the prettiest than anyone else, 2ne1 I hope you come back again
=
How is this fifth?
=
Park Bom alone stage 2ne1
=
I think I've used all the strategies that Park Bom can use.
It's a great arrangement for the composer + Cheetah Chance + 2NE1.
=
If Han was originally a girl's parting song
Park Bom feels like the queen kicks a man
++++
(What is this like? Thank you ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ)
=
Night-time costumes Head sneakers Cheetahs are awesome
=
Park Bom is doing really well ... The rankings are down and the difference between them is wrong ... Park Bom No. 1 always do it ~ ♥ ️
I love you ♥♥ ️
=
Is that stage fifth? Voting is so fan-centered;
=
Park Bom Sings so well ... !!!
=
Get a text vote. How is this fifth?
=
I thought it would be first place.
=
I'm looking at this a few times ...
Spring sister is my number one forever ....
=
YANG HYUN SUK was just too dirty to contain them.
=
It's not a song that will get a low ranking.
=
I love Park Bom ~~
=
How did she not get first place? There's a problem.
=
I made it as a Park Bom song.
=
It was chewed even if only CL came out here
=
It's a remake of everything, but Park Bom is like her song.
=
And scarecrow, I'm creepy, but I'm sure all the hair is pulled out ... Just the level is different.
=
Really honestly speaking personal thoughts
2NE1 is not a popular group, and it's not a big group with a single senior (but of course it's not very popular).
=
And arrangement made a different song according to their own color
=
Park Bom is giggling here.
=
Pahab beats this? Singing Digestion From Heaven to Earth
=
I stole the song here too ...
=
A real drug dealer. Learning American hip hop with your body ㅠㅠ
=
I wonder if Park Bom will get better if he cares about dance performances and gestures
The gestures are so large that they make the song awesome, but it looks subtle.
The dancers are cheering up, but um ... the camera keeps squeaking but I can't concentrate.
=
It's amazing, it's creepy
=
I'm tired, and since I came back, I felt that the manners weren't the same as before, but on this stage, I can see the charisma of 2NE1.
=
Park Bom's voice is good but I don't feel anything exciting.
=
YG borrowed 2NE1
=
I couldn't imagine being a Chinese when the rainy season changed to Park Bom style.
=
I like my voice.
=
Park Bom's distinctive tone and rhythm No one can ever ㅠㅠ I seem to be a little bit broken, but I can't explain this unusual thing.
=
From the original song, I changed the arrangement altogether 2ne1, it feels good to be bluffed, and it fits so well with Park Bom's vocals, and the cheetahs choreographed on the stage are all excellent.
=
ㄱ ㅎㅎㅇㄹ ㅎㄹㄹㄹ ㄹㄱ
=
Cheetah wrap
2:16
=
Everybody come ~~ !! I'm not shocked but shocked ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I see fifty more times.
The more I hear, the less I fall
Park Bom Singer
To see and think again
I wish you always have a good day
=
first. VOICE'S VOICE GOOD VOICE ..
=
As a senior, I'm the most professional and real high-quality cover stage ... My skills are the first place ... ㅠㅠ Why the rankings come out really ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I'm all upset ㅠㅠ
=
I was worried about the peculiarity, but the Parkbom tone was chewed and I wasn't doing it. I've seen the most respected Park Bom in the past.
=
Park Bom was able to fill the stage alone. Some solo singers can fill the stage as well, but there are few people who fill the stage as much as idol groups.
=
I've already applied Park Bom from the beginning and I thought the game was over when the cheetah came out, but I really want to kill Amnet.
=
I hope you'll come and end 2NE1 at the end of Queendom ...
=
sister, I like you
=
Look again
=
Personally
Ohm Girls
2. Park Bom

5. Children
6. Lovelyz
This is Park Bom, but I was really good.
=
It's cool .....
.
=
I did this but I think it should be 2NE1
Please call quickly spring sister
=
Cheetah is good too, but I want to see CL or Minji.
=
Park Bom doesn't lose even as a fandom.
=
I've heard all the other things but I can't think of the original song.
=
What do you say to the spring sister?
=
Where is CL?
=
The real spring tone doesn't follow. Cheetahs are too good to be featured, but I screamed Ciel inside until I opened the door ... 2NE1
=
Cheetah
=
Your song Cast my song
=
Park Bom has a unique real tone
When you listen to the song, it sounds like it's crushed
Amazingly good lyrics
=
Wow, it's the fifth place in Cheetah and this is the fifth place.
=
When is it really time to post YouTube comments only ;;;
=
When I saw Jimin's cheetah
I was surprised
In the past, I struck Cheetah
=
What would it have been like if CL came to me?
=
Not only the real audience vote, but also the overseas + domestic character vote, ranking that stage, Park Bom 5th?
=
Do you love me
=
I think I'll fall behind
=
When the ending looks like a hand 2ne1 hand shape ...
I'll be waiting for reunion. Because John Wins !!!!!
=
Wow so good
=
At first I was disappointed but the more I look, the better I look sometimes
=
Honestly, I thought of course I would be number one. Arrangement was good. But I'm not a singer these days.
=
Honestly, after all the music shows, please
I want to talk to you ... I'm out of focus ... noisy.
=
If you sing 2ne1 in karaoke, you can see that most of the music videos are concerts, so all the members are playing like crazy.
=
Wow cheetah.
=
Cheetah is a specialty singer who Park Bom is a competing partner for aoa Jimin and a teacher for children Soyeon.
=
Celebration Stage: Park Bom
=
I think I've seen this 20 times, but I think it's a good thing if Park Bom's voice comes out once every 1000 years.
=
I didn't pay ...
=
I think it's at least third place.
=
The back dancer was really good. The costume song was all perfect. Park Bom ㅇ Good. In the middle, the back dancers danced so brilliantly that they only saw Park Bom.
=
I covered it with Park Bom.
=
No, it's a cheetah in the spring, but it's broken ♡
=
Wow, it's been a while since I've been watching a doll.
=
I love you mom ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
But if you loose your hair, Jinz scalp will hurt ...

No, what logic do you have to rank? Well, all the good guys are pushed back .... The cover song is arranged so much, and no matter how well you sing it ... I think I win by the number of fans rather than by skill;
=
Actually, the top two Park Bom 2nd and 3rd place No. 1 AOA Park Bom Children AOA These three teams are still looking for
=
I can't breathe as a solo but it sounds great because it's live.
=
I didn't know the original Han song, so this is the original song for me. The sound of the Park Bom is unique. If you listen to the Park Bom version first, you won't hear any other covers.
=
Spring sister
=
It would have been hard to decide if I was Park Bom, but it looks like it was the right decision
=
I'll be really crying when 2NE1 member comes out on the stage
=
Jimin and Cheetah are the same age.
=
It's been a while since Idols look the same and have no impact
I know that idols are working hard all of a sudden
I like that too.
Si Bure Just because of Tenny One 2PM
=
Pahab ^^ ~ ♥♥♥♥ wins this ??? ;;;;;; Eva
=
Honestly, audio was much more full than LovelyJu
짬 Naba can't be ignored ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm her mother
=
3:11
??????????? Seunghee ???????????
=
# 1 in my heart ♡
=
No, Queendom is good, but it's so much fandom red. It depends on which group of people are on the scene. Spring is good enough and it might be top.
=
Why is Spring 5th?
Hugh. Amnet would have played it again ...
=
no. Crazy. 2:55 ant
=
Look at the spring spring
=
Ugh ... Mnet I thought it would be ... haha ​​I've got a weird mic for a hit song contest ... I don't know if that song Park Bom is talking to Mnet.
=
Park Bom is always here ~ ♡
=
Cheetah is cool.
=
2ne1 that was so stuffy just to dismantle ... can such a good group come back? 2ne1 I wish we could rejoin each contract
=
This is what ...
=
Just sleep. Cheetah played a part.
=
I'm a fan of children but Park Bom is amazing! Beauty and reworking ㅎㅎ This is the operation of the Queendom is revealed here ㅠ Park Bom is ranked ...
=
Stage power is 2ne1 as it is .. Tone singing power sincerely .. Park Bom influence is this much ..
=
Unique like a different world
Soyeon is her song, but the reaction is cute.
=
It's good before you hear it.
=
I'm curious but what is the average age of blackjack in Korea? I knew 2NE1 song when I was starting, but I wasn't able to make a blackjack late.
=
Park Bom is a foul if there
If you have Ciel, you don't have to say that.
=
I don't just sing Park Bom's solo ballad.
=
Yes, Mnet is all a masterpiece. Now, all votes in Mnet are considered a masterpiece.
=
Was that stage fifth? Nonsense...
=
The cheetah was good, but if it came out CL, it would have been reversed.
=
At first, the dancers
=
It's a performance song, so all the other singers feel like it's a performance stage song, but this song was just a new album .. I don't know. Don't mind the rankings because it's unique.
=
In addition to the arrangement, the cheetah gets addicted to his face
=
2:56 When you just smile, your face is really emperor, you're so pretty, cool, cool, pretty, crazy
=
It's awesome. Really.
=
Spring
Wow!
I like you so much ~
=
K pop 4th spring sister 5th place
=
Honestly, it's worse than Cheetah Rap Jeon So Yeon
=
After all, except for Park Bom, the person who will take the first place of music by himself is not there.
=
I don't see the Queendom but I take it three times a day.
=
It's the same song, but it's completely different
=
Featured professional wrapper without representative song
=
Wow, Jeon So-yeon would have been a bit messy when the trainees sang the songs they made themselves.
=
Not to mention the stage, this stage is crazy
Did you change your hair color? This makeup looks so much better
=
The other groups all go out with a strong member, but it's too burdensome to have to sing and fill it up alone. It will be the best ever
=
I think it's crazy. One song is just a Park Bom song. Real dimension is different. Really.
=
Of course I thought it was the top .. 5th place? .... nothing to say
=
It's not just a fuck !!! Cool !!!!
=
Ha ... Park Bom is so good that I'm very minded ... Another group is so good.
=
Good
=
I wasn't able to find Queendom. Oh, idol fandom voting is not a bit honest .. ㅠㅠㅠ 무대 It looks like a stage without a real lack.
=
Is this a lip sync or a raven?
=
I think that I do not understand, but the fandom was applied equally in the same number. Fandom and the House of Commerce
=
Don't come away Don't look back-Ex-boyfriend-
=
The vibe from my deep jab ... you're just chewing the whole stage
=
Cheetah Lab is opening
=
At first, I was so used to the original song that I felt dissatisfied and turned it off.
=
Huh ..... wow
=
I think Aoa and Park Bom are almost # 1.
=
And Park Bom-chan
=
I thought it was Cheetah
=
2ne1
=
Who's missing in Mamamu?
=
It's too bad to see Park Bom's original style.
=
ㄹㅇ Class playing with toys like a stage ...
=
Honestly, I don't think there's anything better than Park Bom because of my ability in Queendom, but I think it's hard to come up with creative ideas than other groups alone, and my expectation for Park Bom is too high.
Park Bom wants to see a new and missed stage with other Tuenny members.
=
It's so cool.
=
Park Chun-a, please buy me the cheetah
=
Perfect Arrangement + Bak Tone + Cheetah just cheated too ....
=
Posne Park Bom like Manlevbos
Dog is cool !!!! The stage qualities are wrong
2NE1!!!! Park Bom!!!!!!
=
I like Park Bom with children .. It's a different concept.
=
Park Bom fills that big stage with one person. ㅠㅠ ㅜ ㅜ ㅜ Presence is insane and the arrangement has changed so well with you.
.. ㅠ ㅜ ㅜ ㅜ ㅜ
=
Pretty
If you do makeup like this
=
Legend
=
Crazy
=
Voice. Unique.
=
I really like rap
=
I found out that girls are original songs.
=
Lovelyz has five or six members, but the stage is empty.
Spring sister,
=
Transliteration, the volume is a stage that will be smashed even if you stick all other teams, but the ranking is different; This is the 1st place when I did 2ne1
=
Isn't it natural to go to the top of the table with Park Bom and children? I'm good, but don't you understand?
=
It's amazing to fill the girl group all by yourself.
=
The queen is out of town, this is the spring
=
When I announced the real rankings, I almost shed tears ... Spring sisters were upset, so I don't get hurt.
=
Come out when 2NE1 is absent because it's a real blank for 5
If you look at the stage, Park Bom is absent. -Nothing
=
The first time I saw this video, I did not think of the original song.
=
Please crush the stage as a complete stage for the special stage.
=
I don't understand this is low ranking
=
I feel like I'm sitting in front of a really big and great queen .. It's a big hit.
=
It's pretty when you smile a little bit since 2:55.
=
It's a real stage grip ... I love you ...
=
Arrangement is like this! I feel like I'm teaching the juniors' emotions.
=
There's a vibe coming out
I was good at selection and arrangements
=
But Park Bom-Bon is alone, but what happens if you bring 2NE1?
=
I don't know who you are, but if you go back, you won't be able to guarantee your life.
Spring is my sister 쨩 (ㅜㅁㅜ) / ♡
=
Park Bom fighting ㅠㅠ !!
=
Still, Park Bom enjoyed more than I thought, and I feel like I want to show all the accumulated power.
=
Why are you dancing so cute?
=
Voice addictive jackpot
=
I look at the stage of Park Bom, Idols look with longing eyes.
=
Anyway, Park Bom's sister is the best ❤ My sister is over the top because it doesn't matter because it's not really good
=
Isn't this how you can win Lovelyz?
=
I'll erase you like this in the second half
=
Everybody may be frozen on stage and missed the vote.
=
Park Bom's voice is so attractive.
=
The best of the best
=
Park Bom is so pretty!
=
Since fifth place ... Dirty self-ballots
=
The shoe is so cute
=
2NE1 I want to see ..... The song is addictive and not tired but good ... The voice is like a swamp ... I can't come out ... I'm still sucked in ... Really fascinating .....
4:44 I'm listening very well .... sing a lot.
=
It's a dog bar. I thought Park Bom would be at least third place.
=
Why is this the fifth place?
=
2:28 Wow, is this an idol too? You're going crazy.
=
I didn't show my videos to my dad and only listened to songs.
=
Mamamu and AOA stage It may be because I first saw the stage was too intense ㅎㅎㅎ I felt that I was not enough in the main room.
=
I like spring so much that I just sing without a circle Spring is your best! I was number one in my heart
=
I'm 5th and I can't follow Park Bom's vocals
=
It wasn't a 5th grade at all just by the number of views.
=
1:48 ... Six Senses ... you were.
=
Mnet, the news. Queendom needs reinvestment!
=
Legend 2:15
=
It was so good with Park Bom and I sang well ... It's too bad, I'm sad. It was the main vocal that gave the song a sense of invincibility, not a singer who suggested it as a dance. The cheetah was good, but if not all 2NE1 members would have won one of them.
=
CL What are you doing? Are you busy? Come and do the stage with Park Bom !! Then I'll tear my tears
=
Park Boon's shedding ... Singing style is cool. So stop your face. And you and i .. I wish that style music.
=
Park Boum's voice is so unique and strong, so it's hard to make songs as if you're singing your songs.
=
It's 5th place for the victims and Lovelyz 4th place ...
=
Ugh ... it's a fandom fight.
=
I want to see Park on the other stage, so I want to be good at this stage.
=
This week I've been playing it over 10 times a day ;;;; After taking it off ;;;;; 2NEONE Fragrance is properly loaded ;;;;;
=
I wonder why this is fifth because of the fan base.
2NE1 should be dismantled and fanned
And people who have been fans since 2NE1 are going to be in their 30s by now. Wouldn't this be the fifth place?
Honestly, the ranking I think
Oh My Girl-Eoe-Park Bom-Mamamu-Children-Lovelyz
Honestly, I'm really good at Eo
Mamamu was the solar, but I can see that he was a little clean, and the score was reduced. It's ridiculous that Lovelyz placed fourth. Paahab ~ Paahab ~ Not really suitable for the concept Do children have a similar atmosphere? Even so ...
In short, why, why, why, why was fifth place
=
Killing Part 49 seconds
Is it like lip sync
=
It seems that the difference is obviously changed to his style than other stages .... The style certainly changes .... 걍 Park Bom song itself?
=
Everyone seems to know spring skills, so it's nice and lumpy now.
=
Park Bom came out alone, so 2ne1's completely finished
=
Oh really, Park Bom is crazy that 2NE1's unique stage power is like nobody comes along.
=
This foreigner said that the lyrics seem to be talking to yg.
=
But it's true that Park Bom is awkward to gesture or dance on stage.
=
It seems like you've done so well that you've made a new performance with Park Bom-sik. Too cool I can see the rice
=
Honestly, Oh My Girl-Park Bom-aoa-Mamamu-Children-Lovelyz
=
Park Bom is so good
=
Really, I saw the gel legend of Queendom ㅠㅠㅠ
=
3:09 Seung Hee Reaction ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
When I watched this video at first, I thought I was weak because I didn't know the original song.
=
3:40
I keep coming in to see this.
=
As a result, Cheetah was also a lead for Soyeon, but Jimin was a competitor.
=
Those audiences are younger than their age ... Is Park Bom less aware?
=
How is this 5th place ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Great to hear every time ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom is a treasure ㅠㅠ ❤❤
=
This is too wasteful for fifth place, but the other group is fan-sucked ...
=
I love you so much
=
Personally, I'm a dog legend Park Bom Legend ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's been a while since I've been out there.
=
I thought the witch would witchcraft when Park Bom sang ...
=
2:56 Just laughter
=
The crying voice is yours ㅠㅠㅠ
=
What kind of Kim Yu-na Sotnikova's feeling is back .. 5th place is not so severe that it fits the name of Queen more than anyone .. ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm just going to sing for the spring! cool
=
So why is it lower than Rubbly?
=
I read a dog, but why is this the fifth place?
=
It's the last hand 2/2
=
3:41 School
=
Why are you in fifth place?
=
2ne1 hand gesture at the end of spring
=
Park Bom is a good image ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I think I'll die when I get closer.
=
Wow ... the only word is Park Bom
But why is Mnet like a lip sync?
I want to see live stage
=
Is it a voting ballot? Park Bom is fifth.
=
Your sister's voice is so good
Sometimes when my friends say that Park Bom's voice is shaking and unstable, I don't want to go and have a bad throat. I can't stand it.
But I still like to hear
=
Paa'aab Paa'aab (Frowning)
=
I'm good at dogs, but I'm just
=
I saw the original song, but the concept is so good
=
The ranking is based on the number of YouTube views and video likes
=
The ranking is weird ... ;;
=
I understand that Park Bom is lower than Love Town. 읍 ㄷ ㅂㄷㅂㄷ !!
=
Popular votes .. I don't see it
=
Why not first place? The atmosphere is overwhelming
=
It's so pretty and so good. It's really ridiculous to do this alone.
=
Park Bom, I'm pretty
=
It's a sudden thought, but it's going to shatter
=
No. Why is this fifth?
=
I thought it was Park Bom's voice, but it's good to see you focusing on the song without any perforations.
=
Wow you made your own song. I'm alone with many people. Chita Lab was great too. Stage was good
=
Still there are people who post here saying they didn't drug Park Bom. It's so sad and heartbreaking that I don't want to take it out. Since Park Bom debuted in the United States
The four types of amphetamines included in Ether, a drug prescribed for the treatment of ADD by ADD, are intended for therapeutic purposes to avoid hallucination / pleasure effects. Not a drug It's not a medicine for that purpose. There are many different types of amphetamines, but the general public, who lacks expertise, tends to identify methamphetamine and amphetamines, which are usually taken for hallucination / pleasure purposes. Ether does not contain amphetamines with strong pleasure / psychedelic effects such as methamphetamine. It is a US FDA licensed drug. Park Bom's diagnosis is ADD, so there is no reason to take drugs, and there is no insane doctor who prescribes drugs to a healthy person. However, as there is a risk of addiction / dependence due to psychological and arousal effects, it is randomly classified as 'narcotics' in Korea and regulated under the Narcotics Management Act. 'Drugs' and 'drugs' are quite different concepts. Classification as 'narcotics' does not mean that non-drug ingredients or drugs become drugs. In 2010, it was an issue in customs clearance without customs declaration, and it was found to be negative on drug test in the investigation based on the psychotropic psychological grade at that time and it was taken as prescription without overdose. In other words, the prosecution receives a "nothing in conflict with the law." After that, we will move the hospital to a domestic hospital and change the medicine to a domestic distribution drug. By the way, this suddenly burst four years later in 2014, without any professional knowledge in this field (I know that the beginning of the Chirashi was a world day), and without any medical / legal scientific verification, it was a crappy report (" The drug that Park Bom took and shipped in Korea without customs declaration was found to be a serious drug even though it was a therapeutic purpose. How can the drug import case be suspended? This is a prosecution investigation for YG at the prosecutor's office. Witch hunting with family drug gang, drug smuggling, and YG-finding investigation is the Park Bom Drug Scandal. There's a lot of talk about why who buried the best top star of the time and disbanded the best legend group 2NE1 with such a ridiculous mass of media and public opinion agitation. I will use only facts here. For reference, there are people who confuse ADD and ADHD. Unlike ADHD, ADD has nothing to do with aggression, violence, impulse. If you look at Park Bom, you are totally mellow. I'm crying and throwing stones at people all over the world. The wounds and traumas of the heart that have been torn. I can't imagine how great the fears and fears of the world and people are. It's not something that an individual can afford. Nevertheless, I said, "I love singing so much and I want to be loved by singing."
(Additional) I read the comments below, so many people confuse it and add more. Not drugs in the US become drugs in Korea, and drugs in Korea are not drugs in Europe. Drugs are defined by precise academic definitions and standards. Ether or the four types of amphetamines contained in it (Amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, and dextroamphetamine sulfate) are not drugs. Being regulated under the Narcotics Control Act, non-drug drugs are not recognized as drugs in Korea. Park Bom made a negative on a drug test conducted at the time of customs clearance in 2010. If Ethereal is a drug in our country, then the drug test came out at that time. Some of you talked about the cold medicine and ethereal mixed with codeine, and codeine is a serious drug. It's a different dimension than the amphetamines in the ether. I'll give you an example to make it easier to understand. The drug "NyQuil" is a common cold medicine that can be purchased without a prescription in the United States (also available online shopping). However, there is a risk of poisoning / dependence due to the psychotropic effect of dextromethorphan, which is contained in the inner quench, and is regulated by the Narcotics Management Act in Korea. It is common in the US, but in the same context as regulated Ether in the country. That's not to say that Nyquill is a drug or a drug in Korea. Even if you have obtained Nyquin from a foreign country and shipped it to Korea, you will be caught at customs clearance just like the Ether unless you declare it in advance. That doesn't mean the person reverses the stigma of drug or smuggling. However, if the media cleverly deflects the use of drug use and drug trafficking and various plausible grounds, the drug Nyquill or Dextrose Metropan is unfamiliar and the general public who does not have expert knowledge believes only the information exposed to the media. Will be. The scandal at that time was provocatively inflated in that way, and unlike the scandals that received the enormous attention of the public, the process that turned out to be misrepresented and derived from false grounds was quietly outside the public's interest. It's going on, so many people still don't know the truth. In fact, it is not uncommon for a general person who does not know about the Narcotics Control Act to take customs in foreign countries from customs clearance. This is because the Narcotics Management Act contains nearly 200 psychoactive ingredients in addition to 'drugs.' This information is difficult for the general public to access, and it is difficult to understand even if it is not common sense. When this issue occurs in customs clearance, the procedure will be followed according to the psychological level set for each drug, and if the investigation confirms that it violates the law, that is, 'other than therapeutic use', it will be recognized and punished. . Park Bom was investigated according to the procedures at the time of the customs clearance issue in 2010, had a negative voice on the drug test, and found it to be taken as a prescription without overdose. On the contrary, all of us who have been buried in the past five years, buried and thought of the damage and wounds suffered by Park Bom couldn't protect her and stood on the side of a cowardly ignorant violent majority who were indiscriminately bombed at one person who were too fragile. It is necessary to admit and repent. That is a sin of great ignorance. I think it's the way to be forgiven and to care for her more than ever before, to care for her with warm heart, and to help her focus on singing as soon as possible.
(Finally) Some people speak bystander like others' work. However, there is no way that this terrible thing can happen again, when a good person becomes a sinner and is forgotten and forgotten in this world by someone powerful or by the tyranny of the press. Is it something that will never happen to us or to those we care about and love? Unfortunately, what I felt when I looked at the Park Bom scandal was that it wasn't. One innocent man could be buried and forgotten so simply. What if you become a party to such a thing? Aside from the big and small, the helping hand will be eager. Anyone who reads this article is interested in it, and there are many contents in the comments, so I hope you read it carefully, and still spread the false facts such as' Magic Use 'or' Mr. Please be kind and shy when you meet.
=
I thought one style would go well but I didn't think the song would go well but it's really crazy.
=
You control all the songs by yourself
It's because you're not from three major companies
=
Singing
=
I want to see you once more, but I really like Park Bom, but if you have CL and Citizen here, you can do it.
=
The voice is in its prime.
Honestly, the idol contest seems to affect the appearance factor.
In the case of Park Bom, he participates with his hand cap unintentionally due to the gap between his appearance as a solo and Liz.
But as soon as I start singing, I forget that.
In 2NE1, I had the power to focus people on my voice.
=
Wow, where did you go to Park Bom?
=
Cheetah, it's awesome, haha
=
Park Bom + Cheetah combination was a great stage, but they rank lower than Lovelyz
=
I sing all the songs by many people and even dance ..
=
Honestly, there's a guy who's up there, that challenge is so cool and so good.
=
Cheetahs are great too, but if they came to Ciel by featuring, it would have been furious.
=
I believe Mnet.
=
Oh, let's get rid of the admiration in the middle. How long will it last?
=
I made a stage with Park Bom and Cheetah. Do it.
=
Why is this so good when Jeon So Yeon is a cheetah?
=
Did you really inject Buff with Park Bom? Is that exactly the way Park Bom calls it in this video?
=
It's a disadvantage because I'm alone. I think how old I look at other teams .... ㅠ 무대 If I go up on the stage, I can't see anything.
=
Is this fifth place ??? The rest of the kids didn't seem to sing so well ... is this the fifth place? Let's just vote voting ^^
=
Arrangement is really amazing because the feeling of the original song is very little. .
=
Ya elementary school festival cover was fourth, but mama's first solo song was fifth. What's up with Mnet?
=
Thumbnail It was so pretty.
=
I really love you Park Bom ㅠㅠ Sister, take me whit ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Cheetah was really good too, but if it was 2NE1, it would be on the legend stage.
=
Spring is good
=
This is lower than Pa ~ Hop❤️ ????
=
It's ridiculous that it's fifth.
=
If one style is based on Park Bom's voice, it will be different.
=
Twisting tongue is so good.
=
Is this fifth? You're so crazy lol
=
I feel once again that Park Bom is not the level I'm going to stick with other kids here.
=
Real voice
=
What was Jimin's reaction when he came out?
=
That's what's the fifth place.
=
Thumbnail pulled well over Joan
=
Park Bom is called alone because it's a disadvantage.
=
Cheetah and Seolhyun see Jimin. Why are you so funny?
=
Best !
=
It's a stage filled with tones without a popo, so it seems that the group that Pero is prominent can do well unless he does all the lyrical ballads.
=
Give me the sound with the spring version ..
=
I'm in love
=
Honestly, spring is more beautiful and cute
=
I thought you'd be in third place.
=
It's just amazing to see this
Then, I looked for a little like a mountain bum Park Bom.
=
The fifth place is hard to understand
How is this stage fifth?
I just made it myself.
=
Park Bom is like a real queen ... I'm overwhelmed by one.
=
Spring hand
^^
=
I thought it was the first place.
=
Jimin Cheetah wasn't a friend
=
You should notice that I called you up tall.
=
If you're in a lap and dancing in a civil park, and you're standing at Sandara Park Center, you can't do it now.
=
Before this program is over, please let me do one song in 2ne1 only once ㅠㅠ I'm really curious ㅠㅠ I miss you so much I miss you so much !!
=
I talked about Park Bom's ability problem in the previous episode and commented that it was a microphone problem.
It's nice to be able to show the fact and the class properly on this stage.
I wasn't a Park Bom fan, but I was a fan of children.
Your skills are coming
=
Jeon So Yeon will be strange. I think it's going to be weird because your rap Master featured in the song you made.
=
Park Bom doesn't dance. I think I should be dizzy, but there's something like that
=
Honestly this time Park Bom should be No.1 Real creepy song
=
It's like a cubic tear drop in my eye
=
So Yeon must have been really happy .......
=
Crazy Chicken Boost
=
Park Bom's tone is very hip and luxurious .. It's a really precious tone.
=
And the intention of the Queen's Planning
=
I'm listening to this song, but it's just like Park Bom's song.
=
Mamamu and Park Bom don't want to be successful because they are so lucky. I want them to be successful. Each of them has a unique personality. Park Bom's solo song Bom got a really good song, and it's been a good solo.
=
There's a lot more stages to win first place, but there's more than one stage to win first place. I don't think it's any lower than Blaze.
=
Waiting room singers look at the eyes of the rankings just guess what ... I look at the concentrated vs gimmicks of fun enjoyment can not really be manipulated?
=
Why is the ranking so low ???
=
Honestly, Park Bom is not a special .. My face is so strange. When I sing, the lyrics are lumped together ... But this song is really .... I can't understand why the ranking is so low.
=
Park Bom can't judge with his skills.
=
Cheetah Rap is so damn good.
=
2:55 At this time, when you smile, the beauty really bursts out.
=
Replying to @SilverSky
I always support you and love you❤❤
=
2:44 You look like a gel senior.
=
2:26 You're so cute.
=
I don't understand that this stage is fifth.
Anyone can see what you've tried, and your skills are really good
=
I like this song ㅠㅠ why it was fifth place.
=
Cute
=
I honestly thought it was so good
A little unfortunate
=
I want to see 2ne1 at Queendom
=
Wow ㅠㅠ Real ... Godbom .... God ㅠㅠㅠ Children are not a group without a color in the song, but I almost filled out the park with only important things left ... How is that? It's amazing
=
Spring again
=
Fuck M-Calnet Mnet lol
=
Ah cheetah so cool Why is there no cheetah in the comments?
I've been listening to the Cheetah Rap.
I like it so much
Oh, I'm sorry. Cheetah.
=
2:45 I'm sprouting up ... I've been playing with a fan, but not at all cold.
=
That's not weird even in second and third place.
=
Park Bom always cheers TT. If I'm disadvantaged, I can be disadvantaged, and I'm stressed and stressed by accusations, mold monsters, etc.
=
3:48 Cider Cider Cider
=
Park Bom ~~ !! Fell
=
I didn't know you didn't see Queendom.
That Paap ~~! Is it true that Lovelyz was fourth and Park Bom was fifth?
=
Voice and song go too well together
=
The only thing that fills the stage alone and makes you feel comfortable without getting tired while walking around the stage is that it's a career difference.
=
# 1 in our hearts
=
There are two cheetahs and close friends. Jimin Soyeon ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Park Bom No Park Ball
=
Cheetah is cool ...
=
How about the feeling of So-yeon who sings the song that she made and even the teacher of Pewdu !!
=
It's too burdensome
=
I personally think it's much better than the original song.
=
The ranking is meaningless ~~~ It seems to be advantageous if the fandom is big anyway. It looks like there's a regular rust ~~ That's why the fans are going to the normal rust ~ After 5 years of rest, it's great ~ Just let's enjoy!
=
They have no eyes to see.
Did the younger vote;
=
Honestly, it's all good, but when I move on to the cheetah part
=
I had a contest and I made a year-end awards.
=
Awesome ,,,,,,
=
No ... Park Bom It's hard to do this alone. Why do you always do it alone? This score is too big .. Other people are good, but Park Bom is alone but he is so good ...
=
I just want to see you
=
I don't know other kids, but Park Bom doesn't understand
=
When using comments, respect others and follow our Community Guidelines.
=
I was looking for the original song. . . Well
=
Park Bom really presence in the presence ....
=
I think that the video and the atmosphere can be very different.
=
I hope you'll put all the strength of 2NE1 mebo on the stage. Don't think about it. Please show us a nice performance.
=
I watched it five times as if it was creepy It was so good to see it changed and Park Bom was so good.
=
It's so fun to see Jimin and Soyeon's faces
Jimin used to fuck Cheetah in an unwrap before. So Yeon was a PewDup.
It was so fun to see Jimin's expressions and Soyeon's likes
=
Park Bom
=
It's a unique song, so it's hard to cover, but I'm not going anywhere.
=
As a woman in her 30s, I thought this song was Park Bom ... yg? I hope you will recover with confidence no matter what your face is. It's really a waste to be good at it. There's a force in the voice as much as the cheetah's feeling.
=
0:47 Self-reflection ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Hair style makeup when cheetah came out
I thought of Unpretty Lab Star, but Jimin was nice.
=
All the singers seem to be coming more than the 1st contest. It looks like this is really going on.
=
Park Bom is not going to be stuck there,
=
Yes, Park Bom is Park Bom, where are you going?
=
It is a jewel. I contracted for a while, but my agency is helping me shine again. Let's shine again in spring
=
I couldn't understand why it was the fifth place as I saw it.
=
I thought it would be higher than the sixth sense.
=
Other songs "I want to hear the original song!" This is it
This is not good at all.
=
If 2ne1 fans vote, it is equivalent to that of idols over there ...
=
I feel like I'm perfectly fit
Park spring tone is over the cross
Singer
What if it was CL, not cheetah?
=
Shouldn't Park Bom save as a mini album?
=
Why do I like Park Bum more?
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Really absurd that is where the stage is 5th place TT ㅠㅠ Park Bom sister alone stage how hard ... Oh really I'm all upset ..
=
Park Bom I was good but why is it 5th place
=
5th place? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ The stage of Park Bom is more impressive than the number of Lovelyz; And Park Bom is 37 years old now. 봐 It's ridiculous just to see it on stage
=
2:18 Cheetah Rap Part Voice is so cool
=
It seems like Park Bom has the ability to make his own songs ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
Shouldn't I be yours too?
=
I'm good, but how is this stage 5th?
=
I enjoyed this stage so much. Why is it 5th place?
=
How could Lovelyz be 4 and Park Bom is 5th?
=
I saw your hands at the end ㅠㅠㅠ ??? That's the shape of your hand when you say hello to 2NE1. I miss you so much.
=
I'm coming
=
Why is this 5th place?
=
♥ ️ ♥ ️
=
Why is this lower than Lovelyz? I don't really understand.
It's better to wink for a sixth sense song than this stage.
=
You're so pretty. Don't dwell on the rankings! My sister did the best vocals, dances and performances !! Please enjoy your favorite music
=
This is gel good
=
The tone is also unique, Park Bom is the best.
=
I really want to see the stage where Park Bom's voice is produced by Jeon So-yeon
Hold the point well and explode with a hard voice !!
=
It's a million times better than Paap ~ ♡
=
Oh, I'm here again.
Sound source is good, but after all video is best
=
You did so well !! I'm so glad to see you on TV, but I want to see you on TV more often!
=
2NE1 is different, just Park Bom song children!
=
Two elder sisters ... Bomb Cheetah.
=
Oh, I love you
=
Expression and performance are the most natural.
=
Thumbnail Zona Ipudang
=
If it's better than the original song, what shall we do?
=
I thought this was awesome, why is it fifth?
=
It's amazing ... Was it fifth? TT
=
This is fifth place; No way, at least third place is normal.
=
It's not a vocal joke.
=
Lovelyz No. 6 and I can't fall, so I make it under Park Bom who takes control of the stage alone ?? Seriously Lovelyz should drop to sixth place.
=
Ugh!! It's a song that girls love 'han'
It's a cover song and it's become 'Han' of Park Bom.
Park Bom was really good by herself.
cool!!!
=
Park spring is the best
=
Thick voice? Even though it's a powerful voice, diction is good because it's sharp and hard
=
I felt watching Queen Queen episode 5, but when I edited Park Bom, there were a lot of things that seemed to be a bit frowning .... ;;;,
=
And singing
=
Is it a rainy season foreigner?
=
It's a fifth place on the top, even if it's a real top;
ㄹㅇ Mnet makes a program because he wants to swear
=
If you don't know the original song, you'll think it's Park Bom;
=
Thumbnail I'm just like ping-pu? It's strange
=
Is this live? Good song.
=
I thought I would do third place
=
Spring's sister is also great as a solo but always misses the members and every time they scream team tumbling.
Please have a dream like you want me to come out here.
=
Why do you think it would tear me away
=
Just for the kids, it's an honor for the president to cover.
=
I climbed up to the top of the idol world, and I do not know how to start from the bottom in a moment I do not really know .. Park Bom feels really eaten ..
=
This is 5th place !!!! Why are the children 6th place?
=
The musicians that have gained the most popularity in Korea are also different. From force, to song digestibility ;;
=
It's like digesting a song ..... When I look at the other cover, I keep thinking about the original song.
=
Really ... I don't remember the original song 걍 Park Bom's song ...? Wow .... It's a real vocal recital, and there's a cheetah combination ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's creepy from the first measure;
=
I don't know, and I want to get over 2ne1 intact
=
This is Tomb King 10 years Park Bom ㅠㅠㅠ Mr. Wah The only person who can digest this song is Park Bom, really. I thought it was a children's song, but Park Bom has digested it as if it were his song.
=
It was like Bak Bom's solo stage.
=
How is this fifth? Mnet's an ant.
=
It's because I like the song. The stage where Park Bom-stage is most memorable
=
I want to see you again
Pop songs are also mischievous ...
=
Spring ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I feel so pitiful every night
=
I'll bring all three of you.
=
It wasn't strange even if I was in the first or second place, but it's unfortunate that it's the fifth place ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I love you so much.
=
I wasn't a fan of Park Bom, but I was so happy to see this
=
I don't understand it. Honestly, I'm much better than Russian. I'm alone, I'm filling the stage. I don't know why John and the children are sixth place.
=
This is live mr remove report
=
This outfit and makeup really go well with Park Bom.
=
I'm tired of spring. I love you. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ But this is the fifth place? what the..
=
I'm filling the stage alone ~~ Park spring song ~~ Good job ~~ Cool ~~
=
Park Bom doesn't have to be a member alone.
=
Unaf 1: Cheetah, Jimin
Produce 1: Cheetah Jean, So Yeon
=
Park Bom is good too!
Cheetah Rep is so sexy that she will be killed again
=
Ignore the ranking
Really good
Awesome ~ Park Bom
=
Juniors Reaction Soulless
Lol
=
Park Bom's real voice is amazing.
=
Spring is the best, always cheer everywhere, always
=
I like the song and thank you for coming out .... I see you often.
=
It's a pretty stage, but I can't believe it's 5th place. I hate Mnet Park Bom ...?
=
I really like Park Bom's voice, so I come to listen.
=
Wow, I came to listen to 43 times
=
When the kids called, it was okay ~ Park Bom Han kept thinking in her head and watched more than 10 times
The tone is so good
=
The tone is real unique
=
A girl's face tells me .. This stage was hard 3:16
=
No, I came back to see Queendom's return report for 5 today and I'm creepy from the beginning.
=
Cheer up ~ Bom ~ You're the number one because you put your pride on yourself
=
I was good at you;
=
Honestly, I don't know much about this, but Park Bom was so cool
=
Why five places
=
3:10 Seunghee is so cute
=
I don't like watching Mnet because they don't like Mnet.
=
Awesome
=
It looks like Park Bom's voice looks like an edge.
=
It's the radish that passed by Park Bom is so cool You chewed it all together
=
It's great Why fifth place ??!
=
Class is still
=
Queendom audience honestly the fans do not make sense
=
Excessive molding ... I do not know what the pilgrimage ... but it seems to interfere with pronunciation ..
=
Many of the teams competed this contest. But it's not the stage that's going to be fifth.
=
I think I see it more than five times a day, but now every time I hear, I cry
=
Really Arranged Who touched it?
=
I think Park Bom wasn't 2NE1 for this stage.
I want you to have 2NE1 complete once
=
Soul from the voice shows that it is different from other groups ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Even though I admire while watching other performances, I finally come back here ㅠㅠ Arranged like a real song and the tone is also unique ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Vote for operation
4th Lovelyz
5.Park Bom
6th child
Can't you say this?
=
I wanted to hear Park Bom's voice too much.
=
It doesn't make sense to be lower than Rubley.
=
Amnet
=
What is called Park Bom lip sync? Other idols are grouped and divided into parts.
=
Wow, this video comes out and I've been watching and listening to it twenty times a week. How 5th .. Too bad for the stage ..
=
I don't really understand that this is the fifth place. Children just wrote six songs, regardless of their skills, but this was really unique.
=
Why is Park Bom here?
=
Sister Park Bom sees her get used to the stage and get used to it.
=
Arranged the song ... Honestly, I thought I'd be good at singing children's song
=
Why do you like a drugman?
=
I keep hearing
=
Wow, I can't really say that .. I'm so good at it ... I'm good at Mamamu, and I'm good at all those who come out. Why are you taking these talents and confronting you? I can't understand why Mnet will die only in such competitions as survival and death survival.
=
You keep making me suspicion Amnet; How is this fifth and how children are sixth ;;;;
=
Where is Park Bom Red Dress?
=
* It's great to call all six people alone. *
=
Really other idols did too well, but I didn't really lie and the basic Park Bom was doing 1 day a day of course.
=
2:27 ㅋㅋㅋ So yeon cheetah
=
2:43 I'm not too happy to be too old ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:56 was hit hard was hit
=
3:16 "I'm crazy ..."
=
Looks like acting ㅠ TT TT TT stage manners ㅠ TT TT TT TT TT TT is like Park Bom when the perfect ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ also career and skills does not go anywhere;
=
Park Bom's stage was so good ~~ Let's enjoy than the rankings ^^ Sometimes it doesn't work, but I always cheer. Personally, Park Bom's feat Red Rock-Unknown musician And not to mention Y & I Don Cry Acoustic Version ~~~~~~~~~~
Vowels Frequently Listening List ^^ Tzuuk ~~~~ Let's sing long while having fun ^^
=
The real tone is so good, especially personal and addictive. So I can envy songs in my own style.
=
Real tone unique. Any song can be digested like your own clothes
=
One of Park Bom's better
=
It's really hard for one person to fill the stage, but if you think that one member from another group will stage in Queendom, you won't be able to fill the stage.
=
It's really soaking up
=
Do you sing while chewing Park Gum? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Oh ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=
I keep hearing it ㅡ ㅡ ㅋ Cheetah part is a jilrim.
=
Why is this stage lower than Pahab?
=
Park Bom's unique whimsical gesture is so cute ...
=
The singer sings while taking control of the stage by herself .. The real professional is a professional ..
=
After hearing this, Park Bom's voice overlaps.
=
I used to watch Queendom to see Park Borealis
=
Hanta Zonnab combination;
=
Put your hands on the intro and look around, punching in the late highlights and turning around in the middle of the song.
+ Cheetah toxic dog
=
It's like Park Bom song
=
Cheetah Wake
=
Cheetah rap comes
=
Very humble, cool and cheetah rap well constitution ,,,
=
Park Bom is cool
=
If you sing a group song alone, you should really give first place
=
I should have called this micro you and i ...
=
Although the number of votes and ranking is low, I think that it was the best stage so far in my opinion
=
Why is this stage lower than Lovelyz?
=
5th place Park Bom 6th place
I don't think there's any reason lower than Lovelyz.
=
It's not the stage to be 5th.
=
Cheetah Lovers are the best
=
Honestly, this is a bad thing for Proman, and the fans fight who is good, high, low, idols
I hope not.
=
Pronunciation why not get better ??
=
I can only sing a group song alone to fill the stage.
=
The more I saw it, the more kids and Park Bom, and it wasn't enough to be pushed by Lovelyz.
=
By rank
Oh My Girl, Aoa, Park Bom Top
Mamamu middle
Children, Lovelyz Sub
Lovelyz kolchi should make sense, but it's ridiculous that Park Bom is in fifth place, and only pd was so sorry
=
How is this stage 5? No matter how bad it is, it's ridiculous.
=
Zzi and zzi clear
=
This proved the bad sound in the first contest. Park Bom is Park Bom ... Freshly ...
+ You are the author! I'm sorry to see you without any doubt. It looks a bit awkward to see again ... If my comment was a fight between fans or controversy between the viewers I will delete ... Sorry for writing a comment TT TT Happy Chuseok!
=
In an objective sense, this contest is the second one after the real oh my girl. I think Park Bom was the second best.
I'm not a fan.
=
Expected a lot of CL, but Cheetah is also mushy ...
I hope you will do it with 2NE1 members later. LOL
By the way, the spring sister's tone.
=
Reaction Overaction is sick?
=
The video is uploaded and I'm checking the video every day. Thank you so much for our spring sister.
At that time, he told me that he didn't go back and forth on the days related to medicine, and that he was trying to make a drug that was irrelevant to stopping activities due to the public.
In the end, 2ne1, the only thing that really mattered to her in spring, was gone. Whenever she talks about 2ne1, she still feels painful.
And thank you for showing me a smile and singing to the fans.
Would it have been different if he had denied it more actively then?
Whenever I go to the stage alone and watch my sister who is not one in the air, I am worried about the spring sister and the public who loves the spring sister.
=
In other senses, you can't listen to the original song skills.
=
6 people sing a song like that well .. Park Bom is Park Bom.
=
Park Bom is Park Bom Jin Jinja No matter how other people sing their voices are made of their own songs ... ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Replying to @David_Golden @GoldenHorse
=
It's like a real spring song.
=
Oh my girl reminds me of the comment that hangs on the video ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Park Bom has cast your song.
=
What are you listening to? Are these kids higher?
=
I'm much better than Real Loves, but I'm fifth.
=
I think it's ten people in my back, but I've got ten people in between. Nowadays, I've been bringing him to a solo solo among the groups, but it's not that much ... I didn't know Park Bom, but I didn't know it.
=
Does it make sense that this stage is fifth? 3rd place
=
I do not understand ;;; What's the fifth place crazy than that group? Nonsense..
=
It makes sense that it ranks lower than Rubbly ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ? I'm crazy, just ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Park Bom has already done the tone, ability, and existence itself. I really enjoyed my ears
=
In the last round, I would like to come out with 2nd complete one .. I think it's creepy
Park Bom sings alone and opens the stage, and from the middle, I'm going to take a CL civic community Sandara Park and take a real legend ㅠㅠ
=
Apparently cheetah came out and people staged alone in Park Bom ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋ Although the cheetah made some adjustments, it would not be easy for some singers to make cheetahs
=
2:55 It's just a smile. It's so good. It's so nice to see my face before my debut ..... ㅠㅠㅠ
=
So Yeon and Jimin are so cute when they come out of cheetahs. Ying ㅠㅠㅠ Both Feduna and Unf still contacted Cheetah and contributed to her.
=
Even though Park Bom was good at dancing ㅠㅠ voice is absent but the gesture is awkward and awkward
=
I don't understand how that stage will be ranked fifth.
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Response to the appearance of the cheetah
SOYEON: This is Chita!
Seunghee (fan): Heoup ((desk 쾅)
Jimin (Survival Rival):
Cuteness
=
Is it cute to dance?
=
I didn't know well on stage.
Park Bom got better on this stage.
Please show good stage in the future ♥
=
From Jimin and Cheetah to Unaf
I did this exhibition. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅋㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Park Bom looks like a queen when she first starts
=
This is really cool
=
Cheetah is good, but
I imagined Ciel coming out for the cheetah very briefly.
I miss you 2ne1
=
Wow. Solka Park Bombom is much better .. ㅋㅋ
=
Wow, it made the Summoner dog look pretty, but is it the fifth place?
=
Real stage grip is incredible. My skills from my career seem to speak. Thank you for your courage.
=
I don't know how many times I come in to watch this video.
=
It's really cool ... ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I just watched a stage, but I felt like I was in a taxi in the morning
=
It looks like Park Bom Cheetah duet.
=
ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I thought I had a cheetah battle with Jimin ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ cheetah is Jimin's aoa, so I wrote it in the lyrics !! I did this ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Oh Jeon Soyeon
Cheetah is so cute
=
Real Park Bom Bridge ㄹㅇ When I was young, I made a real Park Bom Bridge title.
=
Why is this song fifth? I think it's better than some songs
=
I'm so crazy ㅠ ̑̈ ㅠ ̑̈ ㅠ ̑̈ ㅠ ̑̈
=
Park Bom Sense ... I've got a cheetah ...
=
Park Bom That clothes and makeup are pretty
And the red suit goes really well
=
Ah I miss this ...
=
Why nobody talks about Seung-hee Seunghee Cheetah As soon as I get out of the chair, it's pretty cute 뎈 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Cheetah dog cool ... Look at him.
=
I want you to sing in spring, Choi Ae-gok.
=
Wow you did well
=
Thank you
=
I missed it in the middle I sing that song with a solo.
=
This is fifth place? I don't get it.
=
Lastly, I want to use the logo with my finger .. I don't want to forget more because it seems that TV is trying and don't forget.
=
Wow ... Real Park Bom is bad, but seriously good for artists.
=
If it's really this much, come back to 2NE1
=
Hong Jin Young
=
John Ye
=
It's ridiculous. How is this only the fifth place? ;;
=
I want to express it, but it is a feeling that the body is not following. It has developed a lot, but it will be
=
Oh, it's a fifth place. It's shit.
=
Even though Park Bom came out alone, I'd love to sing Park Bom, as if it were Ciel Dara Minji who filled the stage.
=
Park Bom isn't Vibil Class here. Please come out solo.
=
Wow, the original song seems to be called by black magic witches, but Park Bom is like a maleficent.
Full
=
Arrangement was the best personally. How did you do a group song as a solo song?
=
It's so good as soon as I see you, I'm shocked
1:46 It's not a big deal.
=
I started to love Park Bom after singing this song.
=
2:26 So So Yeon
=
I'm really good at singing ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm the only one coming here to see you Cheetah ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ 죵
=
Why is this 5th place ㅋㅋ I don't understand
=
His voice is really good
=
Oh really cool
=
Shuhwa cute ㅋㅋㅋ To sleep too!
=
I'll forget you woohuhoo ~ I hope you did this part .. TT TT a little sad but arrangement is really good ..
=
2:55 I'm laughing.
=
I hope to see you often on Park Bom TV.
=
ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's really coming .. Please take my heart ,, ❤
=
Is this fifth place?
=
5th nonsense
=
Park Bom alone, if you're out of 2NE1's whole body ... ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
How is this not even at the top
=
Park Bom is a real talent singer
Both ygs will regret it because they missed out on their talents.
=
It's a park spring tone.
=
Oh, the song is really good.
=
Ahhhhhh
=
Cody Makeup Well done
=
What's so cool about cheetahs coming out ...
=
I thought it was spring sister.
=
Personally, I think I did well after the second one, but I don't have a fan base yet.
=
This makeup goes really well together
=
Is this fifth?
=
Park Bom I loved you ... and I still love you
=
I just did one of chakra ^^
=
I'm so cool, confident and lovely. The other participants' groups were so good, but Park Bom was so great at taking control of the stage. How crazy is the stage like this?
=
Park Bom ranked fifth with this skill.
I can't believe it.
=
Evolutions in the game
There's no joke on stage alone.
=
Park Bom comes out here and can compete with the kids because it's solo, so the baby can barely rub it in the park. 2ne1
=
I want to see 2NE1 complete
=
Why do you think I'm talking to YG because Park Bom calls?
=
I'd like to see you pick one soon
=
I don't even remember the original song. It's not enough to cover it really well.
=
When I watch this and change the song, everyone will arrange it
"Oh, it's going to be weird", but everyone was very good at arranging.
=
I think I've been getting a lot of subs ... TT
=
No matter how much I swear, I'm just walking through the flower streets
=
Children: Go away
Park: Get off
=
It would've been nice if CL helped
=
I've felt since 2NE1, but the tone is really queen !!! No one seems to cover it. As I said in the comments, I was worried about the cover song, but this time it was great. Park Bom is very supportive !!
=
It was great to be able to listen to the voices on the air from the first appearance TT TT TT.
=
??....What....?? I was creepy with Mr. Washed with my children. This is a class.
=
How lonely would you miss your members?
=
Oh my god, I'm just eating it, please. Nesui-chan black and black
=
This is the level at which we apologize to human beings.
=
Suddenly, the song becomes classy, ​​I guess it's not an idol song
=
Is this lower than Lovelyz? Idols over there would have grown up with 2ne1.
=
Autotune is planted in the neck. This singer is rare.
=
Honestly, the professional judges are sitting and judged, but I don't even watch the program, and some fans just beat their singers' votes. ㅋㅋㅋ To summon 2NE1 fans, they must be college students even when they are young. I'm talking about idols, but the rankings are still underneath.
=
Steamed yg initial insole;-; It's crazy, really Park Bom itself
=
I want you to just drag 2NE1 and Park Bom 1st place ㅠㅠㅠ
=
This contest itself is also called Pappo and it's too bad for spring. So I hope you don't mind spring. ㅠㅠ Listen to everyone.
=
It seems like it's a stage where I want to say something to a Namju who committed suicide in the music video after 10 years.
=
I think Park Bom's tone is really Segel's unique, so I think each stage is precious.
=
Park Bom fills the stage just by singing without the need
=
As soon as I listened to the first bar, tears just burst out ...
=
The voice is a real treasure when you're overwhelmed by singing without dancing.
=
Park Bom also wanted to show a good stage, so I came out with a big heart. If you want to sing yourself in front of the public and finish it comfortably
=
Park Bom doesn't memorize notes but sings with natural beats.
=
I can't think of a sun song after listening to this song.
=
It's the best Park Bom ever called out of the Queendom.
=
Park Bom doesn't seem to be able to compete. The ranking itself cannot be discussed. No matter the ranking, in Queendom, it's just a thing that makes you listen to your juniors. Thank you for listening to a good song
=
Soul in my voice..Thank you for singing
=
Park Bom's song seems to be nothing but a singer who makes me feel empathy.
=
It's not that i don't do anything. It's not an idol.
=
This song is like Park Bom singing to 2NE1's days.
=
Hey, it's 5th place. It's not queendom but fandom.
=
Wow, I'm the stage. This is the stage. I'm so good. Park Bom ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The ranking is like a fandom board. The ranking of the perforated stage is also very harsh against Park Bom.
=
Sun is also a singer with a unique tone, but it's amazing that Park Bom doesn't think of the original song. I want Park to know that Park Bom doesn't have a low ranking. Queendom was performance-oriented and was also a popular pick when Park Bom and 2NE1 were in full swing. The voice was creepy and the choreographer was also good at expressing eyes and ears. It's a good idea to come back to ballad around winter. Park Bom is an over-the-top artist who just touches his voice and recalls memories.
=
I think every time I see Park Bom, but it seems to be my song no matter who sings
Just make it 'Park Bom Song'
=
I played at the school through this song, but Park Bom sang 2NE1 in Queendom. I was surprised to see that it was sun eyes.
=
As soon as I heard the first bar, the creepy, other people had the least reaction
=
My voice sings like a brand singer, but it's not boring at all.
=
Why did my neck hurt so much?
=
Park Bom is a bit sad. The Queendom system itself is too disadvantageous for Park Bom. Of course the ranking must be low. The Park Bom stages were cool enough so I don't want to be too confident.
=
Ah, I don't see any dance background.
=
When the singers sing other people, I thought of the original song, but Park Bom just became his song.
=
Despite being a solo, the voice and the look that fills the stage is always so cool. ㅠㅠㅠ I am sad today for some reason.
=
I think Mi-yeon was a little strange while listening to that song.
It's not bad. Park Bom or the sun could be the company's senior.
=
Wow, as soon as she started singing, she got creepy.
=
Spring's sister always sings like a song ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I know I'm singing but it seems like I've played the CD. The voice itself is unique, so it's also a sense of stability. It looks good too. It's just like your song.
=
Park Bom's voice that I hear is blowing in the huts, and the sound of ripening and snow is falling.
=
2NE1 on this stage
I hope you see ... The lyrics are ...
=
The songs that Park Bom sings in Queendom I think you're singing while thinking of 2ne1
=
Like Park Bom, it's hard to digest his personality perfectly like that.
=
Real song is so good ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Park Bomman has a feeling ... Do not dwell on the rankings just look forward ㅠㅠ I am doing well enough❤️❤️❤️
=
I can't speak because I'm so good.
=
I'm alone, but I'm really good at working hard ..
It was better because it was a stage that only Orot decorated
=
Mike was the problem too ...
Live so good ;;
=
Park Bom is really Park Bom ...
=
No I don't really know
Why do I cry when I look at the spring stage? If anyone sees it, it looks like a goddamn story.
=
Wow, I really love you
=
Park Bom is the best ..
=
Why doesn't it sound like a 2NE1 story?
=
OMG !!! why am I tearing? This is a heartwarming performance I love her voice ㅠㅠ
=
There's no youtube bug. I really want to talk about Park Bom's song.
=
Park Bom, I want you to sing for a long time.
=
Park Bom reported that this was for 5 again and felt that the Queendom rank was useless. Queendom voting results or field votes seem to be just fandom fights ... No matter how huge the stage is, fandom firepower comes with a low ranking. It seems that the final top level could be used .. In the case of aoa or the year, it was the most talked-about stage of the Queendom stage.
The bottom line is that if you want to get a higher Queendom rank, you'll either have a high fandom, earn a good score penalty from the crew, or create a legendary stage where you'll bend your inwardly bending arm that other fans will have to admit ...
=
I can see spring every week, and I'm so happy to hear spring's song. Thank you for singing. Spring is always your best.
=
Park Bom will have the courage to resume his activities and he will be courageous every time, but every time he is standing alone among the teams, it's all hard and looks awesome.
=
At first, I felt repulsive because of the artificial feeling
Now I have to feel that "Yes, this is sensation!"
=
I'm upset because the ranking is lower every time, but in my mind, I'm always number one. Thank you for listening to good music!
=
If you lived in the same age, you might be thinking the same thing. The reason for the tears and the feeling of the stage will be shared. So is the eye nose.
=
Every time I see Park's stage, I suddenly open the door from behind and imagine CEL, Sandara Park, and Minji.
=
Queendom is implicitly divided according to the level of performance. Even though the rankings are low, everyone knows and cheers for the amazing stage every contest.
=
No. I was at this level. How is it 5th? No matter how much I think about my hair, I don't understand this. Is this important to fandom? I miss the popular 2NE1 time. I am the first in spring wife's mind.
=
When spring first gave me something like a beggar, why don't you carry your own microphone when you sing ballads?
=
This song of Park Bom is like the song of Park Bom of 2NE1, which was shining in the past. It still shines brightly, but at that time, Park Bom was a revolution.
=
Whenever I come to Queendom I think:
No one in this shabby place ...
=
I can see how much I've practiced ... I've got a sore throat. ㅠㅠ In the last contest, let's go to the top with 2NE1 song.
=
Honestly, I think this is the Queen's Legend stage. I think it was the fifth place because of the unit performance score.
=
I was sucked into the real stage watching this
Spring and children
=
Wow, Mike can't pick it up
=
Park Bom is really pretty ....... Park Bom has done a lot of things that haven't been done in the Queendom .. The final stage I want to see 2NE1 ending YG celebrities are Yon Yen's unique Yon Yen bottle. Every week I see something new and so good ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I have a sore throat, but how good it is to get on stage when I have a good neck.
=
Leaving fandom and evaluating your skills and stage.
=
Park spring hair is really long.
=
To see Korean comments, just press the latest comment ..
=
With real SPEECHLESS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
It's so sad to sing and sing the spring vocal vocals of my sister's sincerity.
=
I want to read Korean comments, so I scroll down and write a comment. Park Bom's tone is so good that nobody can follow me and it's so unique.
=
I'm listening to the Park Bom song now, but I'm listening to this song for some reason.
=
Let's come out once, let's show you what the real queen is
=
1:36 Hyojung is cute
=
Pew ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ TT I love you
=
A voice that becomes a song just by reading a book ..
I think it would have been much better if I had a camera like Xia chandelier.
I can't dance. I want to see a song with you.
=
Honestly, it's spring. The rankings are meaningless, but I'm upset. I don't understand why I stay in fifth place.
=
Park feels really hard and sincere about each stage
It really feels great when you watch the video
=
3:40 Saying I love you Park Bom I'm suddenly impressed .. Ha.
=
Park Bom seems to miss a lot of old days.
=
But my nose is originally a high range, suddenly the sound is so high that even difficult to match.
=
Ha .... Chubby Park Bom ㅠㅠ ㅡ ㅡ ㅡ ㅡ ㅋ ㅋㅠㅠ ❤️❤️
=
I started as an idol, but now as a mature musician ...
It's often used to say that a woman has a han ...
I felt like a woman roaring, holding a han and taking it.
I really feel like something hit my head hard ...
Park Bom ...
=
When I listen to my heart, tears come out ....
=
Really beautiful voice
=
It's totally creepy
=
# 5 I'm the best in spring!
=
I'm just listening to a song, tears Uh ... that's ... uh that voice ...
=
Park Bom is the best, but Park Bom's voice reminds me of those old memories so you can just call anything.
=
I'm a solo solo and I'm not good at the performance score, but Park Bom's ranking is important.
=
Spring is freezing! ♡
=
If I sing Park Park, I keep tears and why
=
Wow .. how do real people don't dance, just sit and sing and overwhelm the stage with one voice? Park Bom, I really love you
=
I have all the skills I have top class, but it's too bad to get undervalued here.
=
3:56 Scary Moon
=
As the juniors sneak and saw, I too dazed and saw ㅠㅠ real suction power and mole was hard.
=
It's a legend
=
Mic
=
If I go alone, I will pentakill even if I go 2 to 1 completely.
=
Park Bom's sister is so cool
I loved it since kindergarten .. I still have a bad voice.
I can't forget it. I really love you.
=
Park Bom's song is so good that I'm so good at empathy.
=
朴 春 姐姐 是 永遠 的 第一名 吖 ㅠㅠ
=
Why are you sad to listen to the song?
=
This is my favorite song.
=
The song lyrics call for a farewell lover, but Park Bom seems to sing to the past.
=
I can't see Koreans. I want to read Korean comments, but please give me a lot. But Park Bom's hair would be stuck. It's really long.
=
Wow .. Really .. Multiplying legends to complete ㅠㅠ Park Bom needs the title after the legend ㅠㅠ The title of more than Queen suits Park Bom.
=
It's like Park Bom song.
=
Suddenly because of the dancer's face
=
Oh really crazy. So much
=
When spring said, I was completely thirsty.
Still good at singing
=
No, I was really crying all the time I listened ... Even though Park Bom was so perfect, it was so wonderful .. TT TT I'm really the number one in my heart :) I'm not a fan, but I'm still cheering. I hope you came out
=
Park Bomman's singing power is so good
=
ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ The song feels so sad
=
Why aren't you talking about?
=
This legend
=
Park Bom's eyes nose feels very sad because it feels goodbye to the group called 2ne1 .. When I just heard it, I couldn't think of anything except 2NE1. .......
=
Really cool ...
=
Sister Park
=
Spring Sister Aircraft ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I'm an artist who handles music with a natural voice
=
It's not really a crazy spring tone.
I can't but I can see the various charms of Park Bom so nice ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ 영원한 Eternal No. 1 in my heart
=
My dog's feet are crazy.
=
It's hard to sing.
=
You have a lot of sensitivity as a back dancer., Lol
=
Even though I'm a big fan, as soon as I call Park Bom's first verse ...
=
Her voice is very angelic and I love her so much Queen Queen Stan.
=
I love you so much
=
Park Bom's eyes are so steering
=
It seems like Park Bom's vocal cords are crowded with breathing and voices come with breathing.
=
Tears ...
=
I'm so sad I want to see 2NE1 ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Park Bom, is there any vocal cord nodules?
=
Thank you so much for coming back to Park Bom who loved me so much
=
It's a Pandora's box, but it's not a stage that fans love, but a stage that makes everyone a fan. I love you.
=
Great work !! ^ _ ^ Bom has put 5 songs on the "Billboard World Digital Song Sale" chart this year 2019. Surely, it is a great achievement. Particularly considering she just came back after long hiatus and she is a solo (not a group member anymore). These is no Korean solo vocalist putting 5 songs on the chart. Indeed, there are even no Korean female groups putting 5 songs while there are three male idol groups. Nonetheless, I feel sorry. I would say that this song should also have been listed, too !! Park Bom posted five songs on the Billboard World Digital Sound Chart during this year, and it is a pity that the songs are not included in the five songs. Park Bom is the only Korean solo singer who has uploaded more than five songs. There is no team. This is the only female singer who has posted five songs on the Billboard digital music sales chart this year.
=
It's good, but I hear something heart? Feeling frustrating ㅠㅠ I don't think it's very good.
=
It's so cool, I like it so much
=
This song is the best sounding crushed ...
=
I think I'm calling it to CL ...
If it was me, I would be fierce on the stage
It's really important to control your emotions on stage.
2ne1 I really liked it ... I don't want to call it memories.
=
2ne1 Big Bang they can't follow
=
^^ ..... You won't have to be No.1 to Y & I, Han, and Eye Nose ㅠㅠ Really ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠㅜ ㅜㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's been 444, but it's too bad to be a candidate.
=
Huh ㅠㅠ Spring sister sings so good, I'm dancing next to the man, I'm tears, I feel sad and hear a lot of old thoughts, and other people will not hear spring sisters and I can't sing, I love spring sisters! ^^
=
Usually when I cover or remake a song, I sometimes think of the original song, but Park Bom was 'Park Bom's eyes and nose' so much that I can't think of the sun.
=
I don't care about the rankings
=
Oh....!!! Brother Hanseon!
=
I cried. Spring is strong ~ !!!!
=
When other participants did, they reacted to it, but in spring, they didn't say a word until the end.
=
It sounds great
=
I wasn't interested in 1 during the 2NE1 heyday, but I went to the Park Boon stage and looked at the old Tuenny One stage.
=
Real Park Bom really squeezes all vocals ㅠㅠ How to convey feelings in a song like that ... Park Bom really is the best ... Spring sister really love you all the time
=
Dancer acting crazy ...
=
Oh my god
=
It was really creepy and so good, but the 5th place was an incredible stage. It's too bad because it's a lower level .. ㅠㅅㅠ Park Bom ....
=
I didn't see Queendom if I didn't have spring.
=
Live is better than the sound source ㅠㅠ Thank you for being a singer ㅠㅠ
=
Crazy ... ♥ ︎
=
The fans who shake the middle blackjack together come out why is it so ㅠㅠ With a voice of spring sister
=
It's art.
=
Wow, I think Park Bom is really great .. I didn't think of the sun all the time and listened to the Park Bom song. Then, I thought the lyrics were like this.
=
Looks lonesome ... Really 2ne1
=
Park Bom voice should I ...? Why do you think it changed ..? It feels like a tuk-tuk.
=
It was just creepy to the first measure !! Awesome
=
Park's tone is unique
=
Opened.
=
It's not a real idol, but a unique tone among Korean singers.
=
Park Boom over Joa ~~
=
Tears from the introduction
=
When I see the stage of Park Bom, tears or just .. 50,000 emotions come true. Sister who spent my school days together ㅠㅠ Whenever I see Queendom, I look shrunk and look lonely and lonely. As a 10-year-old fan,
It was always on the top, so it was a big deal. At least for me, it's always No. 1 without any contest ranking. Let's play ~~
Please don't dwell on the ranks
If you collect blackjack, it's game end ㅠㅠ Inevitably this is a fandom fight. situation
If this is a singer, I'll sing first.
(Real-time text ballot, Blackjack gather right now ㅠㅠ ෆ)
=
Wow ... it's really creepy.
=
Dancer's thumb body, Han Suncheon
=
The tone is ...
=
Park Bom is a hard-to-find dog with a unique charm popping voice instead of a lot of throat and emotional ups and downs ... but even after many years of singer life can not help it
=
I'm crying
=
Today I am healing because of my sister.
=
Park Bom I'm so good, but it's too sad to compete with the teams alone in this competition. Isn't it right for teams to compete solo against each other?
=
Spring❤
=
I don't even see a queen. But if you see the Park Bom's stage video on Youtube,
=
Spring sister ❤️ I want to see a lot of singing songs ㅎㅎ I want you to unite once.
=
I thought I'd sing Park Park for a long time
I still sing well
=
It was just a memory of Park Bom and I was impressed. Thank you.
=
There are a lot of people who feel bad about Park Bom, but I think it goes better with this song
It's sad because people who cried a lot are calling
=
No, how is this fifth place?
=
Honestly, there are too many disadvantages for Bom, so I have to take it all alone, but it's a pity for the fans to watch it. On-site voting is almost a fandom fight, so it's a bit more unfortunate than the active idol groups. There's no one to discuss the stage with, I have to sing all the songs from the beginning to the end, and I don't have any members, so I have to solve the unit stage myself.
=
As soon as I sang the first creepy creepy ...
=
And develops a real tone
=
It's 2ne1's Park Bom. Anytime, someday, 4 people will be able to meet again someday ... My life girl group 1st place 2ne1
=
I want to know what the votes are all about ... After all, it seems like it's a fandom fire.
=
Park Bom's voice is like Teddy's song
=
Wow ... I applied it with singing and tone ...
=
That's when the man walks.
=
I'm sorry for dancing, but my eyes are so burdensome
=
It is so sad that Park Bom is fifth. It was the first place in my heart. It was a bit sad but it went so well and it was like a sister's song. I was forced to give 6th place without the unit's private stage and it was too disadvantageous. You look so hard to be alone. Tomorrow new song is going to hit
=
Wow ... I heard it so well ~
=
It's a real ugly dog.
=
Park Bom, please don't be hard even if you lower the rank.
=
I will always support you ~~!
=
5th-5th-5th? Does this make sense ...
=
Like your voice hurt a lot.
=
Did your face change?
=
Tone is a real national treasure
=
I was a real fan of 2ne1 when I was in elementary school, but it's been a long time since I remembered it. Blackjack Panbong is so nice at 1:48 !!!
=
i'm crying rn
=
Is ranking important? It's Park Bom's voice that rang me in 24 years.
=
The song is awesome and Park Bom's unique voice is so good
=
good...
=
I remember that Park Bom was going to be an yg trainer later.
=
It's legendary ...
=
Appreciation
=
This is really awesome ... Park Bom's tears after the UN Eye Story.
=
Park Bom is Queen.
..
=
I can't think of a performer who can fill that stage alone like Park Bom .. The tone itself is over .. Unique. Oh, it's really tight
=
As the real Queendom progresses, it's like Park Bom who is totally alone in 2 Anyone Park Bom. Please give me a sad song.
=
Spring is just a treasure ...
=
No. Why is your sister fifth?
=
You're so cool ~
=
Honestly, Queendom itself is a high performer if you're good at popo, so you're alone and older Spring is not good for you.
=
I think Park Bom always sings to her heart
=
Empathy is visible in every song lyrics .. 2ne1 I miss you so much .... I'll wait for the stage of 4 people to come again.
=
I like your voice (
=
Is it just me feeling stuffy?
=
I want to tie the camera guy
=
I miss you so much.
=
I wanted to see your stage and I'm happy to see you and I want to see your stage. Thank you for the stage so far.
=
It hurts so much but now you
I'll call it memories
=
Park Bom seems to have a great meaning in doing what he wants to do.
=
That male dancer is not Han Han Chun?! ??? > _ <
=
The real queen is Park Bom TT Why do geniuses have a hard life?
=
And crying at the stage ...
=
As soon as I hear the first bar, I think I'll be in tears TT TT I really only have this voice ... Park sing for ten million years ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I think it's my eye contact
=
Legend is still a legend ...
=
Thank you for singing again
=
But Park Bom's voice is not so bad .....? ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Too bad to be honest ㅠㅠ Regardless of the result is the most unfortunate that I did not hear the best sound of spring is the best voice state If it is the best prank or not ????? TT
=
If you go to pansori like this, it looks good. I love listening
=
Park Bom ... I need to call it tickle
=
Park Bom's sister was bad in pronunciation in the old days, but I've practiced a lot .... I'll understand everything even if I don't see the lyrics.
=
Self color can be saved good song selection
=
I'm not Park Bom Generation, but I hope it's good
=
Queendom itself is called Park Bom
Solo performance is weak compared to other groups, or you have to watch the game with unique singing skills.
=
When I first started, I looked sideways and looked like an old Spring sister
Over pretty
2NE1 I really liked it.
I was so happy to see the same girl.
Its unique voice and ingenuity are good
The pronunciation is a little ... well, but the conclusion
It is considered disadvantageous in Queendom. Everyone is a group;
Filling out the big stage by yourself is so difficult
=
Did you turn on Autotune?
=
Wow, but I'm really good at singing.
=
It's not hot, but it's very hairy,
=
5.7 million likes but no less than 700 is really great ...
=
To be honest, Park Bom sat still and sang, but it was okay to put a little more Han Han Chun
Waiting for Han Seon-cheon
=
Dancing 9 Han Seon Chun
=
YG's song is very good for Park Bom
=
I look at this every spring, but even if the rank is low
=
Park Bom-age, an 8-year-old kid who works and lives, but I think there are a lot of people who can't go to Queendom to cheer him. The voice is so good and so talented that I keep singing. Increase your viewer vote rankings!
=
Can't you join again?
=
No, but I don't think it's going to go up all the way, it hurts my neck too much.
=
I love Park Bom's qualities and unique emotions because they are so unique. The ringing itself is amazing ...
=
Sister Chegoya
=
Pak Bom Sister Return
=
I recognized that the dancer is Han Seoncheon in 1 second.
=
Wow, it goes well with Park Bom's voice. It's like Park Bom,
=
It's a shame that the eyes, nose and mouth arrangements are poor due to Park Bom's quality.
The slower, faster change of tempo
Too bad, just like reading a Korean book.
My score is stellar, and I want to be more excited.
=
Park Bom is cool !!
=
Wow..........
=
I don't know everything, but every time I hear the Park Bom song,
=
Your throat is not zero ...
=
Spring is doing well
=
I don't like seeing the kids over and over !!!
=
She is alone, but fills the stage every time she sings. This is a legend. Park Bom is a legend
Even though she's alone, she fills the stage everytime she sings. This is a legend. Park Bom is legend.
=
Tone art
=
I'm not a singer in the '90s or early' 00s, but my throat is already gone.
=
Uh, dancing people ... who's not on the thumb body?
=
I thought half the sun wouldn't follow.
It's so good because my voice is so different ㅠㅠ
=
Creepy creepy
=
Promote the new song, so many of the treble and was it too hard ... ㅠㅠ ..
But Park Bom-chan is the one who filled the stage with vocals alone.
My heart hurts so much because I think I keep paying attention to the rankings ...
It's always number one for fans ...
Thank you for singing.
=
Mamamu + black pink + children <2ne1 come back please ~
=
It's a singer too.
=
I love you
=
Why are the other singers' reactions so awkward?
=
Sister ......... sing forever
=
Isn't Han Seon-chun who appeared on that guy's thumb body 1?
=
I don't think this song shows the goodness of Park Bom ...
But I hope you don't forget that Park Bom is Park Bom and Legend
I love you Park Bom
I will always support you ㅎㅎ
=
I'll cry when I call you memories
=
I was sad because the song lyrics felt like words to fans and members.
=
Trot...
=
Pronunciation, falsehood ;;
=
There's a hand gesture at 0:30, but no gesture at 0:41.
=
Park Bom Cheer
=
Park Bom is a little uncomfortable.Improvement of voice. Anxiety. Anxiety. An anxiety of its own. Impressive but complete. Anxiety. I can't help if there is a problem with my ear. But Park Bom has to be treated a little too.
=
I'm special at every stage in spring ... just singing that breathing expression.
=
Cheer up! Park Bom fighting
=
After all, who is returning to Park Bom's return of legend?
=
I feel like I went back to middle school when I heard the songs ... I can't remember who I was. I'm cold. Be careful of the cold and let me listen to the songs for a long time.
=
I feel every time I watch Mnet, but I'm good enough even if I don't do anything. I want to set the rankings and have a sense of competition ... I don't care about the rankings and care for my favorite children.
=
You were in the dancer thumb body.
=
3:54 4:08 Queendom to be honest
=
Han Seon-cheon and Park Bom are not really kidding,
=
My sister is the best
=
I'm calling you well.
=
I'm watching because of Park Bom. I think you should see a unique stage with one voice between groups. I want to see you more often. Fighting!!!
=
It's like a song that thinks of the past ... "I'll call it memories."
=
Wow
=
So good
=
There's too much facial expression in the man behind.
=
Is that guy's thumb body?
=
Honestly, I see it because of Queen Park Park Bom, I'm not interested in Rank 1 I just want Park Bom to be on stage
=
It's a great voice, but I can't help being annoyed with your face TT TT Why did you do it?
=
It's not from the real tone.
=
I always miss Park Bom's voice.
=
There is something ringing in Park Bom song.
=
Park Bom ... I feel as I sing, but I think I'm missing 2NE1 members ...
=
Is it a dancer?
=
It's so full of heart and it's going to tears soon.
=
Every stage is precious
=
I filled the stage with one voice.
Don't be too dignified by the rankings. You're still the best.
=
Park Bom .. even if you make a voice
=
I only listened to 2NE1 songs when I was going to school. It's already been 7 years and 8 years ago.
=
Entering YG is a big life turnaround
=
The song is good ~ But the neck condition feels bad ~~ It wasn't like this at the last revert stage ~~~ I keep listening to both songs ^^
=
Park Bom is so good that you eat 99 out of 100 with one voice.
=
I like Park Bom's voice and it's a voice that lets me feel my emotions
=
2ne1 ...
=
Why is this the fifth place ... I don't understand why Park Bom stays in fifth place ...
=
Was this sad lyrics? I'll see you again ...
=
Why is my breath shaking? I was nervous
=
Koreans gather here
Park Bomman's tone goes with any song.
=
Now, one of the main vocals in the Queendom group comes out solo and confronts Park Bom.
=
The tone is not good at Park Bom.
=
Park Bom 1 won the fire with 2NE1's body or Kwon Ji Yong's duet.
=
I doubted the eye looking at the title. Please assign me a voice national treasure. Thank you so much for singing. Thank you so much for being a singer. I'm dying ... ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Oh really ... Why are you going out there and being humiliated? Even though I'm upset. Thank you so much for singing so much. I'm sorry.
=
exactly
YG's song is really sticky ... Chegoda Queendom I'm alone because there's no performance and fandom is relatively low
=
Spring sister
=
I feel like I've been struggling to sing all the time without a break all year round. People who know that they try twice as much as others because of the lyrics. If you had a little rest ^^ And Chanel Park Bom voice best ^^
=
Last time I'll call it Memke Sad ... It's like I'm talking about 2NE1. I was sad when 2NE1 was with me. I became an adult and I can't go back.
It's good to be a memory but sad
I hope you'll come back.
=
Spring is the best
=
Since I was a child, the YG family has been a favorite YG-Pasoon. Among them, the Park Bom-voice was my favorite voice. It's also unstable and the pronunciation has been common in previous competitions and I feel that Park Bom's calling too much ㅠㅠ Rather than just lowering the tempo a little better, and I personally wanted to show Han's dance like this. (It's not that Han Seon-Chan's dance was wrong, but Mnet was kicking a light or a camera.)
=
The tone is not behind anyone!
=
The real vocal cord is the electronic vocal cord.
=
Since last time, Park Bom seems to have recorded the wrong sound.
=
I was surprised to resemble dancer Gwanghui
=
You're not hurt by the result!
It is a natural result to play against a group of idols with fandom!
You can just say that I'm a singer in front of people in a proud song!
My sister's eye nose sounds different so I think it was a better stage !!
I'm always cheering!
It's spring sister fighting.
=
Male dancer
=
It's always like to sing while chopping each lyrics. I don't throw away the lyrics one by one
=
You're good at singing Park Bok, but I'm getting a lot more breathing than usual because the song is getting faster and faster.
But it was a little unfortunate that I didn't see modern dance well
=
Park Bom's hair extension is amazing
=
I love you ♡
=
And the day when I hear this song with Park Bom's voice is coming ...
=
All the stages were good but I always liked Park Bom but it's a pity that the program itself is too bad for Park Bom.
=
It's cool
It's my favorite song.
Another feeling ~~ It was great ^ ♡ ^
=
Even though there is no movement, goose bumps
=
https://youtu.be/ITugQUhu2gY Try the direct cam version without correction
It's a real legend
=
Park Bom is really crazy.
=
Was the pronunciation of Park Bom originally like this?
=
Separate
Why is the song so nervous
=
Why is it so sad Why is it so sad that the idols of my childhood were singing with voices like this?
=
Crazy
=
I hope you come out
=
Looks hard
=
It's too hard to sing alone. I can't see my voice trembling and breathing. Y & I was really good
=
It was a chicken that stretched from my arms to my legs.
=
Isn't the dancer Han Sun Chun ??
=
Miss 2ne1
=
I voted for my girl, but what's the point of doing it? ... Everyone, regardless of first place, finds the color of their own group and shows the infinite possibilities of their group, finds their way and finds their way. I can't decide who's first.
=
Isn't the window method strange? Mongaderang + thicker voice also makes you feel uncomfortable. The habit of raising notes at the end of measures
=
Park Bom I'm nervous ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ But I can only ㅠㅠ ㅠ other competitors are all groups, it's a big burden to fill that big stage alone.
=
I want to see the stage, but it's like an anti-horsepower test for every man.
=
This song is like .. 2NE1 and fans think it's a memory now .. I'm upset. I think it would have been better if I slowed down the tempo.
=
pharmacy
=
If you haven't experienced 2NE1 Series, you'll hear Park Bom's voice and don't know why people like it.
=
Park Bom is Park Bom ...
=
Male dancer? Isn't Han Sun Chun who came out with Thumb Body?
=
The clothes I wore this time look best and are pretty
=
My throat tunes
=
No modern dance lighting Why did you do that?
=
I loved Park Bom
=
The song is so sad, but I stayed at the end and looked at it
=
How does a person get that tone?
Real national treasure
=
The real voice is nostalgic and the tone is unique.
=
Isn't male dancer Han Seoncheon ??
=
Honestly, the idol contest is a fandom fight ... no matter how bad the stage is, the chances of being put on a popular vote are very high.
=
Park Bom sings one song alone and the other teams share parts, which is too unfair.
=
Can't Mike do this? What should I say? I don't think it's bad. It feels like I've been cut off in the old days. It's still a great singer, so it's still good. But it's a shame from an old fan.
=
Your voice must have rested. Your voice has rested.
=
Surely because of vocalization
My neck hurt a lot and it's hard to come back.
It looks like the caustic is not coming out at all
Park Bom I thought it was unique since YG, but it hurts as a long time fan.
=
Play with me katok tdw200
=
As a person of thumb body, I would be funny if someone who danced is Hansuncheon.
=
Park Bom's voice is really unusual. It's a single person's voice, but it sounds like a chord
=
I'm Park Bom that's a patent with good sounding and eating (?) Speech.
=
Why is it so hard to sing? I think I breathed too much ...? I'm out of breath
=
The original song is a love song, but Park Bom is like his past song.
=
Performance with one voice
=
You are the best
=
I want to marry Park Bom.
=
Strange When I first heard it was a pity, but the more I hear, the more I get lost. I guess this is Park Bomman's soul music. Listening to Park Bom's vocals, I think of him as a natural genius. Various sounds that cannot be arranged are cooked freely with brilliant soul technique. I was so dizzy when I first heard this song. As soon as I listened to the scarecrow, I wanted to call it more clearly than I was indulged in Park Bom's soul vocals. However, as I listen to it over and over, I find that it was just because I wasn't able to accept Park Bom's vocals. I am lucky and happy to know a singer named Park Bom.
=
The harmony of Park Bom's song and Han Sun Chun's dance is real .. ㅠㅠ Wow .. The stage tears at all times .. TT Too salty but touches the heart. TT
=
Tone really awesome ....
=
This is 5th place .. doesn't it make sense?
=
As soon as I listened to this first bar
=
Wow ... sing a song ...
=
The secret from Park Bom's voice and the unique method of creation was the best because the sad feelings blended well with this selection.
=
Real voice utterance is unique
=
I hope you don't care about the rankings !!! Whatever the ranking, the stage is always great.
=
The tone is a bit chewy but it's a pity to breathe. Because the breath is broken, the pronunciation is a little crushed.
=
Isn't the hair heavy?
=
I feel bad for my throat, but it's better because it mixes with spring sound.
It would be great if Park Bom sang this song other than the sun.
It's so hot
=
I can't do anything when I listen
Park Bom really sounds good.
=
Yg song is so strong that only the same yg singer can cover it.
=
The tone is similar to Kim Sumi.
=
Of course I thought it would be number one, but I'm more sorry, I'm relatively alone.
=
If you just hear Park Bom's voice, it's a perfume bottle
=
The stage is full alone.
=
However, in retrospect, there was no group like 2ne1 Big Bang.
=
I always love you, No. 1 Spring, I love you, I'm always No. 1, I love you, love you, love you
=
Do you think that the microphone is weird?
=
Wow .... If there is an original author, it can't go beyond that. The law of immutability is ... Awkward and not strange at all.
=
I hope you will stay forever as an artist
=
You and i in the MV in the hospital, the main character finally died and can not see again .. I will call it memories.
=
I think it's why I'm singing 2NE1's old days. Your black-eyed lyrics that only looked at me. Something like that. It seems like Park Bom has the power to evoke memories. Too much immersion. I think that's why it's called memories. It's also a different meaning.
=
I don't know how many creepy times
=
Park Bom I hurt my voice
=
Prove the number of comments ... I'm alone.
=
Queendom sees because of Park Bom
=
Make-up like a bridegroom on a man's ghost bride
=
Park Bom is always number one for me.
=
The sound of McMont Bom's call to listen to the sounding of the sound is pronounced, and how pronounced it is; the spring sounds like this style, but you can see how well it compares. Spring haircut might sound awkward
I think it's natural for spring style from overseas artist vocals.
=
I've been a fan of 2NE1 since ancient times, but it seems a lot harder to sing than before. ㅠㅠ Is it just me .. I can't pronounce it well.
=
The sound is not so good, but spring is not good for your sister.
=
I'm just trying to mold
=
It looks sore throat It looks so hard ㅠㅠ What is the story? Why are the idols watching the stage cry?
=
ㄹㅇ Park Bom Another singer sings I can't think of the original song ... Magic
=
It's Hanseoncheon
=
Please keep singing without worrying about ranking
=
Park Bom no.1
=
It's more than a feeling that conveys feelings. Every time my spring sister sings, I'm really creepy. My sister is really good for us. Man's soul is so good. Thank you and I love you.
=
Park Bom sings first
=
Honestly, I've been to 2NE1 since I saw this Queendom.
=
Why does it sound like pansori ???
=
Park Bom I love you always cheer up
=
No one can follow the Park Bom
=
Why is it that my heart hurts ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Scarecrow did it, and it seems like there's something crying and crying ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
3:57 Dancer look funny.
=
I really love you so much TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TTT
=
The tone is so good
=
3:58 Like Hwang Kwang-hee and Kwak Yoon-gi ...
=
It was a stage where empathy was really good. Thank you so much.
=
Even today I'm spring sister
I feel like I miss you again
I miss this
I think it looks like that
=
Really impressive and fantastic
=
I feel like I have a bad throat ㅠㅠㅠ Daa ~ When you look hard ㅠㅠㅠ I practiced a lot ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom's awesome ♡
=
It's really addictive ...
=
It's a great spring tones ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I love you park boom❤️
=
Did you have a bad day ...? ㅠㅠㅠ I have a sore throat ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ But nevertheless good ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Thank you so much for singing.
=
Male dancer facial smoke is clear .. Real creepy
=
Thank you so much for doing this! It's a touching song. I'm looking forward to singing the best of Park Bom! Don't worry about rankings.
=
Really smart
=
I'm crazy, Park Bom. I'm a geeky man. I'm dead. I love Park Bom.
=
Tone crazy real
=
You're Han Seon-chun, who's on that body of dancer. I thought you looked a lot like Han Sun Chun but you were right ..
=
I'll cheer for Park Bom I'm doing well ^^
=
Park Bom is not enough to see MC in Queendom at first ... ?? It's a gap gap.
=
I can't let you go Why I'm so sad in Igasa ㅠㅠㅠ 2NE1 I really miss you ㅠㅠㅠ
=
There are a lot of musically great in the comments. Please point out the singers who are ^^ Park Bom fighting! ^^
=
I listened to the first bar but it was creepy when I remembered the old days of Big Bang and 2ne1.
=
Oh my hair is long.
=
I love you...
=
Queendom makes a lot of legends
=
It's a bit unfortunate that the neck is not the same, but Park Bom's tone is still unique.
=
Dah ~~! I have to go up like this ... Daha .... um ?? mmm ?? ... I didn't have a good condition ..
=
It's like a park song
=
Hancheon John-cool
=
Everyone was impressed. Other singers' expressions
=
Park Bom is a legend
=
Park Bom thinks it's great to fill the stage with one voice alone.
=
The only voice in Korea is Park Bom ..
=
It's a bit fast, but I can't think of the sun like it was a spring song.
=
Park Bom clearly said that the dance of modern dance was sad, so it was well expressed and I had to watch both the song and the dance. Why do you keep taking the modern dance?
Spring sisters have a real point of dancing, but I don't think how to shoot
=
Please, please do not hesitate at any time please please 4 people together ... tt tt blackjack is waiting for that day. What's your sister's tone?
=
Wow Park sings this song
=
Korean Comments To show a lot of comments
=
Park Bom Chang is uncomfortable to listen to, but I don't like it ... The stage is always crying.
=
It's not just one of the competition programs, but I think I just came to Park Bom Concert ...
=
I don't know how much you're doing alone by spring sister. I'm so proud.
=
YG representative female vocalist Park Bom sings a typical YG style song with a click on the title, so, can't expect to sing
=
I think it's something for 2NE1 fans, not their own fans.
I felt the love of the fans at that time and I feel it well now, but now I stand alone, I feel like I am going to leave my 2NE1 fans as memories and stay well with Park Bom itself.
=
Honestly, if you look at the song only the first and second place ..
=
Wouldn't it be better to chew everything if 2NE1 came back again? There would be great memories for the fans and once again for 2NE1.
=
After 4 minutes, the man approaching Park Bom is overlooked.
=
I feel sorry for Park Bom's neck.
=
I don't want to fill the stage at Park Bom Honji.
=
The stage was really full, the singer is a singer
=
Oh so sad ...
=
Crazy ...
=
My nose is good, but I think it would have been higher if I had 2NE1.
=
I want you to come out 2ne1 for Park Bom's death.
=
Molding eyes nose lol
=
Someone who was dancing was born and you were very good.
=
Wow, they make a song their own.
=
Really good
=
You should be cool while watching the stage. I want this as a singer
=
The beat is too distracted by the song, and I can't concentrate more on dancing.
I'm sorry
=
Spring sister is the best !!
=
Why are you crying?
=
Isn't she a concert? I want to go..
=
I creepy at the first measure
=
This is a dancer.
=
Park Bom is so cool.
I'm the 1st place in my heart ♥
=
20191026
good..
=
Park Spring Best Real
=
This is how sweet potatoes are made.
=
creeps......
=
Is your throat bad? ㅠ It feels different from the past ㅠㅠㅠ Song that featured when I debuted Big Bang, Park Bom's song When I first heard it, it wasn't like this
=
Wow....
=
It goes well with the song
=
Park Bom's eyes with the color of Park Bom's eyes.The nose and mouth. Park Bom, who has to perform the Queen's stage alone, feels uncomfortable.
=
Queen comeback
=
No, it didn't go first True story
=
I'm tears in my favor. . . . ..
=
Goosebumps from the first measure ...
=
Hyojung, I'm cheering with my two hands together.
=
Still, it was a girl group that once took the top of Korea. Now it's too salty to see all the girls scattered alone and compete alone with other junior girl groups.
=
I don't know why tears come when Park Bom sings.
=
It's so cool ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅗ
=
The only thing that beats the stage with songs is Park Bom
=
If it was not a contest but a sound recording, it would have been a high rank. I hope you don't get too involved in the rankings. I really enjoyed it.
=
Park Bom is a Singer This is a singer. I'm not hit by idols these days because it's a unique voice.
=
Dance line was like a dancer Hanseoncheon, but it was Hanseoncheon Dancing 9 Cat Ba What ;;;
=
Please take care of your neck.
It's the best ...
=
I've practiced too much or my neck hurt too.
=
Wow ... it sings really well ...
=
It looks hard .. The tone is the best.
=
Going to the end is so good.
=
I am so happy that I am creepy
Please sing as much as you want. ㅠ Forever I will remain as blackjack ㅠㅠ
=
Solo alone ~~~ I sang well ~ Pair ~~ Park Bom fighting! ♡
=
0:36 My reaction
=
Park Bom! Don't dwell on my rankings! ❤
=
I didn't know this song was sad
good
=
Wow!
=
I was impressed to see the room! You listened to me
=
Handsome dancer
=
I'm anxious
=
ㅅ ㅈㅎㅂ ㅂㅈㄴ ㅁㅅㄱ
=
It was a bit unfortunate contest. Something that Park Bom's 100% charm did not come out. I feel bad. ㅠㅠ
=
The makeup has changed a bit, the face looks more natural and pretty.
=
It's like a song to two scattered 2ne1 ..
=
As soon as I saw her first spring, she didn't say anything until the end of the song.
=
I thought you were Hong Jin-young
=
I can't breathe too much because I sing a song too quickly ...
=
I'm sorry to be frowned on, but Queendom itself seems to be unfavorable for Park Bom, who was solo. Park Bom likes it because he feels like a lyrical han in his voice.
(Park Bom's hair changed in Daju, but she was pretty ....
=
It's a singular song with a real voice.
❤️❤️
=
I forgot the song for the moment.
=
I'm a little disappointed to see if I'm singing this song, but it's so good to hear the spring version of my eyes.
=
2NE1 Imagine what the whole body sings.
=
I really tears ㅠㅠ Good job I love you Park Bom
=
Phew, it's a shame, but when it was spring, it was a tone live, but now I'm breathing
=
I'm surprised
=
Because of the vocalization, there is a bunch to listen to comfortably .. Because of the contact with the vocal cords and the end treatment with the force, the caustic transition is more difficult. I hope you will be lower .. !! ♡
=
The best part of this stage is two consecutive times from 2:43 to 2:48! It's the best number. This impromptu element is Park Bom's soul music. From now on, it's going to be flawless for a while, and it's a hog river (what's going on? Because of this dazzling ability, I could put five songs on the "Billboard World Digital Song Sale" chart in just eight months as soon as I came back after a long absence with only vocals without dancing. Of course, the only solo singer in Korea is BTS, TXT, SuperM. What a great singer Park Bom is?> _ <It wasn't just a legend legend. The quality of the Queendom, which requires new training and a short time to practice, has not kept the quality consistent, but the dazzling vocals in the second half of the first half keep watching here and live. The sound source listens to it as much as it does, but there are some brighter parts of the live.
=
3:57 And I almost throw my cell phone.
=
Honestly, there is no real tone like Park Bom ㅠ No matter how similar singers are coming out, Park Boum tone is really unique
I miss you so much.
=
The lyrics are sad because Park Bom says
=
Blackjack loves you so much
=
I feel heartfelt in every stage. I know how desperate I love you.
=
Park or not Queendom
=
I miss spring.
=
Creepy tone ㅠㅠ Park Bom ㅠㅠ Thank you for coming back
=
Wow, keep coming creepy
=
I'm really curious about Park Bom song Why are you singing ...? ... It's so unusual.
=
The tone .. The feelings are really overwhelming. ;;
=
This was also a camera director.
=
Park spring is so good
I hope you won't be disappointed as a result.
I think Queendom is an inevitable fandom fight.
Don't worry because your sister is better than anyone in my eyes.
Thank you for listening to good songs
Please keep singing, cheer up, sister ♥ ️
=
Park Bom, you're so good ~~ You've struggled ~~>. <
=
The Park Bom song is so good and the tone is so good
=
I don't really understand it.
What do idols do when spring gets their eyes on their eyes?
=
No, I want to focus on the stage, but Park Bom once, Dancer once, Bumseokseok once, Idol once again. Why are you doing so many transitions?
=
Why can't anyone tell me about Hancheon?
=
You might think it's hard, but I'm really surprised that Park Bom doesn't hear any breath at all
After the song measures, I can hear the sound of the inhale (?), But I think it sounds like live, but there is no breath at all, so I thought it was a lip sync. But it turns out that it's live, so it's 9 times if you've been hit by
=
I can listen to Park Bom's song more intensively through the Queendom, and this song was so good.
=
That guy's thumb body or not there?
=
Huh, there's a back dancer, Somebody 1
=
I think this song is a song that 2ne1 misses well, but the original song Sun was singing so well but I think Park Bom sang well enough .. And I miss 2NE1 while listening to this.
=
It's a tremendous talent to be able to fill the stage with just a few years after getting tired.
=
Thanks to Queendom, it's so nice to see my sister's various stages like this, but it seems like the Queen's rank is low, and everyone's team fights, but I'm really nervous every time I see you. I'm a big fan of you, I love you Park Bom❤️❤️❤️
=
Hansencheon ,,, ㅔ
=
Why am I so hard to hear?
=
I'm always watching well, I wake up, I look up, I always see and fall asleep even before I go to bed It's so good Thank you so much for coming back and I want you to be with us Please don't swear, I hope you live a good life
=
Dancer and Spring look so sad.
=
It's just because it feels so nostalgic. I think it's so sad. 2ne1 and Big Bang were active together.
=
I don't know why tears always come from Park Bom.
=
This stage is the 5th place because I don't have a dance performer score. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ TT I can't say Mnet What did you do?
=
0:36 As soon as I hear the first bar, it's the same as my reaction
=
Park Bom I'm talking, but the diction is pretty good No lyrics Chewable really ㅠㅠ Anyway, everything is ranked in the order of strongest fandom Eva; Don't worry about the rankings.
=
Park Bom is the brand itself
I sing like my song.
=
I really want to see a group like Big Bang 2NE1 in the future .... Not just a popular group but a compelling group
=
Park Bom sang well This time I really sang well I have to admit ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Spring Sister No matter what rank you are in, you are always happy because you are a light.
=
I'm waiting for you ... if you show me John
I'm still waiting for Blackjack ... I'm waiting for the day when I'll gather again and sing someday ...
=
Chun, do everything you want to do.
=
It's Mike Green ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It goes so well with the tone
=
Sister is nice and wonderful enough I love you ❤️
=
I don't know if it's just me, but I'm sorry for breathing and beat.
=
It's really creepy when you start to sing in spring .... TT
=
I think I saved the stage so well that the lyrics can be seen well.
=
The tone is so good Jade !! ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I can't be sorry. Don't be sorry.
=
Park Bom is so good ♥
=
I love you in spring,
=
I'm going to win first
=
I'm really good at singing
I'm worried about your voice ㅠㅠㅠ
It must be well managed
I'm upset with my fans.
=
The other groups are really good and cool, but when I see Park Bom, I'm so crying. I think 2 Anyone members will come out somewhere.
=
This is so good as long as you feel it in the song ~~~
=
Mnet, please 2ne1 as a surprise
=
It's like a stage where Park Bom's peculiar bending sound shined right away.
=
The last highlight is lip shine ..
=
It's Han Sun-cheon!
=
The tone is crazy
=
I really wanted to see 4 people gathered in the final, but I heard a song, so I'm a solo song.
=
I really miss the 2NE1 in this Queendom. Park Bomman I'm uncomfortable with Solo parts and curves.
=
Song 왤 ke ah ..... The stage composition, direction, dance and singing were all good. I think everyone knows that the rank is low, but that's not important. Nevertheless, I always feel sincere.
=
Park Bom fell out?
=
It's like she's still in Wye.
=
All-round cover of eye nose cover songs
=
It hurts so much, but now I'll call you memories
=
As soon as I heard, I thought it was Bakbom and I thought it was good Bakbom.
=
It hurts so much on stage alone, but now I'll call you memories It's so sad when I call this part
=
Sister, we don't want anything. Don't die alone. Come to the end.
=
Like Mike's voice
=
It's too bad to be comforting ;;
=
The end of tuning is pure
=
Why did you share the two stages?
=
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
=
It's a truly unique voice. I can't do anything but goose bumps.
=
It's important for Korean rice
I covered most of the new kids, but most of the comments were not good enough for the original song, but they did it well ~ (personal thought). Some people point out, but I made it as my own song. There was a problem, but especially the caustic process was too sad, but if I did well than the original songs, I don't think I could do better. I think it's natural that the comments are different. Don't do it ...
=
Really, whoever is my sister Chego ... Really ... I love you. Thank you for singing.
=
I really like Park Bom's emotions, timbres, and talents that allow me to imagine the contents of lyrics in the delivery of lyrics.
But the sad thing is that the basic breathing, a little lack of pronunciation that is not delivered to everyone. I have the talent to give everyone a ring, but it seems that it is not expressed yet. I'm glad that you are endless. I hope it will be more vocalist Park Bom in the future.
=
It's a cancer net that manipulates the rankings, so I hope you enjoy and be happy without worrying about it ㅠㅠㅠ
=
all time number 1 Park Bom. Each stage confirms why Park Bom is a legend or a special tone.
=
If Nelle still has us, I'm sorry.
=
It was really creepy after seeing Han Sun-cheon's facial expressions from 3:55 ...
=
I love you so much ❤❤ Thank you so much for singing
=
The true queen is spring.
=
I really like it
=
Wow, I don't really comment well, but Park Bom is real, I only hear the first measure and goose bumps ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Park Bom's own signature,
=
Really believe and listen ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'm so active these days.
=
The crazy crazy spring girl's eyes nose dancer Han Suncheon ??? My eyes have already turned to water
=
I love it so much!
=
I'm sorry. Don't be sorry.
=
It's a park-singing song. I sing much better than the sun.
=
It was so good to see you in my real legend!
I don't understand why the fifth place is so good.
It's like a fan fight.
Don't be hurt by the rankings because you're the best. Always cheer.
=
2NE1 song I usually hear a lot but I don't know if it's a good song .. The tone is a gang, but it's too hard to sing.
=
The tone is so unique ♡ When I hear Park Bom's voice, I go back to school.
=
Thank you that I can hear this now
=
Park Bom is so cool ...
=
My sister makes me happy because of music
I hope you're always happy
=
I listened with concentration. Ah... !!
=
Do you call your eye nose like this ?????
=
Creepy ㅠㅠ
=
Hull and a male dancer thumb body.
=
I was good at arranging it
=
It's a good stage because I can see the true meaning of a real song on stage. It's great to feel pain in the dark stage dancing next to me, but I feel like expressing the pain of parting, but I can't help being pushed out of the fandom fight.
=
Mnet really hates it in so many different ways
I want you to hear Park Bom's nose.
=
Park Bom is first place
IPRO is more popular than current
=
Isn't Han Suncheon dancing next to you?
=
It's a passing Miracle ...
Park Bom I really enjoyed the stage ...
In the first stage, it was a wonderful stage that the 5th rank from U & I stage so far ...
That's sad...
But it was a group that chewed on the era that was responsible for my used-ding days ...
When I was in my mid 30s, I became more eyed by the young idols.
But this time my nose was really big
Park Bom and Park Bom Cheer up!
=
It's too bad to pronounce.
=
Han Sun-cheon, a modern dancer who came out with a male dancers thumb body dancing next to her!
=
3rd contest rankings
=
United Nations I-MV Crazy,
=
Real Park Bom Queendom I feel so lonely and other groups talk about Dorando, and when I talk to each other, I worry about myself and miss 2NE1 members so much. I want to keep showing your emotions
=
uh? Born brother?
=
Like a teenage singer
=
This is the lower stage ranking
As a result of voting operation for the Produran Idol School
Now the Queendom is a rig ??? I think like this
The children are not weak in fandom
This time it's a lower one ..
=
Creepy. I thought it would be creepy.
=
???? Hansuncheon ????
=
5th place is ok .. Good job.
=
Can't you just play 2NE1 once this time? It's the 10th anniversary of my debut ... I'm doing it at MAMnet, so I'll be enthusiastic if I just attach anything to my name.
=
Park Bom's legend stage came out ~~~~~~
=
It was the first time that I was creepy from the first measure to the end of Queendom ..
=
Park Bom I love you
=
I saw my mouth wide open ... I'm really concentrating on the stage.
=
Why does the microphone sound bad? If you keep listening to the song, it sounds like you're eating it.
=
3:57 I was listening with a creepy song but I was serious because I had a serious look.
=
3:57 I was surprised to know that it was Gwang-hee.
=
Oh ㅠㅠㅠㅜ ㅡ Tear me too ㅠㅠ Singing is so creepy spring Sister Please keep singing.
=
Pendulum is so good
=
Real vote ... it's too meaningless ... Did you just tear me away?
=
I only hear Park Bom in Queen's Kingdom !!
=
And Park Bom who danced with Park Bom, who came out on the thumb body ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Really good
=
I think you're not so good in spring ..
=
Wow, immersion is not a joke .. I can't concentrate. ㅠㅠㅠ Concentration ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I like Park Bom's voice, but I'm honestly listening
=
The stage is full ...
=
I'm worried so I'll be doing big bang.
=
4:08 Aren't you the agar on this guy's thumb body?
=
Wow. My heart gets eaten.
=
I sing well.
=
I'm really alone on the stage
=
What's the use of ranking?
I just like Park Bom.
=
Unfortunately I haven't
=
Is it only me? On TV, the caustic part sounds like a lip-sync, but when you see it on your mobile, it sounds good again.
=
sister
I'm leaving
Sister
=
Even if nothing is added to the song, the feeling of being full seems to be the power that only Park Bom can do ....
=
I used to think that 4 people gathered and shined like that, but when each person gathered and shined, I made a bigger light. I hope you don't forget there's jacks
=
Park Bom I love you
=
No matter what anyone says in my mind, she's the top of every group.
=
That voice ....
=
Honestly, all the other singers played with performances, and Park Bom played only with songs, so it's no wonder that the rankings are lower than other teams. Park Bom
=
BIGBANG 2NE1 seems to have overruns in the entertainment industry.
=
I love you Park Bom is the coolest
=
Wow and creepy ... When I sing the Park Bokke, it feels vague and sad.
=
As soon as I hear the storm tears ... If you've ever loved your nose, it's like a song
=
But did Park Bom sing like that? I thought the microphone was disconnected at the first episode, but every time I look at it, I feel like I'm constantly disconnected and it doesn't sound good. ㅠㅠ Why do I sing well?
=
Spring Sister is always the number one in my heart Sister is the best My sister don't die I love you sister !! ♥-♥
=
Wow, Park Bom's eyes, noses and mouths
=
Personally, I thought this was first place for children and Park Bom or Mamamu for second place ... who knew this stage would be fifth.
=
No real people
=
Spring Spring ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Really never again
=
From 3:55 I'm going to have a blast because of my face ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Listening at the cafe, I almost noticed it.
=
Park Bom is Park Bom ...
=
Why did I wash when the back dancer gave me my hair?
=
Why do you cry when you hear a voice ??? ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Good job, I love you
=
ㅠㅠㅠ I'm using my nose in the park .... ❤️❤️❤️
=
My eyes are so sad
=
Park Bom, you look hard
=
It's so squeezing It's like a middle split It's hard to sing ...
=
Look like dancer cocoon
=
Han Seoncheon ... Awesome ... A man who danced or not?
=
Park Bom! I'm doing really well!
Pretty! I will always support you!
=
What ... I didn't even know that as soon as I started singing, I stopped in a hurry. On the train ... It's just a lot of stuff.
=
Hanseoncheon was handsome in the meantime
=
It's creepy
=
It was over when I sang the first bar ...
=
Is that man a dance romance?
=
I felt so fast watching yesterday, so I'm looking at 0.75 speed.
=
Now when Charin comes to the final, the game is over.
=
I'm not a male thumb body.
=
This is first place
=
I can't wait for Han Seoncheon to come out
=
Tone is really real ...
=
No, it's because it's the same company. Park Bom sings like that song.
=
I'm only crying when I see this
=
It's a green microphone.
=
Our spring sister ㅠㅠ I feel like crying every time on stage.
=
It's been good since long ago.
=
Goose bumps from the first bar
=
Volume is not good enough
=
I'll tear you down.
=
The tone is unique
=
Park Bom doesn't suck at all
=
Hansuncheon ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Tears.
=
Wow, first class
=
Park Bom is full of volume.
=
I wasn't expecting the stages, but this stage is a top one
=
Crazy creepy
=
Hancook's hand
=
I'm upset because I'm so full of breath that I'm feeling worse than I used to.
=
What should I do with this voice? This voice can't imitate anyone
=

=
It's a stage where you need to control your emotions.
Park spring tone is a real unique ....!
=
Why is Han Seon Chun here ?!
=
I don't understand why the ranking is low every time
=
It's a combination of eyes and noses
=
Park Bom is so great as the Queendom round passes. I don't intend to disparage other teams, but to be honest, if the results aren't good, I'm starting to change directions (and that's how many times in a row). It's so nice and respectful to push my strengths. Above all, thanks to Park Bom, I'm not dwelling on the Queen's ranking. I want to see Park Bom who keeps on moving so long!
=
It's like a song that reminds me of the past ...
=
The voice is really dancing.
=
It's hard to fill the stage with a single voice. That's why Spring is doing it.
=
It's hard to find Korean
=
Even come here and sing. Thank you .... Someone in the Korean comments mentioned that she says “you / you” three times-I miss you you you-alluding to the three girls she misses.
=
Park Bom performance is not enough but honestly I like this story performance is better .. Do you need to dance gorgeously? Isn't that stereotype?
=
It's sad that kids who don't know 2ne1 just think it's just a love song ...
=
I usually think of you, a lover who missed you. Spring ,,,,,,
=
Why the lyrics of “I'll be here” sound so sad. Wasn't Park Bom coming to Queendom to win this message to the members?
=
This show definitely has a lot of messages ...
I feel like I'm making a promise that 4 people will come back again.
=
The golden, purple and orange mic stands without spotlights can't be so sad ....
You've always been together, you, you're crazy.
=
Park Bom's sister's voice is really unchanged and the same, more tears, the feelings of sad feelings such as longing, nostalgia, and eagerness. When I watched my juniors in Queendom, I felt more and more reminiscent of 2ne1 activities, so the final song was more painful. It's like calling the members by shouting that I want to go back to that time
=
I really feel that Park Bom misses 2NE1 members sincerely because of the stage composition.
=
I'm really crying once in this part. I really want spring to spring.
=
This is really amazing Park Bom's not dead.
=
How do you sing a song even though the in-ear is missing? It's so great.
=
I love spring sisters. Oh, I keep seeing this. Tears keep coming out like crazy. I think about old days. I don't know why spring sister is below.
=
3:35 "You" refers to three times and creepy
=
2 Anyone fans will know
Park Bom Mike's green color is 2NE1 members and backdancer costume crush.
I listened to 2NE1 song when I was in middle school.
I'm already in my mid twenties.
I will keep the memories of 2NE1 that was passionate at that time
If you are a foreign person, please like it.
I'll support you in the spring and spring activities!
=
Why is Parkbok just good for me?
=
Park Bom is the best time to sing.
=
Why are you crying like this? TT Spring is all you want to do ... It's really salty.
=
It's the Park Bom video, why is it so annoying to me?
=
I want to see you as a 2ne1 fan until the end of the attachment.
=
Park Bom is a solo player, so she's been lost in fandom fights.
It's so good because I can see myself working hard every time
=
The song is really good. Parkbom seems to be the best if I sing only performances

The Last Spring Sister Dance-Choreographed on 2NE1 "In the Club"
Conclusion-baboon
=
It's not just a love song
=
When you dance alone at about 3:41 seconds, it's like a dance at the introduction of 2ne1 In The Club ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
You're so sad because you are = Minji, you = Dara, you are CL 3 microphones red = Dara purple = Minji gold = CL green = Park Bom ㅠㅠ
=
I don't know if the camera is really good as I talked with Park Bom, but I don't know if Park Bom on the other side of the mirror doesn't really make sense. I feel separated and I feel more immersed in Park Bom.
=
Spring, it's so cool, tears are falling
=
It was the biggest and best stage that a solo could do
=
Mike was the problem at Y & I. Why is in-ear now?
=
All memories .. Reminiscing about the past ... Red hair ... Empty 3 digits ... Purple (Minji) microphone .. Gold (CL) microphone .. Red (Dara) microphone. I can't but look at each other from a distance and cheer and grow up.
=
2:08 I think I've been missing from this time.
=
The meaning of this song is so nice, my heart melts, and I know Park Bom misses her members, I love you Pak Bom❤️
=
Spring sister, the group was disbanded, and it's hard to show the fans with the firepower and the perforates, and the stage fills up the ranks, pushes the ranks up, and so many difficult, exhausting, and disadvantageous parts. I hope you don't get so upset or hurt even if this final ranking is not the top one. I think that the real queen is a real sister who fights against each other without being pushed alone. Please remember that the spring sisters of 2WEN1's day and the current spring sisters were always queens.
=
While listening to the music, I thought that the lyrics were written by missing 2ne1 no matter who listened to it, and I felt so longing and loneliness that I felt as I was soloing in the group. I feel like I've missed 2NE1 by watching the groups in Queendom, and I think they were 2ne1's youth, no matter how many fans they miss but not Lastly, when I was on stage together, I dyed with the red hair and used the green microphone that I loved so much that I really hope everyone was happy. I was crying again when I saw the club beating badly. If the legs are people who cry can only leave the stage ㅠㅠ ranking was not really alone reminiscing happy now thankful for letting my sister stood on a program called Challenge kwindeom among the groups real ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm crazy. Is this not a real performance?
=
Park Bom: How hard it was to be alone? Alone among the groups ... I've been so hard and I want to meet so much next time, I'm crying that four people are standing on the stage holding the microphone. 3:40 2NE1 in the club Choreographer Kilpo TT
=
Wow ... My sister is just my lifelong goddess. I wish I could go back, but in the end my sister is my goddess.
=
It seems like Park Bom wants to go back to 2NE1 when he was active.
=
Spring is always cheering! Overcome your sadness and show me a lot of new looks!
=
At last I saw what choreography comments.
=
Spring is you = you are CL You = Dara, you can be Minji or blackjack ㅠㅠ
=
It was creepy that the members of the stand microphone had the microphone plugged in but no members and the only person who could make a sound was Park Bom Alone.
=
Really think 2ne1 is immense ...
=
I'm just literaly wanna cry when hear this song
=
In our time, 2NE1 was a legend, and they still missed and were great. Park Bom was the vocal of the center, and even after a long time, we want to go back together.
=
Rather than being eager to win and win this program, I really miss the past and want to see the members, so I'm close to my heart.
I really want to give it To here, I'm so hard here I love you Park Bom Sister There will be a day when I will be back someday There are so many people who still remember ...... Fighting Let's erase all the scars in my heart Awesome
=
It seems to see something degenerate queen. It is a new age and the glory of one time is now passed down to the successor, but still an honorable and brilliant queen.
=
You know, you guys are working with Minjung Music Works, and both of them are soon out of contract, so there's a good chance that the three will solve the problem and get together with Park Bom's division. Above all, members are keen to reunite 2NE1. It's a matter of letting me use my name, but like Beast's highlights, it's open to the possibility of renaming by renaming.
※ There is no part that has been properly discussed or decided on reunion so far. I am a person who wants 2NE1 reunion more eagerly than anyone.
※ The contract with CL YG was terminated on November 8, 2019.
=
As soon as I run this program, Park Bom misses 2NE1 so much that it's too dark.
=
The first stage with four mirrors and mics was perfect and creepy. Now I'm on the stage of Queendom Final stage, but it seems to be thick with creepy things.
=
He has a legend today
2019 10/31 10:34
=
I'm listening to CL's new song, but both of you miss 2ne1. I hope you can see me on stage again.
=
It's a real tone.
=
If you can't go back to spring, you can make it again. I can't remember crying after watching the video that Minji sent before singing this song. I'm not only missing us.
=
At this time, Park Bom wears a sweat set while practicing.
=
Bom is doing really well.
There was a lot of tears from our 2NE1 microphone.
It was a perfect stage
I will always support you
Just hold on like you do now ... I love you ...
=
Park Bom's diorama of life seems to have been staged ... The indiscriminate touching arm is not a memory arm but a restrained yet clear stage and appealing vocals, the heart of the Perfora devoted to colleagues and one's past becomes hot. To enter the mall that makes you forget that it's a stage.
=
The song is really ... the tone.
=
Wow, this stage is a stage that we would all be impressed with if we were in 2A1 and school days. ㅠㅠ It was so creepy to share with someone who had the same appearance as Park Bom's past at first. Thank you ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom is so cool and cheering.
=
Park Bom, it's only you, I still love you
=
Am I really honest with Park Bom? I had this idea. The tone is good but I am good at singing. But after seeing the Queen's stage, I gradually feel like a great man. You can't do anything that can soothe and heal people with songs. But the power, the song tone, the emotions, and the finals call me in a better neck, so great, so nice and so thankful.
The stage where I cried while watching the Queendom was the stage. Usually ballads are sad and end, but the spring sister is sad and I think I have to endure more. It's okay, you can do it It's okay to be sick, it's okay to be hard, you can overcome it and do everything. Thank you so much like I hear these words
=
Park Bom Korea Madonna is so cool, the stage is more glamorous than many girl groups do. The tears are so glamorous.
=
Good song?
=
Just listen to the spring sister's song
=
I'm always surprised whenever I listen to Park Bom's voice. My sister's voice always comes through my heart. We always support ♡
=
I cried, I cried when I saw you really Mike, I watched you in a 2NE1 dress up and cryed, and you don't have to be the queen, it's okay if you don't have 1st place, please, I'm happy ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
1:38 Mike shows up and surprised
Members Mike I'm right!
I really like the last contest, but this feels better, and when I first heard it, the four of them were drawn in my head ... Lyrics, delivery power, and Park Bom.
=
But it's not our fans who miss that beauty the most.
They were more beautiful than anyone at that time.
=
2014 mama came over to see you sad
=
The back dancers are holding microphones and looking at their hairstyles ... I think they miss the members while they miss something.
=
Oh, I can't breathe because I'm so sad. Please come and have a day when all four members can stand on the same stage.
=
The standing microphone is 2NE1 members' individual color, and the dancers dance the costumes, hair, and choreography of the members at the time. How much tears will the fans recognize? In the club, choreography at the end of the spring is In the club and you, you, I miss three people in the part you miss ... ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Those microphones 2NE1 members Mike .. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT Real tears come to the ground ............ I feel that Park Bom wants to go back to those days.
=
This is Queen Park is Queen
I like other groups more, but now the stage is queen ...
=
Cial gold
Minji Violet
Dara Red
I miss them with a microphone
=
Even after a long time, we remember each other that there was each other and that there was still
=
It's so cute dancing at the end of spring
=
The last dance in the club choreography, I'm old in spring and I didn't have a good shape in the days of Leeds.
=
Look at the different colors of each microphone member.
=
No, the stage is so good that I keep coming in
=
Real tears my tears button .. every time I see ..
=
I thought this while dancing spring spring sister. I can't dance with my spring sister, but I remember the dance that contains our memories.
=
Your voice is so awesome
=
Really ... the spring voice was the one who knew 2NE1 at that time and who had sung their songs once.
=
I thought it was a queen.
=
Have you seen other 2NE1 members in this video? ㅠㅠ Real tears 2NE1 complete stage stage.
=
I love you so much ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom is a lot of controversy and I don't understand much about it, but I really need to admit my love for my group, 2ne1.
=
Four mics are really ... really wooly.
=
3:26 Screaming .... choreography behind ..
=
I thought now, why did you do that? I thought that was the color of my hair on the stage of 2NE1
=
Please send me back TT TT TT
=
2ne1 I want to combine it again
=
1:58 When four people came out to dance
=
4 microphone sticks.
I'm sad because it fits so well with song and park.
I want to go back.
I miss you so much.
=
Spring!
It was June 2011 when I first met you as a music video.
I was 50 years old and had been in the military for 29 years.
It's about the time I first started to be interested in K-POP.
2NE1 (Park Bom, Sandara, CL, Minji)! My heart hurts when I think of you guys.
I was so passionate and wanted to continue the music ...
If I had been active so far, I could have been a girl group BTS.
What a pity!
How disappointed would the dream have been like a bubble?
Spring!
Even though you have some faults, don't blame yourself.
I believe that one day everyone will come together to perform.
Even though now I live my own life, stay in touch.
And do your best in your place!
Let's look forward to the future all together!
Bom!
I met you in the music video for the first time in June 2011.
It was when I was 50 years old and had been in the army for 29 years.
It's around the time I first got interested in K-pop.
2NE1 (Park Bom, Sandara, CL, Gong Min-ji)!
It hurts to think of you guys.
You guys were so passionate, so eager to continue your music ...
If you've been active, you could have been a BTS member of a girl group. What a pity!
How disappointed would you be that the dream had vanished like a bubble?
Bom!
Even though you have some mistakes, let's not blame ourselves.
I believe there will come a day when everyone will get together and perform.
Although we are living each other's lives now, keep in touch.
And do your best in your seat!
Let's look forward to a future where we will all be together someday!
=
Spring is so cool

Stage interpretation
1. Park Bom Redhead = Two
Anyone's last stage at mama
2. Back dancers costume = members of mama's last stage mama costume
3. Color standing microphone by member
4. Final dance + glittering tent under
2NE1's first mini album in the club cover and choreography
+) Park Bom's custom is green because yg doesn't give it when he comes out of the green mic company he used when he was yg
=
2NE1 would still be in Queen's Kingdom with you so much. TT TT Produced the ability to produce a lot of awesome things like the other groups as well. How much did you think of 2NE1 as you watched other groups laughing and crying together?
=
I'm crying ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
Sister ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
Really nice and nice
It's better to go through the stage you're alone on ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
Wool sister top
You are BlackJek an eternal star.
=
This is first place if you only sing.
=
Mike's color is the member's member, and I missed the old Park Bom voice. Thanks for filling the stage by myself
=
Most of the songs are hard to beat and finish at the beginning, but this song is due to Park Bom's tone or the indirect memory of 2NE1. I hope to go back but I know I can't do it myself .... So I have no choice but to sing like this ... I can really feel howl ...
=
Gold Mike CL, purple Mike Minji, red Mike Sandara Park.
=
I love you in spring, I'm happy ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
But I really didn't know who Park Bom was.
=
The best stage
=
It's not because I don't hate Park Bom, but the last performance is a bit funny.
=
Why are you crying?
=
In the club!
In the club!
=
I miss you so much. Nostalgic song ... I miss the moment when I listened to 2NE1's song.
=
Every time I listen to Park Bom's song, I was so sad and impressed .... I didn't know the old 2NE1, but I just missed the members when I watched this show. It's a great sound
=
2ne1 I miss you so much.
=
Although the ranking wasn't high, when I used a choir for Y & I, I covered a cheetah and a joint stage.
In the stage of the eye nose, everything from modern dance collaboration to this comeback sound source
It was the best stage. I want to see a lot of good stages in the future.
=
Park Bom's voice is truly unique. Sing well and have fun. I sing for a long time. When I'm 60, my sister's concert is really fun.
=
Spring, thank you
=
December 10, 2019 6 PM Wait for "First Snow" and look forward to being listed on the Billboard World Digital Chart by <33. If you look at the five songs listed this year and the rest of the song, the first snow is not the style that Global Fandom wants, but the speciality of Park Bom and Sandara Park's duet collaboration may be exceeding expectations.

You can't dance in spring. I waited. How about even if it's not first? My sister is the biggest memory of my life
=
Tears or TT TT TT TTT TTT TTT TTT T
=
The song is so good
=
Don't worry about your rank ... they're the active idols ... your sister legend legend ...
=
I hope the spring music music continues
I'll cheer you up.
=
Queen Park Spring! ㅠㅠ ㅠ ㅠ tears down
=
Oh, I'm going to tears ㅠㅠ 2ne1 ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Real Park Bom is Park Bom.
=
ㅠㅠ Sad ㅠㅠ
=
Scarecrow, snow nose, rewind, it is impossible to ask me to make a record together ㅠ I do not know whether this is technically possible, but emotional request.
=
Honestly, I'm not a Park Bom fan, but this song is so sad.
Park Bom seems to be weak because he's warm ... I don't know mentally healthy people, but I can't live without a neuro stabilizer once a week because I have a headache.
So when the problem broke out for the first time, people were so insulted that they were so insulted. Someone who hasn't really felt sick doesn't know .. The progress of science related to psychiatry is so insignificant, and the cause of the terrible headache that devours my daily life is that no one has yet found it. I understood. These days, Korea's interest in depression, medicine, and psychiatry is very much felt.
I hope it goes well anyway. I felt like I was missing 2NE1 so I didn't feel good about watching Queendom.
=
I wasn't telling you the title ... I was crying after seeing 4 standing microphones
=
I'm so eager, empathetic and sad. This is not really you. It's not really you 2ne1 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The song is really good. The last dance was just fun for me.
=
The song is really good.
The song is really good too good
Just good, like listening to this song for a while
=
The song is creepy and dance too cute ❤️ I really like this sister ❤️
=
Park Bom ... I'm really good at singing.
=
My sister is the best, no matter who I'm in. I love her voice and love her voice more than anyone.
=
Well done Park Bom sister !!!!! <3
=
Park Bom I want you to sing for a long time. The voice is really unique.
=
I want to see 2ne1 again
Revert back ~~~
=
Sister is the best ♥♥ Park Bom!
=
Park Boom is always passionate and serious!
=
It's like a song that remembers when the mermaid first liked the prince when it became a bubble ...
=
It's really unique
=
3 back dancers
=
I really don't have to talk about Park Bom's vocal skills .. Really Bom Bom was solo in the groups, but I'm so alone and thankful
=
I will make a real concert
=
Four mics, you four times too.
=
Adele-like.
=
I miss you so much ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Thank you very much for overcoming the burden of being alone and showing me good stages. It's a night when 2NE1 is missing. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I miss you on stage together.
=
I'm sad
=
I am glad to see such a wonderful stage. I love you.
=
In the club, I danced so badly at last, so I'm crying more ..... Why do you dance alone?
=
All of you guys have a new song 'First Snow' at 10 pm on December 10 !!! It's my first duet song with Dara. Please listen a lot.
=
Wow, four mic standings.
=
Minji gave me a video letter and the expectation of the whole body was high. ㅠㅠ Low ranking, but still showed the fans loved by watching the fans through the Queendom to show what they can do and communicate to want to listen to the fans through the instagram live Ms. I just wanted to have fun and wanted to do what I wanted to do. Thank you very much for coming out to Queendom and I want to listen to the song again but I feel like I have a lot of trouble so I want you to relax and play a good song.
=
2ne1 is the best comeback ever.
=
Tone quality crazy
=
Park Bom's last dance ... stays for too long. Impressive ~ The view of the life of a singer named Park Bom is not a perfection of dance
=
It's not the same color as Mike 2ne1
=
Standing microphone really
I matched the clothes and the color.
=
There are three microphones on the stage. The color of the microphone that CL Minji uses on stage ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I keep watching other stages and come back to this video. ,, The deepest stage of the real afterglow is spring sister stage.
=
Beautiful Park Bom fighting! ❤️
=
Please let me know how you did it
=
There was a time when 2NE1 was a tower, but I remembered and cried all the time.
=
Tears! I love you ~
=
Thank you so much for coming out of Queendom
=
You can live now even if you don't go back. Nothing will ever be the same, but I think if we make it now, we will have a chance to meet and laugh together someday. Park Bom I thought it was so cool and still not dead. This last stage was charismatic and springy. Please be active in the future as more original, cool and confident Park Bom
=
That's why the colors of the microphones are the color of the members ...
=
Four mic colors are different ...
=
This stage is really ... Lyrics and microphone colors as well. "You, you," three of the lyrics, I'm talking about ... Ha ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Tears literally shed real
=
I keep falling in.
=
The rest of Mike's members are plugged in.
=
No real tears
2NE1 I want to see complete
=
The song is good and the live is so good.
=
What's the dyed color ??? Awesome ..
=
If you get out of spring, why are you so crazy?
=
As a fan I loved so much, I get eaten every time I watch this song.
=
Everyone, I'm Park Bok as a performance vocal solo! Candidates are Ben (180 degrees), Chen (we will be separated after April), Jang Beom-jun (in a karaoke room), Park Bom (spring)
), Taeyeon (Four Seasons), Kim Jaehwan (Hello) Please pick Park Bom to be a candidate! Thank you so much for watching
=
How can I not see you in spring?
=
Pokémon I loved the aura filled with Sichuan king .....
=
I hope I'll get together again 2ne1 Dismantling stories Even though I've never heard of the discord between members, I'm never too good and can't be disagreeable.
=
At this time, Park Bom was missing .. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ But it sounds so high.
=
I've always been with you You're talking to me three times I think it's Minji Dara Charini ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Come back ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The song has a charming voice. Please sing a lot of good songs.
=
That Beem ~~~!
=
I'm a big fan but I honestly remember Park Bom's stage, I felt so embarrassed to see the song, the tone and the stage's feelings.
=
Listen and cry ... Oh let me stand on stage again
=
Most of the people who see the Queendom are heavyweights, and I don't know 2ne1 in detail and I just miss Park Bom's stage as a stage ... I missed the members at once, and the stage also symbolized 2ne1's other members. .... I can see that it is a very elaborate stage.
=
It was the perfect stage except for the last dance.
=
Let's go to Queendom Season 2.
=
At the end of the stage, I danced so hard that I missed four people and now I feel alone, but I feel like I'm trying to do well .... ㅠㅠ
=
My sister is so wonderful, I'm so beautiful, I love you.❤️‍‍❤️‍‍❤️‍‍‍❤️‍‍‍❤️‍‍‍❤️‍‍
=
Foreign fans are waiting for 2ne1 to come back ... please come back ~~~
=
The only singer in my husband 2NE1 !! Still morning alarm is 2NE1's song.
=
I watched the previous Park Bom video while watching this.
=
Mike ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ 2NE1 members used the microphone ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ tear button ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I keep thinking about songs
=
I would have always used to be number one and always be in a group. However, even though I wanted to stand alone and compete with my juniors, I was really impressed with how I always did my best on the stage every time. I hope you will sing like this in the future. ❤❤❤
=
I lost my way
Like a lost child
can you find my way?
Shine the light, my
Tomorrow is not dark
Don't fall
I do n’t wanna be alone
please do n’t let me go
(I miss you.
Our last day)
By the word "hello"
That night I cried out
Irreversible, irreversible,
I have no place to go back to you
I wanna go back I wanna go back
You've always been together, I miss you so much
I wanna go back
It has become cold
It's like my heart outside the window
I hold onto you as I fade alone here
Just once, even for one day
I want to go back
(I miss you.
Our last day)
By the word "hello"
That night I cried out
Irreversible
I have no place to go back to you
I wanna go back I wanna go back
You've always been together, I miss you so much
I wanna go back
I'll be here when you come back
Waiting for that day
Irreversible
I have no place to go back to you
I wanna go back I wanna go back
You've always been together, I miss you so much
I wanna go back
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh
=
You miss you ... I'm sad because I'm like 2NE1 members.
=
I wish you well.
=
Give it back, I'm really desperate
=
Oh, it's so sad that 3 microphones were put on it ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
You suffered for a long time.
=
Park Bom likes it
=
2NE1 is also famous, so I know a few of the representative songs, and I was not interested in Park Bom's narrative.
=
When I first heard this song, I was referring to Park Bom's 2NE1 members. When 2NE1 came out, I didn't know because I was young.
=
Ah, three empty microphones. I mean all the members. Are you sad?
=
It looks like 2NE1 custom mic index on 4 mic stands.
=
From the mirror performance to 2NE1 members 'microphones and vacant seats, dancers' costumes and reversal lyrics, I'm very impressed because I know what it means. Reversal is the song that contains the true heart of spring. When I think about how hard it was to tears and tears ㅠㅠ again, tears are falling again ... I think it was the most touching stage among the real stages.
=
If you listen to your eyes are like English ..
=
4 microphones
=
Not a musician in Korea ~~ ♡
=
Park Bom Song
CL
=
Awesome vocals
=
The song was wonderful. I missed the end of the song but it wasn't plugged in so I just sang it !!
=
Guys .. 3:40 This part 2NE1 In the club I don't wanna ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Real tear glands exploding ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ My heart # 1 is Park Bom.
=
I miss you.
=
impressive.
=
When the last final spring was a song, I remembered the girl groups I liked when I was young .... I felt like I missed those days .... I heard tears .... My favorite girl group was Rainbow. What would it be like if I came to Queendom?
=
The Little Mermaid Ursula Line ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Cheer up ... I feel like I'm in a song
=
The real spring tones are legends
=
Songs are frowning ㅠㅠ Park Bom in the early days pretty face was changed, I was sad and burdened ‥ As much as the sound is awesome !!! I want to see again with 2ne1
=
The song is crazy .. Park Bom's tone and song lyrics and concept.
=
The microphone on stage is so sad
=
You, you, you three times, I cried because I felt like calling the members
=
Childhood .. Anyone who liked Tuenny One sees a stage where one's heart is frowned .. The spring sister who makes a high-pitched sound even though I fell in before the treble. I miss the old days while listening .. I want to see .. 2NE1 .. sing to karaoke.
=
Park Bom, you're the first place. ❤️
=
Spring❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
Like a little mermaid
=
I cry ...
=
Wow .. The mirror was creepy at first, but it was really creepy to stand in four people.
=
Good spring!
=
Park Bom I love you
=
Crazy ... 4 microphones are 2NE1 members. Dancer costumes are the final performance costumes.
=
I'm listening to the lyrics
I can see how much Park misses yg and 2ne1 at the time.
I didn't eat half and half, but I'm sorry for something.
Idol, who was on the big stage with the first place in popular songs
That way I miss the past.
=
Just tears come out
=
I miss you.
=
Everyone knows that there is a choreographed 2NE1 stage choreography and back dancers + Park Bom, total of 4 standing dancers 2NE1 other members of the hairstyle or dress .... Really screaming ... .....
=
I've been spinning for the first time
=
I don't know all the narrations of 2NE1, but it was the most memorable stage of the Queendom group's stage so far, and Park Bom's sadness was so good that it was the best queen and the king. Thank you Park Bom for telling the world a wonderful voice, for not giving up. I love you so much ... I love you ❤❤
=
Why are you so sad?
=
The silverfish squeaks and beats me.
If you're not a fan ...
Mike's costume last dance.
=
Is Park Bom's reason to participate in the Queendom and the song he wanted to sing? True Final Song
=
Anyone who wears the same dance as Park Bom at first?
=
Is anyone listening to this song right now?
A ... no way;
=
Song for members and blackjack ....
=
Let 's reunite 2NE1. ..
=
You don't need anything, just listen to the song ~ I hope you know you're good enough and deserved to be loved ~~ Park Bom Since he's cool, focus on the song now
=
Even though I'm alone
Thank you for always doing a good show.
Park Bom sister is the best !!!!! ❤️
=
Pak Bom's heart goes down to here.
=
2ne1 love each other and love each other and want to stand again, but can't you really stay together?
=
I'm still good at singing. I can't hate you.
=
Appreciation
=
Stage production is awesome, but only fans can recognize it.
=
This is better than Han.
=
I love spring
=
I'm crying.
=
The part that surprised me most was that I didn't even know that Park Bom would make a high pitched sound.
=
The last choreography in the club ..... Tears ...
=
Park Bom's voice is not my style, so I don't like it, but I think this final stage was better than anyone else.
=
What effect is this? I heard last time, but I can't remember ㅠㅠ Can you tell me?
=
Good song!
=
Spring-I want to go back
CL- Let's go back
=
If you break up, you seem to know more precious. If you reach the heart, the day of gathering together and the day of entertainment will come.
=
While working, my throat gets blocked and tears come. 2n
As a fan of e1, it's a memory that makes me remember the time I spent my childhood from debut to breakup. In the meantime, Park Bom was so upset that he sang so well and his voice was still good ... I hope everyone will have a happy life. Let's be forever 2ne1
=
The group 2ne1 is not just an idol. Someone's just a teenager, a teenager in their 20s ... When they came out with four microphones to watch this performance, and the lyrics themselves hurt so much they cried. Please come back to us.
=
I hope you don't mind that the ranking is low. Park Bom's middle school student is the best singer and all the solo songs and stages make me sing. Park Bom's own voice and the way to decorate the stage can't be followed. Like all of the idols who follow Park Bom's stage, they are impressed and surprised by Park Bom's stage. A lot of people who know Park Bom's stage are impressed and amazed by Park Bom's stage. I'm looking forward to more wonderful activities. In my eyes, Park Bom's stage is the prettiest and coolest.
=
Tears from the title
=
Large singer
Force Explosion Park Bom ~
=
I knew it by looking at the microphone color.
=
I can't go back in time, my memories are past. I miss my childhood when I remember it and never come back.
=
I was more impressed than the competition. Lyrics, songs, and Park Bom's voice
=
The costumes of the dancers were the costumes of the members when I was the best.
=
Infinite Repeat Now
=
Every time I listen to this song
I'm not a 2NE1 fan but I spent my school days listening to 2NE1 songs ..
Whenever I can't go back, I miss my school days and can't go back.
=
I miss you 2NE1
=
When the 3 mic come im cry ㅠㅠ
=
Spring is the last time I'm so cute ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Do whatever spring wants you to do. Do everything you want to do
=
Why do tears come? I really feel it.
=
How can you sing like that while still missing? Park Bom is so genius
=
2ne1 Please join me once ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I miss you !!!!!!!!
=
The other stages were really cool, and the admiration came out, but this stage of Park Bom was a stage where tears came out. Good job.
=
Park Bom ... the best !!
=
I'm crying while listening to the songs.
=
If you aren't a fan of spring, please search the club and listen to it.
=
I can't believe Mnet's voting anymore.
=
My sister's number one sister!
=
Ha ... Tear me out.
=
I'm crying.
=
The spring is empty with four stand microphones .. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Oh, this stage is so concentrated and cool .....
=
Park Bom, are you fat?
=
Queendom Discrimination Park Bom Video Why is it so much lower than other idol videos? There were a lot of views
=
Ah really crazy voice
=
1:20 It hurts me to do it three times when you were with me.
=
Minji video letter, spring crying sadly to the members, the lyrics of the song to the members, the colored microphone of each member appeared on the stage, screaming and crying over and over again many times, and I still loved and cheered for the first time. I love you
=
I'm alone in the Queendom, so lonely and hard, but I've been able to hold on well and look cool until the end ... I'll leave it in my heart forever. Park, walk in front of flowers only! ❤
=
Just the best, I need more
=
This is the best stage I wish Park Bom was the first time
=
^^ The spring hair always goes down with hair style. Forehead is awesome. It's like a complex, but it's pretty and charming, but when you bang your hair someday, it's cute.
=
I think the lyrics are talking about 2NE1.
=
I really want to do my sister
It is a stage that cannot be done without Park Bom. Wow, it's really wow
=
Park Bom's song is really good. I applaud the support.
=
Believe
=
I don't like Park Bom and my body has been damaged by plastic addiction and time. This stage is cool enough to show the stage more than in the past Tuennyy.
=
Real emotion .. Emotions like tears .. This song is awesome.
=
Weak tears.
=
Park Bom-stage is so sad. I feel like I'm falling apart from people who have been like a group for the rest of my life. This song seems to have been made because I had more memories of my activities. Park Bom is the best way to go.
=
I don't know why dancing at the end is so sad but ...
=
Please keep working as a real solo ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Spring sister
You've worked hard to play Queendom. There were a lot of disadvantages when you played against other groups.
Final was good and the other stage was me to another spring sister fans, please be happy please spring sister
=
Good voice
=
Park Bom's final song is that Park Bom has planned and created this song since she accepted it.
The previous songs prepare to sing this song.
Queendom performance ranking
The first place finalist is
I think Park Bom
I was looking forward to seeing 4 really mics and coming with me 2ne1
=
I love you Park Bom
=
Dance line is like spring
=
Spring ㅠㅠ Park Bom ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Thank you for the song again ㅠㅠㅠㅜ Thank you for coming out of Queendom
=
Park Bom, I really love you.
=
ㅠ ㅜㅜㅜㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Spring sister ㅠㅜ
=
Hull Mike 2ne1 members
=
My heart is ringing ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I remember my luck while listening to it
=
Many miss them yet.
=
Thank you for singing good songs
=
Park Bom's music is really good
Haha He's powering Park Bom
It's nice to be similar ^^
Please make a lot of good music❤
=
It's not a dancer's costume.
=
Last Ending Shot I've been watching something and it's like the Disney Little Mermaid, but it sounds like it's just like 2ne1.
=
Lyrics
=
2NE1 feels that members miss the group too much compared to other disbanded idols. There was no member disagreement or a member who wanted to turn into an actor. If YG had a little more care, it would have been a group activity. Sad group ...
It's going to be hard right now, but I'll be waiting for you to come back to perfection someday.
=
Last dance in the club ...
=
Too sad in no place to go back
=
I want to see you make spring lighter
=
I cheer for you!
=
It's because of the solo performance. I think this song is so good.
=
I watched the Minji video and I know weeping one person.
I miss you. I miss you. I miss you.
I miss you .. I miss you .. oh ..
When you miss you so much
I miss CL, MINZY, DARA so much.
I was so eccentric because it was the same.
Nolza's clothes are like clothes, and my head is clapping.
=
My criteria was most memorable .. Yesterday I saw tears.
I also try to organize rice cakes
-Red hair = 2nd cause of the last 2015mama stage headed by Park Bom (which seems to have changed quickly a few days ago)
4 microphones
Dara Ciel Minzy by color
Backdancer Costume
This is also 2015mama members costume
-That shiny plastic that goes up at the end
Adon Care Album Cover
-Park Park dances hard .. ^ ♡ ^
Choreographed in the club introduction
+++ 2019 11 08 current
CL hasn't resigned with YG.
=
I love you
=
Park Bom is the best. I've been alone in Queendom.
=
Park Bom is number one for me. I have a hard time! I miss when we were 2NE1 .. I miss you. It's the stage of four stages.
=
Awesome sea .....
=
The fabric, which is laid on the stage floor and lifted to the second stage, is the same color as the album cover of the album in the club, and the dance that Park Bom is at the end of the stage is In the club choreography ㅠㅠㅠ
=
And the song is really awesome ... creepy ......
=
Park Bom's sister's voice is designated as national treasure. It's really nice to be able to hear this voice live until this time. 2NE1 I miss you so much ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Park Bom, are you still pretty and amazing? So please keep working .., I'm so happy these days. I heard my sister's voice again !!!!!!!!!!! ❤️
=
Wow, the stage is cool. I thought and read the comments, but when I saw the stage again .. ㅠ ㅠ Park Bom was filling the empty space of the members with songs
=
And it's really amazing
=
That microphone color is the microphone index used by 2 Anyone members.
=
It's like a little mermaid.
I think it's really Liz
=
I wanna give it back to you
=
I don't know how many times I see this .. There aren't many singers like Park Bom .. Clock ticking 13 times.
=
Park Bom is a unique singer
=
Queendom was like a real fandom fight ....
ㅠ
=
You you you. [you] for three times .... this is a touch stage
=
I miss you so much.
=
Thank you for making such beautiful music with your singing and singing skills. It's kind of courageous music. ♥
=
Let's be happy spring!
=
I'm not the queen, but the emperor.
=
Oh really tears. The fact that 2NE1, which filled my student life with the best hits, is now over again, and I feel more tearful because Park Bom seems to miss them more than anyone else. Cheer up!
=
I love you ❤❤❤❤❤
Too perfect a stage I can't go back, I can't go back, there's no place to go, but I can give back the feeling of the moment
=
You're good at singing. I keep talking with my eyes.
=
Now my heart .... Spring is always good. 10 years ago or now. The brave brother composer is a genius.
=
The song is good and the sound source goes first. But the stage was so good. Who dressed it? ㅡ ㅡ
And in-ear ㅠㅠ Pomi said to keep falling, but my sister still can't dance .. Last performance. Dance ㅠㅠ Contribution
=
Oh I can't really dance but I'm so cute
=
Park Bom!! From the very first E & I, Han, scarecrow, snow nose, and even this song. It was good to hear good songs so far. And today the stage was good and was impressive!
=

The last dance on the bottom of the in-club album, also the in-club dance.
=
Minji cheering video when I came out I was crying really .. Park Bom looks so sad just too sad ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
How much did you want to say that I've been pouring out all the words that I've put in my heart now
=
It was so pretty that I was a blonde in Park Bom's trailer.
=
You're so sad you miss you on Instagram Live
=
I thought I was really tearing up watching 2NE1 ... ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I will continue to cheer Park Bom sister ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The last dance is funny and I'm really sad ... I know what that dance is, and every single part of the stage is all about rice cakes
=
My sister just walked the flower road
=
I'm still happy right now, because the dismantling of 2NE1 won't make the fans go away.
=
It's the concept of girls who are sitting and looking at the end, but as soon as I think Park Bom is a real queen, I only think about this.
=
The stage was cool ~ I've enjoyed a good stage ~ Good job ~ ^^
=
Rest
Do you want to miss like Park Bom?
=
I'm not really making a mistake even though I keep falling in my ears (in?)
=
I cried with my real Minji sister and I stood in the middle of three microphones but I didn't know what to do.
=
Ranking is not important
All the stages were really precious and good. I just want to see you again.
=
1 minute 52 seconds in-ear missing ... usually embarrassed and make a mistake really great ... sister is really cool and sing well and the best
=
It was sixth grade but it was first place for me !!! I loved the stage. I felt like I saw artwork!
=
I was creepy.
=
Long song titles are popular these days
=
What a young Parkbom in 2NE1 days is really crying ...
=
Park Bom is pretty ..
=
If you look at it only by emotion, I'm tearing it up
=
Pendulum No.1 in my heart You've always been the best for me
=
Satisfied with watching this stage regardless of rank
=
Spring sister keep singing ... ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Real tears
=
I can't keep my mouth shut because of my sister.
=
Park Bom Legend video. The finalization was all about Park Bom, which was really cool. I love you sister
=
It's like the lyrics are coming together
=
Please reunite 2NE1 TT TT TT TT TT TT ㅠㅠㅠ TT TT TT.
=
I've been watching the real Queendom stage, and there's nothing as warm as Park Bom's stage.
=
Mnet can't believe in voting.
=
I've been watching a few times, but tears are a lot. I didn't have regular fan activities, but I loved them so much.
=
It's really crazy .. Chew on stage by myself. Queen. Park Bom or who's queen?
=
Park Bom has been dancing since 2NE1 ㅋㅋㅋ I feel weird and uncomfortable because I can't dance 1 I feel so cute I'm so cute.
=
I can't wear it because it's too cute. I can't get it.
=
It's sad because calling you 3 times in "You Always Be Together" calls every 3 members of 2ne1.
=
Stage production is crazy from the beginning ...
=
You've always been together, this part
It's too salty because it looks like Minji CL Dara.
=
Ha .... I like it when I sing myself .....
In the meantime, the first person sitting across from Park Bom was envious .......
=
01:52 I didn't make any mistakes until the end of this time ...
=
Park Bom, I'm the 1st place in my heart ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom is my number one ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Every single stage reminds me of the old days
=
It looks great and tears come again How can I make this stage alone? TT TT TT TT
Every time I see you, tears ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I think it's the first time to listen to songs and cry. Really four mics ring too much and voices and lyrics too.
=
2NE1 Let's be happy together ㅠㅠ
=
It's the first time I'm trying to tear more than a real video. I think it was a song I wrote in 2NE1, but the performance was crazy.
=
It's like I'm singing with my heart and wanting to go back to the last two days.
=
Every time I see Park's stage, I feel new and creepy.
=
Irreplaceable
=
When I listen to this song, I can't go back to a student who liked Tunny One, and I miss it like Park Bom misses the members.
=
The words goodbye
2NE1 I ended up with the song goodbye
=
Somehow tears come
You're Minji Ciel Daradani, and maybe they cried with this song.
=
Tears ...
=
Amishin 2NE1 mic color
I think it's really tears
=
Tears burst when there were four standing microphones on stage ...
=
I was really crazy, so I saw Mamamu on stage first ... I thought it was the reason I really liked it.
=
I think it's the last time I've been ... It's you
I love you ~ Forever Blackjack NOLZA
=
No matter what, your nose gets grimaced every time you hear it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is over 10 times ㅠㅠ
=
Today's live is the best ... Classes that fill your stage with your voice.
=
Park Bom is the best
=
Why did you search for Queen Yum Queen and stay away from Park Bom Bay? I'm mistaken at first but it's too ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Please rejoice everyone Chalin (CL) finally succeeded in YG !!!!!!!
=
Why is this stage sixth place?
=
After 2 years of real school days together 2NE1 TT TT TT Even if you wait for a few years, I want to see the stage with four people Thank you for showing the wonderful stage with Queendom Sister is always the queen of the music world
=
Ah .. Really .. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Microphones are put together as if they were together ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Spring sister uh uh 2NE1 I would like to have a stage once ㅠㅠ
=
It's sad that I can't see this now. Spring's voice is good.
=
What are you doing wrong? Do you pull tears from my eyes?
=
It's just awful ...
=
Let's go to Queendom 2 cl
=
You've done well enough.
=
TT TT TT I'm missing, but it's so cool to keep making mistakes ...
=
I saw you crying ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Mike 4
Dog ... I miss you ㅠㅠㅠ
I love you all the time
=
I've got a lot of throats.
=
Every time I watch this stage, I think it'll be good when I think of 2NE1. TT I don't know how many times I always cheer.
=
I was watching tears, but I laughed at my sister who danced at the end. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I love spring.❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
The expression was so cool ...
=
I'm going from the first note .. Your voice is unique.
=
Red hair is Parkbom Parkbomum 2ne1 where Parkbom dance and vocals go together
=
4 mics by color ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Today I was so busy watching the stage of the stage My first and last idol 2ne1 I'll be supporting all 4 people until the day I meet again I'm forever Blackjack❤️
=
When I listened to the sound source, it was just a match. But I did not see live stage but I thought I would vote for Park Bom. Park Bom's authenticity was felt.
=
Thank you for singing
=
You you you three times, it's really sad.
=
It was so touching and wonderful stage Spring ㅠㅠ Thank you for doing my best till the end Thank you for singing and directing ㅠㅠ I love you spring ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I had 4 microphones and my heart was so sick.
=
I feel really sincere and longing ...
=
What do you do because you're lovely?
No, my sister's class is so different
=
The stage floor is like 2NE1 mini album cover.
=
It's unique
=
I think I want to see CL Minji Dara.
=
The words “I miss you” and “Goodbye” are the songs of the first and sad genre of 2NE1. 0:49 2:09
=
At first, what's the concept of this? ... but when I watched the video comments, it's wow ... No, it's 4 standing microphones I thought of 2NE1, but there are other things ... I knew that I couldn't get any more attention ...
=
Wow ... I really want to see 2NE1
=
This is a legend and this is a queen
=
I think I want to go back to the old park.
=
Park Bom is singing
=
I'm alone now, but let's get together again ~ ❤️
=
I still don't know why the end of 2NE1
=
Red hair, fluorescent floor, four microphones and lyrics. I miss 2010.
=
01:40 My tears button ... This song is really ㅠㅠㅠ 4 group group watching the old 2ne1 really came to mind a lot .. My sister is the number 1 in my heart I want to do a lot of music!
=
Why didn't Dine stop dancing in spring ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Do not cry ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's 2ne1 generation ... Tears are falling.
=
She said in an IG live that the you you miss you so much part, by saying you 3 times she means Minzy, Dara and CL. Quite sweet
=
4 mic seats, so 2ne1
=
I love you spring, we're waiting for the whole Wonni one❤ We know that the rank was low, but the fans were so wonderful and valuable that they shed tears.
=
It's so cool. I'm alone.
=
Mike is so sad. Really ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Thank you very much for coming out of Queendom and I hope to win in the future.
ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Spring was really hard. I was so eager to see the video letters, and I cried as I pulled out the toilet paper Yola. Redhead really reminds me of the old days. I'm planning to squeeze out all of my moisture. I love you a lot
=
Park Bom is happy. I only walk on the flower road.
=
It's really hard to do this stage alone, but it's really hard work except for solo singers. My sister ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Best, I went to the concert when I released my crush album and it was the best choice for my life. I'll do blackjack forever.
=
The tone is really strong too ...
=
Why can't I do this?
=
I'm doing everything I want to do. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ,, This stage is so cool, and on the other hand, I'm so sad., I really want to join 2NE1 once. It's hard for spring sister to be alone, and I have a member who wants to be with you. How sad it is that we can't be together. I'm really sad and so good.
=
I love you Park Bom ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's a big hit!
=
I'm so sad.
=
Spring Sister's Ending was really a queen I loved you so much I love you!
=
Spring is my sister
=
It was so cool. I will support my future activities. I always love you.
=
I watched this video so I cried and watched the old Ms. Wonwon one. I looked so happy in spring and I really enjoyed it with the members. I smiled as I smiled. Even though I stood alone in Queendom, I was so cool and cool.
=
It's good to see who is mistaken and keeps sticking to the ear.
=
This is chew
Real tear gland tears
=
I'm tears.
=
sad..
=
I can't go back I can't go back I can't go back Parkbom .. I feel like I'm following me. Don't be lonely. Lyrics are so sweet.
=
Wow ... I had a lot of doubling and a bad breath when I first performed, but it didn't look good in the performance condition.
=
2NE1 I want you to reunite soon ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I went to the concert and went to the studio was great .. When will I have a good chance?
=
I like spring song so much !!!!
But when I look at the lyrics, tears come out .. TT TT ♥ I think of 2NE1 "You and you" part of the lyrics is Minji Dara CL.
I hope someday 4 people will come together ♥
Our blackjacks are waiting for you all the time. I miss you so much. I like you to sing, dance and enjoy on stage.
=
I've been creepy all the time.
=
Real spring sister's heart was a song that was well conveyed and was a stage TT ㅠ I hope you can be together again, but I can always support you ㅠㅠ!
=
I love you so much spring, I hope you will leave a lot of stages with sincerity ❤️
=
I hope you'll come out with exciting new song
=
Even though alone among many groups, Park Bom seems to be splendid by itself. On the other hand, it seems so lonely that it would be so good to reunite 2NE1.
=
When I took an ad with Lee Hyo-ri, Park Bom didn't have ah ㅎ ㄷ ㄷ ㄷ
=
Why is this earthquake TT TT TT lyrics so sad again ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ha ...... I really think about 2NE1 today
=
At the end, I go up to the stage and dance alone.
In the club first introduced choreography,
In the club's first lyrics are “I'm trying to erase your fragrance.” ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
I say that, but the contents of the club say I will forget it, but I can't forget it because I feel like Park Bom's feelings
=
I see you tried a lot.
=
I'm not a fan. Why are you crying? I lived in a junior high school student who was happy with my friends while listening to 2NE1 songs.
=
Real Park Bom song is so good TT ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Real Queendom
=
Real respect .. So cool.
=
Park Bom's red hair makes me think of when I'm go away and when I can't nobody
=
I burst into tears at the microphone.
=
No dance ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Contribution 웡
=
You've worked hard even if you lose one in-ear.
Sensitivity
=
I love spring really
=
Nanges. Habis skincare aku TT TT nyesal pakai awal2
=
2ne1's mics on the bottom album
=
Blackjack is Johnber!
What's up !! We're 2NE1 !!
=
I hope everything goes well without crying
=
I'm so good at alone
=
Another giant ... Park Bom ...
=
The fact that the idol album sales coming out of this stage together add up to 2NE1 ...
=
This was the best
=
Ah sullen ...
=
Although I didn't know that there was a legend called 2NE1, I loved it when I came back to Park Bom. I enjoyed looking at the old 2NE1 songs
Thank you so much for singing.
I will always support you!
=
Park Bom is still cool.
=
I don't know because Performers can't see it properly because of the Mnet camera composition.
=
I was sad when I saw this on TV but I'm not a fan
=
Why do tears come ...
=
Best
=
Park Bom is really amazing
=
My sister's gel is pretty, my sister's gel shines
=
I've been a fan since my debut, but I always cheer for you.
=
I've been crying at the stage. I want to hear bright things from now on. I've been tired so I want to see Park singing brightly. I think I'll cry in another sense at that time. ㅎㅎ Cheer up!
=
Isn't it a voluntary departure?
=
Bom, you're the best, so pretty
=
Honestly I did my best today
=
Without the last shoulder dance, it's a win today.
I can feel that nobody can beat me by singing
=
Just make it all your own song ;;;;;;
=
Park Bom's purpose in Queendom was clear. I decided to appear to convey my sincere desire to miss 2NE1, not to compete for ranking.
Every song that came out of Queendom contains heartfelt feelings. (I heard yg when I heard one song.
In particular, the last stage .. ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ I was so sad when I screamed trembling and the last in the club dance also seemed to put that performance at the end. Alone hard. I felt that I was dancing hard .. A dance that really meant a lot ...
And unless you're a fan, I don't know the hidden meanings on this stage .... I'm sad because I'm crying.
=
TT TT The girl group who shared the days that conveyed happiness and joy in my brilliant and painful days, and the wonderful people that everyone in the world knows ..
Every time I listen to Park Bom's song, I remember the memories of that time

As I watched this stage, I felt like a queen who was steadfastly and calmly leading the country.
It was a stage that made me think that Queen was really Park Bom.
But if you look at this stage, these people are the best. If you see that stage, they are the best. I look forward to your loyalty
All the cast members are wonderful people, and they've gone through my mind, and I can't tell you the queens and the first place. It's just cool. How can you number it?
Bottom Line: Queendom Best Chan I want everyone to be happy and excited than now.
Oh, I'm dizzy. I'll see you five more times.
=
I'm happy that I know 2NE1.
=
I feel sick
=
1:35 Ahh .. As soon as I see the members standing microphone color Oh, I miss you wanting to go back to 2NE1.
Moreover, the choreography of 3:40 is also the choreography of IN THE CLUB.
=
I think it was the best stage.
=
This hurts soooo much ㅠㅠ I ’m soo sad ... all those little details of the performance, she really puored her heart out into this ..
ahhh how I miss those 2ne1 days too ...
=
Lyrics of the night that hid in the words of goodbye.
=
color of mic ㅠㅠ my heart
=
Park Bom I love you forever, support you forever, sing forever❤
=
The song is so good
=
I cried than I really ... ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Tears are good for singing.
=
I love you spring
=
I cried while I was watching my sister. My fans are now in their mid-20s, so I don't have time to visit them. I'll be cheering for them. Like me.
=
The song is the best
=
I watched the stage and thought it was 2NE1.
=
Park Bom !!!
=
Can't we do 2ne1 again? Miss you
=
Oh, it's not a 2nd generation, but I don't really like it.
=
You really like my treasure!
=
3 masterless mics ... I almost shed tears as I watched. Park Bom did a great job.
=
I want to go back ... You've always been together. you. you.
I'm so sad to see you want to go back to 2ne1. I'm sad about 4 microphones, and I'm so sad about calling you 3 times.
=
I came in to get some rest and packed all the shit.
=
I cried as soon as I saw the microphone.
=
I couldn't do it because I missed it, but I just did it.
=
Park Bom has voted. The song itself was my best taste.
=
I liked it since I drew 2A1 activity
Right now, Park Bom is good. If you announce new songs next spring ,,
=
I'm singing
=
The tone is unique
=
Is it a live one?
=
Oh ... sister ... I'm really tearing ... Mike ... You you, your ambassador.
=
Wow, Mike and the back dancer are two and one person, so sad and real.
=
I was impressed when I first heard it
=
I love this stage so much ... It should be number one
=
There is no one who knows as active as 2NE1 who can't help but cry while watching this stage.
=
The sound source is so good that I keep listening, but the stage production is really ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ TT ㅠㅠ Too sad and squeaky members will be so touching ㅠㅠ ㅜㅜ
=
I'm the only singer and group I liked, but this time I was soaked in memories once again ㅠㅠ Minji's video report letter We've cried together since spring ㅠㅠ I'll wait for you!
=
Wow ~~ It's so good, please don't touch your face Please don't grow old until the end of forty years much better,
