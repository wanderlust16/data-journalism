If it wasn't for this stage, the Queendom quality would be done in the music room or anything else.
=
I'm Jyp sm yg, I'm the 3rd big company ...
I believe we will set up an agency later. President
=
Cube: How are you?
So Yeon Jeon:
ㅇㅋ ......
=
If Sujin is a snow-white snow princess, Minnie is like an Egyptian queen .. like Cleopatra.
=
Ratata lyric also look terribly stylish. The expression is not edible. It's hard to say one by one, but the addictive fragrance is mixed up, the ignition of the beginning, the walk on the fire, and the meaning that leads to something scary and rhyme. The lyrics are written by So-yeon alone.
=
Two million kids came out of Queendom
=
It's like the children brought a princess to each country
=
If you go to Dankon
=
Let's just pass the cube to Jeon So-yeon
=
Children are well balanced Jeon So-yeon Sujin Minni Woo-gi Characters are counting. If the character is all strong in it, it would have been its own way
=
It's one of the few groups that can make their debut as a hit.
=
The children's stage has raised the overall level of the Queen's stage competition. Let's go
=
My personal sentiment: this stage not only informed more people, but also held at least juniors (special evaluation team trainees), aroused seniors ('ah! I thought even the gram was awakened (the audience rating jumped up after this stage. It doubled.) The crew was excited and called the production meeting. Probably long memory.
=
I feel it every time, but I think I use foreign members very well. It's not just to gain fans in the member countries, but to make good use of the characteristics of foreigners.
=
When produced 101
Jang Geun Suk says you are the cube-chan
I've heard a similar sound .....
Then was A ...? It was .....
Now it's a cube hidden gem ..... ㅎㅎ
Genius
=
Really until this time, the Latata Gasson Legend stage; But after the finals, it's the best song I've ever seen
=
The kids were really unique. I had a performance in the shaman concept that I've never seen before, and the memorizing spells in front of Minni would be regretted if I saw them at the scene.
Jeon So-yeon, who constituted such a stage, is a Gaejaejae.
=
I think it was really magical to sing along with other groups at the end.
=
It's like a little princess from each country, but it's not like a sharala princess, but a great heir to the future.
=
Ryan's children have dragged me to this point I can't stop it
=
The introduction keeps on creepy .. It is imagined that the woman of Imotep is resurrected together in the mummies, whispering love, and keeps the viewer curious.
=
Jeon So-yeon, I know how you can chew all the way in Survival.
=
Sujin-> Blackened Snow White
Minni-> Egyptian Queen
Rainy season-> Gapbun Maltese
=
You have to be the first team. You have a unique talent. Soyeon is good, but you have members who followed.
=
And Jeon So-yeon planned it all. ?? I'll take it to Cube Jeon So-yeon
=
There are few years in the year, but all videos have the highest views ,,
Find out how attractive the group is
=
Jeon So-yeon who enjoys a huge arrangement + stage craftsmanship + Mnet Survival's third survival.
=
I think it'll be enough for BTS.
=
If I'm an entertainer, I'll recruit my kids and support them as hard as bts.
=
The children's first place was the most similar to the original song
Some other teams are just watching the music stage
=
I know why Jeon So Yeon is a genius. Arrangement, stage grip, sense. Most of all, he wrote a lot of songs.
=
There were more than 10 million views, and other participating groups had articles, but the children seemed to be unable to support their company properly.
=
Minnie knows you're summoning demons on stage.
=
Jeon So-yeon is really scared of the real song ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ In the video, all the seniors are singing along with Eve Day Evil Knight Latata.
=
It's also a good thing that the hit song is the debut song.
=
2:11 When Jeon So-yeon is caught, Jeon So-yeon's laughing at the camera.
=
No matter how much I could make Jeon So-yeon better than this stage
=
Solka Jeon So Yeon
I'm alone with my idea.
How much do you like the agency?
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius. I've been watching her since her debut, but she's almost done with group songs. How much more will you be in the future
=
I think it's a big girl.
=
Principal Principal Soyeon is a cruel fairy tale to try to kill the shaman Minnie by walking with her shaman Minnie.
=
Am I really dropping Amnet's Jeon So-yeon?
=
I only upload cubes to Soyeon three times a day.
=
I'm looking for Korean. I'm creepy. I'm looking for Koreans ㅠㅠ Please share with me creepy things ㅠㅠㅠ
=
If the members have different personalities or colors, it can be difficult because the group doesn't fit well.
=
00:51 Miyeon closed her eyes and thought she was next to Jeon Soyeon. ....Oh my
=
I'm the newest member of the Queendom group, but I think I have the best rice.
=
If you look at this group a bit, it looks like you made a mosaic craft by gathering various colors of silk fabrics ... it's unique and unique to blend in and out. If you care about your appearance program and support Cody only as you do now, you can draw a real idol history. There is no discord within the team and there is no problem with your company. Please don't worry about other eyes.
=
Jeon So-yeon's debut at PewDue is not really a concept of God, so there's too much ~ ❤️
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius, even if you look at him, and the members who follow Soyeon-yi are so great.
=
Jeon So-yeon's producing power, stage performance, and members' concept firepower are so well revealed. I've taken all my heart.
=
Minnie I just finished the intro and whispered like a ratata. I think it's crazy.
=
This was the beginning of the legend.
=
Personally, if the kids didn't stage this much in the first round, legend stages (ex. Destiny or Nanahae) didn't come out in the next round.
=
I feel it every time I see it, but the shoes have increased a lot more at the beginning of my debut! It's getting better .. I'm looking forward to it.
=
I just won everything in the intro .. Real surprise. Jeon So-yeon How do you think about making this intro. And Minnie Shaman role is so perfect .. I saw Snow White Cruelty fairy tale on stage. It's been a year, but it's just the best.
=
Intro Real Legend !!
The atmosphere, the feeling of ordering, the mysterious language and the acting of Minnie's facial expressions are overwhelming.
The rainy season is so cute
=
Hey cube, you don't do anything, just two. Gemstone + Let's support the artists.
=
I'm scared when I first do Thai and Ratata ... I'm scared.
=
It's like princesses, but it's not just Sharalah but Aladdin Jasmine.
=
Now, I think I should have prepared a lot for the first stage of the children's stage.
=
Su-Soo Jin Who's scared of this?
=
I would like to do this one more time at Mamma Melmu ..
=
Oh, I really love you so much.
=
Ratata's part looks like Miyeon's really good with the tone
=
Please do this at the end of the year, please.
=
And Minnie Intro are really scared ... I feel like I'm cursed
=
I'm not crazy, I'm so good, I'm so good The opening is unique and addicted I keep seeing it ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I came to see you again.
=
0:55 There's nobody in this part. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Sujin, when I walked out, I thought there would be a black princess who would appear in Maleficent.
=
The great things Jeon Soyeon did for this contest:
Minni Intro Idea by Jeon So-yeon
The shaman concept is also produced by Jeon So-yeon.
Costume Concept Stage Concept
This is my debut song, and songwriting is written by Jeon So-yeon
This contest is arranged by Jeon So-yeon
So-yeon Jeon
=
The number of times is different
=
I'm another fan, but the girls are open.
=
It's not what the other teams are doing ... They've been arranged by a whole wall ... Who starts in Thai ... I've run out of cheats ... I love kids.
=
I don't have any male visitors.
To show our children more (;;
=
This is twelve million times ... Ryan, too.
=
Honestly, I didn't know that this stage would come out, but Jeon So-yeon goes beyond that ... Really ...
=
I love you
=
Ah So Yeon is just the best to eat her
=
I keep coming back.
Jeon So-yeon is so good
=
This is Jeon So-yeon's genius! How many rata versions do you have?
=
It seems like this is the first time a group has placed foreign members in the right place. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This member used his language as well. Like heaven sent to children
=
I really love Soyeon. How did you prepare for this stage?
=
Since the original song is Jeon So-yeon, I have to play with a real song. ,, Genius Field Soyeon ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Director Jeon So-yeon is the best!
=
Jeon Soyeon is a genius
=
It's really genius, younger than me.
=
Jeon So-yeon's Pewdue fell from Shinhan Han-soo.
=
I love the kids concept so no exit
=
Wow ~ 10 million hits. Fire and Ssang ten million!
=
Cube bows down to the members who play the arrangement, and Jeon So-yeon keeps his feet on the ground.
=
Say I don't like it and I'm shocked
I don't feel it
Someone who came to Zhengzhou
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius
=
Jeon Soyeon's vocalization ... Let's finally Ebide ~ Ebitna-chan ~ rat! Plugs into the ear
=
Wow. Crazy stage.
The real one members are precious women ..
=
Seriously you should come out with this version.
=
There are many members who seem to eat only the leftovers among other groups, but Jeon So-yeon's dressing up is like a twelve-up table.
=
I think Minni's role in the introduction is really good ... Jeon So-yeon is a genius in the idol.
=
I'm still curious that this song was inspired by the Gacon. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's really amazing .... crazy.
=
Honestly, Minnie had a distinctive and strange voice, so if she was grouped together, she couldn't be good at it. She seems to always make the song really stand out and make Minni's voice stand out.
=
I'd like to hear the Queen's version of the Latata sound.
=
All the girls in Korea come out of Queendom. I love you, Shiva. I'm 7 years old.
=
I'm just going to see you guys. I have Jeon So Yeon, but all members support everything Jeon So Yeon wants.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius
It's younger that Jeon So-yeon's overall production was complete, including choreography, choreography, and costume concept.
=
The Queendom stage is over 10 million and three of them are kids lol
=
Jeon So Yeon writes and composes a song, so I understand the stage perfectly.
=
I didn't know this time ... I'm going to be polling Jeon So-yeon.
=
Why do those guys keep holding me
=
I'm overlooking Sujin when I dance in the children, but Jeon So-yeon dances too well. Sujin is a fatal and pretty dance. Jeon So-yeon's planning and grasping power is so bad that I can't mention it.
=
Even more scary ... Jeon So-yeon during this period of the contest, the seniors are getting inspiration about the future song through the stage ..... LOL
=
From the introduction to the ending, I'm very crazy .. Minny's introduction is crazy. Especially, all the arrangements are made by Jeon So-yeon. I can't express it except the word Genius.
=
Shu Hua makes her baby tea pack.
Like a baby
=
I went to see other teams to raise the expectation because I was the first place. I watched this last time. I didn't really skip it. I stopped and woke up .. The real arrangement choreography atmosphere.
=
This is not a performance, but an art on stage.
=
Congratulations on your 1st contest for our children❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
LATATA Jeon So-yeon wrote the composition of the members to the utilization ㄹㅇ If you are a director is a Guardiola class
=
I don't invite you to mama What are you doing?
=
Honestly, the stage composition was ant
=
Jeon So-yeon's true story; Girls' group singers come out to study;; ㅋ ㅋㅋ
=
But I can see that Shuhwa dances a lot better.
=
I'm so proud. I'm so proud and happy that I want to wave this idol
=
Jeon So-yeon's songwriting was very powerful here. Because it was his own song, you probably understood it best and you know how to do it.
=
Why is this guide for me?
=
It's true that the kids are new, but the core is not as good as the girl group 1
It's so cool and cool that this video is not the core fan's mingming duck, but really popular choice.
It doesn't mean that the core fan's summing is bad and it doesn't mean that it's cool that a rookie is rated this much!
=
Minnie sells more seriously .. and ..
I really liked only girl idols.
=
⍤⃝ looking at the stage creepy 6 times
=
1:48 i just want to say that sihun looks so cute ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The reaction is so funny. You really support me. Real cube supports Jeon So Yeon ... Real Jeon So Yeon ,, So So Yeon, So cool.
=
Queendom is the biggest beneficiary of girls. Since I'm the youngest, there's no pressure on the rankings, but it also supports my skills. There is someone who knows how to make a song, so you can design stage productions, concepts, and arrangements more freely than any other team. It was noticeable from the opening performance stage, but it showed the black magic concept properly at the main stage lol. Mamamu is known to be very good, but the children are relatively well-known teams. It's like a group of 5-6 years looking at the stage
=
I'm in my mid 30s, and this is my first time knowing the name of each girl group
=
So Yeon-a don't forget to save all the money and set up a company with the children !!!!!!
=
I don't know anything else, but please take the cube with Jeon So-yeon ... Everybody's voice is unique, so if you do not go wrong, you can't match it.
The other group members' faces looking at the stage look like my face
=
Ah, it's like memorizing spells in Thai. Creepy
=
Now, I think there's just one genius and one stage genius in this young group.
Lee Jung-yoon and Hyun-ah who had planned a lot of success in 4Minute, and Beast also wrote the song Yong-joon 0, Dancing shoes, Pentagon triple-h and Hyun-h kids, This is Jeon So-yeon and Sujin
=
Arranged round
=
Jeon So-yeon is going to produce an idol group afterwards as an agency. It seems to know exactly what the public wants and what trends are appropriate for the times.
=
10 million !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
I love you Sujin sister ㅠㅠ Oh I'm really going to do real children gathered princess from each country ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ Oh I'll be back I really chewed on stage ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Like Jeon So Yeon's Minnie card
Minnie seems to know too well where to match the peculiar feelings
+ Ata! It's awesome ~ ^^ Thank you 9.8 thousand
It's not a big deal but it feels so nice ~ (; ~>) ♡
=
I really don't believe it's the youngest group.
=
Tutu tutu tutu tutu tutu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu
=
It's like the best idol arrangement ever. I don't know who arranged it
=
Something from the intro ... I've seen a horror movie summary.
=
I'm watching a couple of times ㅠㅠ I'm sick and tired of dying
=
Minnie vocals have good weight. Looks good with this song
=
Haha I'm so cool
=
The real children have a unique feeling to be members .. As well as using the atmosphere that Minni is really good at, Sujin is also the first time. Sujin was hit three times by the dance line ...
=
Who's scared of something? ;;
=
It's all done with latata lol
=
It's so good to see Shuhwa on this broadcast.
=
I love children
=
I'm filming a queen on Mnet.
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Everyone like a rat who follows a pipe.
=
The children are like the gods of Queendom uh oh jeon yeon oh rap and this latata Minny magic and arranged the original good song shine more Always make a good song but the idea is really good and long run as a group❤
=
4:03 4:03 Really good.
=
I saw this too much and memorized the Thai part.
=
Foreign
I really enjoyed the advantage of having an inmate.
=
It's really ...
=
3:41 Sujin, it's awesome. I'm creepy.
=
What should I do ... I really like Jeon So Yeon because I'm so genius.
=
If you gave me this sound
=
3:41
Sujin is pretty ~~~
=
Wow, it's really awesome. I usually think it's better if you arrange the original song, but it's too bad.
=
It's a great arrangement to keep watching.
=
This crazy thing. I do everything I want to do ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The singer who sings the song given by the composer or the producer is also a singer, but the singer-songwriter who sings the song he wrote can really express the color of his song. Cheers to Jeon So-yeon who showed her song in a different color!
=
3:41 Sujin, really ... Kilpo ... Who's scared? ㅠㅠ Sister's face is scary.
=
3:54 It's like a civilization follows a real spell.
=
When it comes to spell-related languages, Latin comes to mind, but I didn't even know that Thai was such a fascinating language.
=
Rainy, Minni's voice is a real sniper.
=
Don't be fooled by your agency. Quietly support Soyeon and give him lots of money. If Ulsoyeon is ruined
=
I'm really good at arranging ...
=
I'm not kidding because I'm good at it. I wanted to do something you didn't even try.
=
Jeon So-yeon who selects songs genius and children members who perfectly digest it,
How did these talents come from the cube?
=
Intro decadent Buddhism It's not a joke because Thai speaks Thai
=
0:39 The black-and-white conversion is a real godsend.
=
It's been a while since I debuted, but it's not a joke
=
I'm really hard and passionate. My debut song is a hit. I love real kids.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius, I don't say this well, but I've been creepy watching arrangements and stage planning skills. I hope more people know this fact.
=
The children seemed to show the most complete stage
=
The stage looks really delicious
=
I saw Lovelyz Queen Achu and YouTube recommends this.
=
Jeon So-yeon's genius and the great members who express him are the other talents that Jeon So-yeon wants to express.
=
I keep seeing it again, it's creepy .. ㄷㄷ
Opened
=
Just crazy ... Wow ...
=
There is only one Jeon So-yeon who has made a profit because he did not debut. It would not have been the top of the list when IoI entered, and the atmosphere was diminished, and Ioia itself was a cute concept.
=
What are these guys? What are you doing?
=
The rainy season is so good. There are not a lot of people who like rainy season.
=
Jeon So-yeon should be designated as a national treasure ...... Minnie is a number of gods.
=
This is my sound source
=
The stage that marked the beginning of the legend
=
Why did you not come to Melmu?
=
If you're like Kingdom, you'll kill ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's a whole person who sells cubes ... It's so amazing to see only the talented people who haven't really worked.
=
If you think about it now, Pic Michu is Jeo So-yeon, who is a talent who can do everything from vocal judge rap judge dance judge to concept producer.
=
03:42 From this point on, the best of all the people to follow the lyrics as if they were really ...
=
It's really good to be black and white at first
=
When I made LATATA, I thought that I made it because I felt it was a spell. .....,
=
Miyeon's Legendary is so cute ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Replying to @Daniel_Wolf
=
I don't know how many times I look back .. So-yeon Jeon is really a genius. Sujin's facial expression and dance are really amazing.
=
Replying to @David_Gill
=
The first thing that came to my mind when I was on stage was ...
Honestly, when they came out, they would remix and sing and cover themselves, especially when the children almost broke the dance composition, arranged, and ...
=
Among the older sisters, Gise boy, Shuhwa is so pure.
It's like a baby playing with a teddy bear between knives and sisters fighting with guns ... ♡
=
3:41 I really loved my sister.
=
The real children are Jeon So Yeon.
Acknowledgments Joa-kuk
=
It looks like a real queen ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It's so pretty Oh I think I'm in the mouth
=
Personally, the idea was that they were the newest. ㅠㅠ I really tried to suck the people who looked really well. It went so well.
=
This is an idol and this is a singer
=
Just good at this time.
=
It's a `` hit song contest, '' and the debut song is a hit.
=
Thank you for making your debut
=
Wow .. crazy ;; The introduction sees a creepy shoot;
What do you remember ... children only remember the stage ;;;;
=
Real concept unique !!!! So cool !!
=
3:40 Seo-su-jin is crazy ....... Crazy ..... I've seen hundreds of times. Woojin is the best ?? It looks like this
=
It seems to have brought in all the advantages that can be utilized in a real team .....
=
I felt this once again. It's so cool to see a woman like Jeon So-yeon is a real genius.
=
2:44 Wow .... I'm totally out of sight.
=
Soyeon, I'm interested in watching the debut stage, but I think they'll be the guys to the groom ~~~ ^^
I still feel a bit uncomfortable compared to my ability ~~~~~
The most loved group ^^
Cheer up ^^
=
Real children are a group that goes well with Jeon So-yeon, who are all good at digesting together so that no one should fall out.
Jeon So-yeon has the ability to save the cards that are good for the members.
=
I didn't think there would be more scary settings than this, but ...
=
Oh, I kept seeing the chickens
=
Children's Jeon So-yeon is Queen's Freddie Mercury. Soyeon in Gidle is like Freddie Mercury in Queen.
=
Wow ... you really are ...
=
2:40 When I went to Minnipart from Soyeon Lab .....
=
Miyeon looks like the best princess ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's a legend in the opening.
=
4:00 Oh, I'm a real genius
=
Genuine Jeon So Yeon's all-around genius ... I'm looking for a video to watch the Queendom, sweeping the stage and writing songs, and I can't do it without children. It's really a pro on stage. I've never liked this, but I'm really investing. Jeon So-yeon I'm envious and cool at the high level of self-esteem.
=
It's the best beeping beat from Minnie Part 1.
=
2:11 Take your sister
=
Minnie is so crazy like crazy how mysterious ?????????
=
Jeon So-yeon's only weakness is that his company is a cube. And if you want me to stand out one of the other kids' strengths on each stage. This time, Minnie's tone and nationality.
=
3:13 Wow, I think I'm going to clean my hair before I get out of his part.
=
Real arrangement too .. grand, cool and pleasant
=
Later in the game. Who's scared? I started to see the cast members followed by Latata. And the kids won.
=
This is the sound guide and what are you doing?
=
ㅇ ... it's a crisis.
=
I will shoot 10 million soon ... Let's go 10 million !!
=
Jeon So-yeon Cheon Genius ;; The concept of the medicine man was awesome.
=
I'm good at dancing ♡♡♡
=
I'm sure I'm already
I keep doing it. I keep doing it yesterday.
=
The girls are so full of clothes ... On the contrary, the shoe looks normal.
=
It looks like amber in the rainy season.
=
2:46 Real Inner Face
=
I'm creepy every time I get nnth introduction LATATA
=
Soyeon comes out, creepy 쫙 mup people really look attractive and even voice .. Really creepy I love you children
=
I'm calling along the introduction ....... Cancunni Gunja 니 ㄹ ........
=
Wow, this concept is real .. Children are unique. When I listened to the original song, I was a little shocked.
=
My favorite Sujin, but Minnie Oz every video
=
Cube can't work, but I'm also good at picking people ... ㄹㅇ I'm turning a few times a day.
=
Ana lol lol I don't care about idols
=
Introductory Minnie Thai spells like tightening
=
Please give it to melon
=
Came to see the rainy season,
=
2:11 I want you to smile longer, but I think you're dead already.
=
Jeon So-yeon and Minnie tear the stage, grind it, smash it, chop it up, and completely juice it.
=
Rice Cake Shop Cube Enter ~
=
1:26 John Zeller
=
Minni talks in the intro part as if the dreamy and beastly concept fits well.
Was this mysterious song?
=
Touching Shuhua's eyes behind 2:25
=
Jeon Soyeon has a really good hair. Cube.
=
Originally I liked the song, but I listened a lot but the girls are all so good .. !!
=
Every time I see it, Minnie that styling looks really good.
=
If this sound comes out, please ~~~~~
=
I'm really good at it.
=
Let me out, Mr. Cube.
=
0:39 Latata
3:42 Who's scared
=
Yes, it's much better to be a contest with friends who have debuted, rather than trying to grow emotionally and take on a live broadcast.
=
I guess it was hard to pick all these songs
=
I didn't know it was a group like this.
=
The more you see it, the more it becomes creepy. I've never seen such a wonderful stage.
=
Each of the members is unique and attractive, so it's unique when combined together.
=
It was the best arrangement and the best tee in the group.
=
This is also a nightmare version.
=
At first, I creeped out all over my body.
=
This song is not a composer, but it is crazy.
=
I thought this was a legend .. I also made a new legend.
=
00:18 My reaction ...
=
Arrange arrangement directing performance
I can't express myself as genius.
Just a genius
=
Before I watched this video, I knew it was just a group, but I was tired of watching this video.
=
Wow, what's up with Minnie?
=
It's a joke, but, the stage was cool ... There are a lot of handsome people in the middle middle audience.
=
Good song ♡♡♡
=
Sujin and Jeon So-yeon and Minnie are so overwhelming,
=
This is my guarantee
It's really all-around,
Whatever the atmosphere, it's a wonderful stage.
=
I've only been looking at the Queen's house and running straight. I thought I was crazy all the time ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㄹ
=
I feel like my heart is stopped
=
I love you Sujin !!!!!!
=
I think I'm cursing something in a horror movie for the first time.
=
Like pentacon, like B2B, like kids, and cubes don't work.
=
I'll guide you through the music.
=
10.27 AM 11:56 AM
11.1 million views came.
The singer's comeback MV wasn't well over 10 million
=
Why are all the princesses? They are the chiefs who must have taken part in the jungle.
=
Sujin is walking for the first time, but I think she walks in a tent secretly.
=
I told you I didn't like it yesterday I've been looking at all the children's stages since I saw the stage ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ So nice ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow,!
=
Sincerely, Jeon So-yeon producing crazy ... The shaman concept makes me feel like I've been on the stage all the time;
=
3:17 Shuhua is wrong.
=
This is the best scene to follow the order of song latata as you go to the second half
=
It's cute to follow Latata
=
I was in this video
=
Since they're on the team who produces, it's definitely advantageous for the live stage.
=
But So-yeon has real leadership.
=
Did you know that Jeon So-yeon's makeup looks like tears from a certain angle?
=
It's already crazy from the start ...
=
Next comeback That magic witchcraft is a magician or such a profound concept ㅋ ㅌㅋㅋㅋ It would be nice if there was no girl group with such a concept.
=
Jeon Soyeon looks straight and has a strong conviction, and he writes so well, he writes very well, and produces raps. Producing ability, composing, stage, concept, and creativity. The petty legend coming out
=
I don't get tired even if I see it ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No why is there no country yet
=
Jeon So Yeon, it's cool.
=
Huh, children? I first knew if there was such a team, and I first heard a song. ㅡ. ㅡ ;; It's a great choreography, great choreography, fresh and really good. Let's go to the world stage ~!
=
Thai super attractive paired
=
Wow, you're over ten million children You only have a way to go up ... Go straight ... Go up.
=
Minni was sent out early in the early days, and it was better to catch Chun So-yeon in front of Rap Mart.
=
At first, I'm looking at Minnie from a moment because I've been watching Sujin for a moment.
=
Why Jeon So-yeon is a dog writer
1. I was originally a vocal song.
2. But I want to rap and turn to rap
3. I tried to wrap it and chew it enough to eat
4. But the funny thing is that cube audition is a dance pass. Was ...
5. In the cube, the composition of the trainees was written as a kind of class, and Jeon So-yeon was also written once.
=
Jeon So-yeon, dance and sing well also c ..
=
Look at the thumbnail ..... Where is the shoe?
=
When someone is Ryan
You said you were going to the billboard.
Not the real Queendom program.
I have to go overseas
The real billboard should go unconditionally
=
Who is scared of what! Sujin
=
The other members are so dark that they suddenly became cute because of the rainy season and the shoes. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Minnie, you're like ... a bitch.
=
I came to see you today
=
Cool Miyeon
=
I don't understand that Jeon So-yeon has no country;
=
The kids are very new, and they're really good at this group of seniors.
=
Minnie-Slytherin
Shuhwa Rainy Season-Hufflefuff
Sujin Soyeon-Griffindor
Miyeon-Levinclaw
=
I think it's a good thing that I can tell the charm of the children through the Queen ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ.
=
I was shaking my hands and feet while whispering about the end of the inlet.
=
2:11 Expression ♥
=
Intro movie front
=
Egyptian version is like ratata
=
Minnie is very dedicated and memorized the excellent phrases of different languages. I like this ♥
=
It's not like you've been writing this song for writing lyrics.
=
How can I listen to this song?
=
The rainy season was cute
=
What happened to the hits? It's 1,060,000 times.
=
I have to leave more children.
=
I like latata when I first start
=
The last episode shows that Jeon Soyeon has been thinking of Lion since then,
Jeon So Yeon She's ...
=
Minnie's eyes are really sexy!
=
The real Jeon So-yeon is so crazy that he wrote the lyrics so that each member can show a balanced charm.
=
It's a big hit and it's my debut song.
=
I don't know any idols, but I've seen this stage 50 times
=
ㄹㅇ I did not see anyone, but no one has seen ... OH 500 million times I'm watching ㅁ I love children ....
=
I feel like I've been looking at five people from the trainees, so I've been thinking about it. I'm really debut. LOL
=
It's rare for a group to use a back dancer as well in the middle of the day.
=
Minnie introduction. Small smoke lapping. Who's the last one?
=
Is this the first devil's spell?
=
I'm overwhelmed with rainy season makeup at this time! Cuteness of all time ...
=
Oa .... I'm guessing children .. I've been looking for a recommendation, but I'm not a Thai joke at first. I'm feeling a bit of a Yandere. I can't escape = I will be the most beautiful moment 'and recklessly say' LOVE LOOK AT 'When I say repeatedly, I feel imprisoned somewhere underground.
=
I think we brought a princess from each country
Really ...
: Princess dress.
: What. (Lion leather in the hand
: ... I'll prepare my leather for tomorrow.
:
This feeling
The world conquest is over already?
=
It's like a shaman group that killed five hundred people ...
=
Real children are the beneficiaries of this program, so there is not much burden on the rankings, and Jeon So-yeon, among the members, can produce more singer-oriented production. In addition, there are members who live like crazy if you give a killing part like Minni or Sujin. So Yeoni's performance field is very wide.
=
Minnie sister
=
3:41 And crazy. ㅅㅂ.
=
I was really appalled all the time. How can this stage come out of my first year idol? I hope these singers go abroad and become known ㅠㅠ
=
Minnie at first, it was amanet from the film mummy.
=
Good at good
=
It's so cool that you can see it on the stage at the end of the year.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius.
=
Honestly, (g) -idle ended up with the League of Legends k-pop team.
=
Jeon So-yeon is so sorry to be active only in Korea. She's not just chic, she's just sexy, she's just like a foreign pop singer.
=
And canine
=
Mnet ... What kind of K-pop are you?
=
It was a prime time when there was a real cube beast four, but I couldn't work again.
=
The cube is the money but the rest of the kids will take care of it
=
I hope you don't see a male trainee in the middle.
=
Minni and Minni and Minni .. Minni, I'm seeing first. Minni. I feel like a voodoo man in hell.
=
I want to see Minni black lip
=
Please give me this sound source too ..
=
Shuhua, where are your hands?
=
Jeon So-yeon is really great, but Minni and the rest of the members are amazing.
=
3:42 Who's scared
=
Say I don't like Ryan, but I'm seeing 100 times.
=
Jeon So-yeon feels like a collaboration of real talent and effort
=
(Female) Children <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
=
The early spells are crazy ...
=
Was it a time to come back ... I think I've shown Jeon So-yeon so far, I've thought of a few of the interviews that I thought .. .. c .. Where is the end ...
=
Minnie's black hair, raw hair.
I love that place
=
This is really good
=
Because I work so hard
I want to shout out that cheering method
=
What kind of stage did you make? ... I think I know where to use the members.
=
To be honest, Minnie first spelled in Thai and then greyscale zoomed out, while at the same time LATATA .. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I was stunned at the moment as if it had been exposed to radiation. I feel like a stage with real magic.
=
So Yeon Jeon
Perfect combination of familiarity and color difference
It is a realm of heaven.
=
I'm here again! I hung on my order ㅠ. ㅠ 타 타타
=
I only know this team Jeon So-yeon, but when Sujin is scared of anything, he's violently accidentally.
=
3:23 ????????? The mind seems to be sleeping
=
But handsome guy caught in the middle
=
I don't know how many times I've seen Latata whispering and Jeon So Yeon's part. ㅠㅠ Real Shaman Mountain Man Holly I'm Cody and everything is perfect.
=
So Yeon-yeon, I honestly see you when you're unread
=
1:26 1:26 1:26 1:26
1:26 1:26 1:26 1:26 Cute
=
I want to see you
=
Minnie Cleopatra looks more thrilled
=
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㄲ ㄱㅋ Are you a children rookie? It's been like a girl group for a few years now. ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It looks like the female vampire hero in Minnie Monster Hotel.
=
I think Soyeon is chewing on stage alone.
=
The best ... everything ... who's scared of chicken meat?
=
Everyone's mind is the same
Honestly, everyone was creepy when you first latata?
=
Wow, the creepy keeps coming up
=
At first, Minni turns to 0:38 latata only.
=
Video
=
TT
=
Queen's Legend Stage
=
I'm a fan !!!!!!!!!!!!!, !!!, !!!!!!
=
* Please do this stage once !!!!!!!!!!!!! Please !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *
=
Wow, it's really creepy.
=
Jeon So-yeon's temperament to become an artist like Zico later ...
=
Jeon So-yeon seems to know how “familiar” becomes “fresh”
=
This is so damn iconic
=
Thailand
=
It's really cool!
=
It's tickling to make my debut song.
=
You're welcome.
=
Soon Hits 1000 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
It's another fan, but So-yeon is so amazing ... I'm arranging it.
=
I don't know if I'm feeling this way. It was a little scary and creepy because I felt like memorizing spells when I was playing in movies such as black priests or transformations.
=
Minnie, Miyeon and Rainy season are pretty princesses
=
Every time I see the children's stage, the concept of Shuhwa is clear and clear because it is clear.
This is also a power haha
=
In Shu Huatata, I only had a ratata.
=
I know and listen to almost all the songs I did in the first hit.
=
The more I sing, the more I sing along with other girl groups
=
Minny something Cleopatra? I feel that way
=
This is the highest grade of diamonds hidden in the cube. I want you to support it tightly.
=
Jeon So-yeon is not going to pack his own amount in a good taste, but to try to even the members .... Usually I'm going to chew it all.
=
Jeon So-yeon's ability to buy something really ... I think it's like a composer's senior,
=
Why are you using a ATA? ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I think they debuted again for 10 years without knowing where
=
A great group that turned the image of Thai into a song
=
Clothes style hairstyle make-up everything is perfect; Miyeon's so pretty and she's so cute and pretty on her cheeks. She's really good at dancing with her face ~
Ahn Jeon So-yeon Genius Manjae ~ So Yeon is setting up his agency ~ You're a genius producer
=
Who's scared?
=
Ha ... charlie charlie.
yes
=
Every time I look at Jeon So-yeon, I'm so genius, I just laugh. Rap, expression, gesture, performance ... Idol born to play on the real stage
=
This stage was Minnie and Soyeon was full of course.
=
I saw when it was 1 million, but after a few minutes, 9 million ,?
=
It's so cool, especially Jeon So-yeon, so versatile and not really known. Hmm, I really hope it's better. I'd like to push it out of children's colors.
=
Idols other than children shouldn't say they are artists
=
At the present time, thanks to Cube B2B and children, I've been so successful. Oh, not so far.
=
Jeon Soyeon is old and needs to be entertained.
=
Wow, I'm really creepy.
I got chicken meat I really want to certify
No, my sisters just love you ...
=
It's hard to decide on a stage concept idea, but most of them seem to be very cool from Jeon Soyeon's preparation. It's so cool to keep each member well, as if you don't even care about Soyeon and children.
=
It's only been a year since I made my debut
=
10 million views of children
=
It's better because I'm really witchcraft
=
Park Ki-ryong is a good cheerleader.
=
I keep coming back thanks to the intro ㅠㅠ Keep making me miss you ㅠㅠ
=
Of course, So Yeon goes well with the center, but I saw Minni's charisma after watching this broadcast.
Why didn't you know ...? This presence
Squid
=
And Minnie at the beginning
=
It is not unusual for stages where foreign members are placed in front
Thanks to you, I am the first to know that Thai is such an attractive language.
I want to bow to God
=
Wow, this is just a championship. I'm looking forward to the year-end awards.
=
Minnie is crazy
=
Awesome
=
So-yeon is really all-around.
I know exactly what to do ... I'll be more excited later!
=
Views
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius
=
I was in today
=
When you speak Thai ㄹㅇ devil seemed to whisper creepy ;;;
=
Lovelyz Six Senses report mental cleanup
=
Please give me this sound source
=
It's a big hit with Jeon So-yeon. Minni's unique dark and dark ambience is brought to life with a clear concept. Idols with such a concept are so precious.
=
When I vote for the final stage tomorrow
(Girls) Children (×) Girls (×)
Girls (o) Please send it without space
Spaces are invalid. ㅠㅠ
Be careful not to invalidate your important vote
Please do not send a space !!!!
=
I keep seeing Puredie's face from the rainy season.
=
I'm tired of seeing and hearing every day .........
=
ㅇㄴ I heard that the pontoon Soyeon squeezed with Shaman Minni and sacrificed Miyeon as a sacrifice. Since then, Sujin hits the wall for 3 minutes and 41 seconds, and the house became a studio.
=
I said that the company did this but I can't think that Soyeon did this ... Soyeon's planning and skills seem to be endless
=
I'm a bit witchcraft ... 5 days a day
=
I know why you're called genius.
=
Jeon So-yeon's face looks great 2:40 3:59
=
Despite being a gel rookie in my heart, I am so good and have my own color.
=
Unlocked while in a slightly sealed temple
Like witches ...
=
I watched this stage and I've been to Thai. I understand why they are children.
=
Well done.
=
I've been too late !!!!!!!! I want to go on stage !!!!!!
=
1:24
He's handsome
=
Part of the shoe that latata latata? Why are you so cute?
=
Real children hit the jackpot
=
What do you say in Thai when the consonant pronunciation of Southeast Asian is emphasized? Prejudice
It was such a mysterious feeling. It's so cool and you're going to breathe as soon as you play the video .... How do you think about putting Thai into the song?
=
1 minute 27 seconds
=
I'm in my thirties. I accidentally liked this song and found the original song. (Girls) Children Fighting !!
=
Wow .. The first part is really creepy.
ㅠㅠㅠ Soyeon is also the best arrangement Arrangement wow ... Really crazy .. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅜ ㅠ ㅠ TT TT TT children are the best. Replying to @David_Wolf
=
Soyeon saves Cube
=
I feel overwhelming somewhere so I'm afraid of Minnie's Thai
=
I didn't know about the children's group and only knew the songs. Like this was born to shaman concept ;; It's a real arrangement.
=
Minnie's heirs go well with acting like Yura
=
Minni has black hair and long straight hair.
=
Everybody has a big meal ...
=
Real children ㅠㅠ Jeon So Yeon may be the best at first sight, but the rainy season voice is unusually attractive and Minnie's voice is so crazy and Sujin is so good on the stage nowadays. It's so great, but the kids who digest this concept come to mind, just ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Kids look classy .... ㅇ 0 ㅇ
=
Arrangement true story or idols I'm getting sick every time I see a remix in the end of the stage, but Jeon So-yeon shows the class ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Working women
=
Soyeon's part looks in Miyeon's name
=
Soyeon's arrangement in the recording studio is so creepy in the main room.
=
Can you hear me i love ya Antonio?
=
1:46 Yoon Jung Hwan
1:47 Kim Si Hoon ....?
=
Wow ... there's more to say than this admiration.
=
Other female idols are also good, but Idol latata girls continue to see Really addicted taste, especially Soyeon's "rap" at the end of the rap look real ..... "Who are you scared?"
=
The only person who writes Minni so well is Jeon So Yeon.
=
Intro ㄹㅇ creepy ... The recording process Jeon So-yeon is definitely a genius in composing composition ... singing better than any composer
=
The girls didn't really like it and the song wasn't my style, but it wasn't my style.
=
The children's songs are really good and the members are really good, but it's like a fandom difference.
=
I don't see the idol program very well, only girls are sure to make their songs contests ㅆㅅ ㅌㅊ
=
Why is this high quality sound source?
=
Children are serious about the competition. Starting from this stage, the other teams are nervous and prepare a fresh concept for the competition. Especially Lovelyz destiny or aoa you guys ... Jeon Soyeon seems to be a real treasure ㅠㅠ next contest is expected more !!
=
Who's scared of that part?
=
I really like dogs.
=
3:41 I love you
=
Ratata should be seen periodically
=
Minnie Intro The Last Part Ratata! When creepy
=
The intro movie mummies?
=
0:19 Anyone know sns account? ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ??
=
Something cool
=
Soyeon, can't you make the next album with a vampire concept?
=
Wow, it's a real geography intro. Real Jeon So-yeon is a genius.
=
Wow, can't you come out with this? TT TT Queendom version of Latata, please. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Oh, I'm not afraid of the camera.
=
ㄹㅈㄷ
=
Minni's role as a shaman, but she's just tatata, so my heart is falling and my body is creepy, and when our jewel Soyeon burns this night, he makes a few songs with the same song. I turned around ...
=
You're good.
=
Ask Jeon So-yeon to take your kids and give it to you for money.
=
Why do you hate it? Why ? Why is there no? Did you not understand me? ㅇ 0 ㅇ ???
=
1:27 Isn't this Jung-hwan trainee from Pewdu?
=
Jeon So-yeon, the genius of dogs
=
I feel it every time I see someone.
=
I don't have a lot of Sujin, but every time I come out, I'll show you another idol ... I wanted to see Sujin, but I'm not a real stage play.
=
Children's first legend is like Minnie
The second one is Sujin and the third one is like Woogi and Soyeon.
=
Since Shin So-yeon's shaman concept was composed by Minni stage intro
=
I wish I couldn't shine with the audience in the middle of the stage
=
Sharpen this, too ...
=
Give Cube Soyeon sister some money.
Then do you hit more?
=
This song is a real intro
=
Minnie ... the stage master ...
=
If you don't know you're a rookie, who knows you're a rookie?
One year since their debut ...
=
No I can't imagine Jeon So-yeon wearing school uniform
=
I knew Amnet Jeon Soon wasn't enough.
=
Usually when you arrange the original song is much better but the arrangement is very cool !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
Jeon So-yeon and children sing their debut as a hit ..
=
Jeon So-yeon is really great. All the members are good, but it's especially great compared to other idols. There's no such thing.
=
If this video is higher than the video, ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ But this remake was so good
=
I feel that this stage is creepy
=
This group did a stage composition arrangement in that age and perfected it as a legend. It seems to be more sucked because it seems to be enjoyed on the children's stage.
=
The English subtitles are a bit weird. It's not to be drunk with love, but to be drunk meaning to have love.
=
Wow, everything is Soyeon
=
It seems like children are the first group in which the rapper is so central. Jeon So-yeon is a real talent and a great meal. I seemed to have grown more than when I was. The effort is great
=
The children are really great and each member's charms and abilities are great, but Jeon So-yeon, who knows how to use and use distinct members for the stage or concept, is the real ... The strongest ... Really this is a real genius.
=
Jeon So-yeon hasn't debuted in less than two years
If it's about 5 years a year, it's going to be a Korean music tycoon,
Do some work for the cube
=
The song's ignition is Seosujin
I walked forward and started coming closer to the ignition
The ignition of the second start opens toward Seosujin in order from the front.
=
No, they're really original songs, but they made a whole new song !! Choreography points, choreography finished and feeling of the song is completely different from the original song!
=
Jeon So-yeon or Lim Hyun-sik or Huina (cube composer Samdaejang) ... By the time you join the cube, you have to audition for your own songs.
=
What's cool about children is that it's fun to see their talents. And I'm listening to Seonurita Latata etc. Gochujang is a famous gochujang that makes the delicious green bean sprouts, green bean sprouts, and green bean sprouts together. The team members look good, the music color is clear, fun, good coordination.
=
Even though I'm a girl, I want to take a look at Minnie once. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No ... Jeon So-yeon What if I didn't do real music No I don't want to imagine No real genius ???????
=
The Queen Queen really looks so good
=
No, it's only me who is scared when Sujin is scared ..?
=
ㅋㅋ Lara Solsol Pa ~, Papa Solsol La ~ <-This is the loop, how old is Jeon So Yeon?
=
It's not charismatic pranks like vampires and draculas.
I don't know how many times I'm watching this video, but if you have a producing ability like Soyeon or a team with vocals that are full of vocals, you'll always be attracted to the concept whether it's right or wrong ...
=
I've seen more than 10 times on the same stage. I've never seen the same stage several times I thought crazy .. Really .. I want to see it again and again.
=
The only girls who reminded me of the freshness of the girls are I love them ..., I love children ㅠㅠ ㅠ ㅠ sisters are so pretty ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm really sorry for the intro
=
I came in a ride than ohm girl, but my real sisters have me
=
Jeon So-yeon is a young witch who is doing something and mocking up the next plan in the dark forest hut, and Sujin is a maid who covets the money that Jeon has made badly. Speaking of magic and reading in front of a bonfire. Aji (This is not a good idea.) Shu Hwa follows Sujin, and the colorful bird with long white tails is like a charismatic samurai from the palace. Black horse / tiger / ability to change into a rabbit.
=
Minni speaks Shala Shala in Thai.
Shouldn't you? Uh, just just tickle or whatever. Okay, just die.
=
It feels like a movie early in the princess wakes up mummies.
=
You can dress up Jeon So-yeon and ...
=
It's been a long time since I won the awards ceremony
=
3:41 Suzy
Ha ... I'm crazy because of you.
=
I love you soyeon ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's like everyone's shooting a legend in Queendom. I'm really good at it.
Of course, one group wrote the history of K-pop
=
2:17 Jeon So-yeon Awesome, awesome
=
Is it a cute rainy season? ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ My voice is so cute ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Every time I get out of the shoe, I'm sleepy.
=
I'm so dressed in other members' clothes
=
Look again, the Queen's Legend stage ...
=
Minnie d not a shaman? I'm always here
=
3:41 Who's scared
=
3:40 Legend
=
Rainy season cute dolphin like
=
I liked children, but I always thought that the rest of the members were lacking except Jeon So-yeon .. I think Jeon So-yeon's genius was outstanding again, but all the members digested it more than they thought. The group's kids looked really cool, great.
=
The cube is Soyeon, take it with you.
=
Jeon So-yeon's ability and members' trust combined to create the perfect stage.
=
Audience Response = My Response
=
I'm imprisoned at first, so I'm imprisoned.
=
It was a stage where Minnie could announce his name.
=
Who knows who is 1 minute and 27 seconds?!?
=
If you retire with Jeon So-yeon, please dress up one agency ... Geely than the real world will come out of the world ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I watched it ten times a day .. Kim Min-ni first came to Thailand and whispered like a latata, and Jeon So-yeon's rap is coming.
Do your kids❤️
=
I've been a fan since late last year. Charm skills are first class. I want to be the first girl group with good members. I finally see the light.
=
I'm sure it's the first to see all the singers following me, so I'm number one,
=
Girls are crazy and cheating with good looks.
=
Wow, what would you do if you didn't have a celebrity?
=
I sincerely think these guys should leave. Not a fan Girl group not sure. But I've heard all these songs, and all the real songs are fresh and the tone is not really these days. The most important thing is that the songs are really ...
=
I'm so creepy, I know why you won first place. I felt Jeon So-yeon once again.
=
I'm a real bitch ... I'm convinced why Cube was holding onto him
=
I want them to grow well. The concept of Girly + Sexy + Monghwan is so well established that the concept is roughly well grasped to the extent that anyone can listen to it.
+ What do you like a lot?
Thank you for your trembling ...
=
I was love ya so far Romeo
=
The biggest beneficiaries of Queendom are the children.
=
The introduction is frighteningly cold, but it is addictive.
=
1:27 sec. I'm just excited
=
I knew it was a talent, but it's about this ... Arrangement is crazy, and Jeon So-yeon is producing What is this lack of a genius modifier; Minni is really crazy ㅋㅋ I really like the center .. It's so creepy and intro that I can't really talk about it.
=
Sorrel
=
Sorrel
=
Jeon So Yeon shines more with members than when she sings solos. Jeon So Yeon's leadership and strong personality are not a joke. Jeon So-yeon is the perfect idol even if it's not a pure innocent face
=
AA AA AA
Burnout ”Who are you scared?” 3:42
=
Jeon So Yeon makes a great thing in a genre that the public doesn't even think of
=
If I was a child member, I would be proud to be a genius member like Jeon So-yeon
=
So Yeon's yes I'm Jeon So Yeon's confidence is so good ... Cool ... You ...
=
Minni feels a bit like Cleopatra
=
These are all cube idols, but it's because the cube is so small .. Oh Minnie. So pretty .. That bangs are so pretty. How are those pretty and distinctive dogs? And what are you doing?
=
Now let's go to 10 million views ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Minnie is a little bit like Cleopatra.
=
Why are you so cute when you do the girl concept?
=
When I first come out, I keep thinking of Lion King Scar.
=
Soyeona Cube Director Norija Cube's future lies in you
=
I started driftwood at 15 years old. If you have 100 teams who are virtuous since that age, only children have settled down. How did I get here? Ripping the lip-sync, sending the guys who don't get the concept, and the people who betray the team like eyeglasses.
=
Jeon So-yeon is great, but the members who come with it are also great.
=
3:40 It's really crazy.
=
0:33 Ahhhhh
=
If you want to be gall, you have to do this.
=
This is the biggest thing in my life
=
The original song is good, the arrangement is good too.
=
Minnie, I love you ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
No, my sister TT TT TT wrote a composer and composer stage planning is also great, I think I'm going to die. I'm dying
=
Minnie gestures are so great for children for her
=
Arrange the real song in the remix version TT ㅜ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
2:35 Beats are good.
=
I don't lie and I'm creepy from my legs
=
3:34 Awesome.
=
But this is my debut song.
=
Somehow, Soyeon looks like a spherical joint doll because of the fabric tied to her knees.
=
Wow. Intro Minnie, are you crazy?
My eyes are like a kaleidoscope in my four wheels
=
Wow ... from Ste ...
=
3:40 Soojin's expression of 'who is scared'
What are you really scared of? I think I'm trying
=
How many times do you see this a day?
=
Ah! That Romeo ... lol
=
2:34 Do you think I'm just like Soyeon in the left poodle couple?
=
There's nothing like that but the rainy season looks like Simba .. !!
=
He's the newest out there. Why do you look more rookie?
=
It's another way that Thai looks so cool. Today I will study Thai.
=
God-so-yeon
=
Soyeon sister ... you like her
=
It is cool every day
=
Jeon So Yeon What is replaced ;;;;;;;;
=
Thumbnail Shu Hwa Sujin Where are you on?
=
What if I hadn't had a real cube It's a god of real gods.
=
Cube has a lot of jewels but my company can't pick the mulberry
=
Jeon So-yeon's genius title goes so well ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Why is this not in melon? ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow, it's really crazy Jeon So-yeon seems to be really crazy
=
Minni plays the magic in the intro, and Jeon So-yeon burns up this night in the rap part! The part that I do is memorizing the spells that make me power the magic that Minni walked.
=
Isn't it really crazy? Did you really go back? What? The children are sung singers and performers on stage. I think I can do something. It's really good. ;;;;;
=
Wow you rap over there? Is a real stage conspicuous and full.
=
This is the only performance you can do because you are Jeon So-yeon and children.
=
Jeon So-yeon sings, dances, writes songs, writes songs, and even writes a stage.
=
Ah Minni really ... My favorite was the rainy season, but I've only seen Minnie since uh oh ... Real Minnie is the best ... It's like an ancient Egyptian queen.
=
It's a lie in a group of kids here that's a gel rookie.
=
Minnie Real Treasure Tone Atmosphere
=
tie!?!?
=
How many groups can make this stage among debut year group? Like the power to focus on the stage and the addictive chorus! More exciting!
=
Real Soyeon started from arrangement, Soyeon was perfect to dance break, and it was good to be a leader, and Minnie Intro did a great job, and he was a good child as well. ❤ I'll support you ☺
=
What's even more surprising is that Jeon So-yeon was born in 1998 and is 22 years old.
=
Ratata Original feels like it came out first with this song in mind .. I completed the original song beyond the arrangement!
=
Take me to Minnie Esemal, please.
=
Min Ni Zi Thai crazy; Are you crazy when you wrap small sit-ups; Miyeonza Fighting Shuhwaja Ratata pronunciation Are you good? Sujinjak Whenever I see someone scared, I'm scared. Arrangement of small seats Are you finally crazy?
=
So Yeon is doing i love ya.
=
The group concept itself is not divided into sexy or innocent
It's compelling so you can try different challenges
=
Minni's mystery as if it's the king of the end plate ... I knew that Sujin had a strange feeling on the idol, but Minnie didn't see it ...
=
Minnie mood gets a little Egyptian princess? Queen? I feel so pretty, just a black princess.
=
Minnie Real Heavenly Slytherin Award .. I think I live quietly but if Minny comes up, even the Slytherin students die and make me crumple.
=
Miyeon is a neat and beautiful woman who seems to be only one in class, so it seems awkward for this fresh concept. The concept digestion is great, but Jeon So-yeon is going to produce the members very well.
=
Even though the Queen's stage is high quality overall, there's always a stage that feels like an overwhelming first place like Ratata or Destiny.
=
Where did you get that genius?
=
Wow, who's scared of this? So Yeon's creepy rage in the last part of this. So you're a real genius.
=
3:42 Sujin is scared of someone and looks like Jeon So Yeon.
=
No edit, you're a bit freaky. If you look at it, you come out of the reaction. It's a part of the killing part.
=
Jeon So Yeon is also Jeon So Yeon, but our children who made the ideas come true ... bb 걍 Teamwork Oji is like a team
=
If you come in to see this,
After seeing it, I want to see Minnie magic in front
Then I miss three times.
=
Jeon Soyeon's idea
=
It's amazing that the rainy season isn't Korean yet ... It's just Korean.
=
I'm going to be a kid
=
Jeon So-yeon's idea is to eat.
=
Minnie has been so attractive since I saw this stage ... Hairstyle, clothes and makeup were my sniper, but it was the first time that Thai heard this voice because she met Minnie's voice ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ You eat everything You're the best No one decorates the stage as well as you ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Go around all the stages and return to Ratata
=
I feel so good when I start Minnie. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Jeon So Yeon really knows how to use the members Minnie, I'm affectionate ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I don't know how many times I come to hear
=
Wow ... cube shouldn't bow to Jeon So-yeon
D
=
Cube is good to Jeon So-yeon
=
These pronunciations are all played separately, but when you sing, they're all so accurate Gap is so good
=
Composers who can't beat idols
=
Jeon So-yeon's great grandmother
=
I love you Sujin
=
I'm a genius, I like people who are so good
=
3:54 sec I think I've been obsessed with it ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Like Minnie's ranking
=
The first latata .. I started to go creepy
=
3:41
Who's scared?
=
Soyeon is so cool ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Even if I see it, I'm not tired
=
Sujin Johnye. Oh my god
=
What is the rainy season cute?
=
Wow ... Real Minnie Dipak! I don't like saying it quickly.
=
Jeon So Yeon rides Jonber until it hits
=
I'm frustrated watching Lovelyz Achu ...
=
Jeon So Yeon is also fascinating
=
Actually ... Really.
=
All is very beautiful
=
So-yeon is great to think about shaman.
It was creepy when Minnie did it.
I can't produce it, so I see it again ~
=
Minnie so ever ㅠ
=
Minni's Thai part is so cool that I'm alone and I'm tearing up in this part.
=
Hey guys, look no matter how many times
=
Wow ... Jeon So Yeon (Is your name ...?)
=
Minnie ... Oh my god.
=
Why not get tired?
=
That chew paper shaman was actually a rice bowl.
=
This is a girl crush ~ ♡♡
=
Children are getting bigger and bigger
=
If Jeon So-yeon is the original song, it's great ... He treats the song like a toy ... Genius
=
Wow, Minnie Thai is really haha
=
Miyeon and Shuhwa are still a bit awkward, but the song is so cute but the part of Shuhwa Latata Lata is so cute ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅌㅌ
=
Jeon So-yeon can be easily seen, but other members aren't kidding. Part distribution is appropriate, and it's digested like a cake.
=
All the kids are so pretty .. All the pictures are different, so it's fascinating.
=
Maybe the cute rainy season and the shoe are not one of the killing points because of the dreamlike atmosphere ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Miyeon's tone and eyes are perfect for an innocent group like April, but it's also a child's heart. But you can't do that next to Miyeon's head.
(Personal thinking)
=
The children are full of expressions, but Sujin and Soyeon are especially good at expressions. I love you so much.
=
Honestly, the introduction ripped off, it was a horror movie-like concept wicket
=
I thought it was fender stage.
=
3:45 At this point, Sujin is looking at who's scared and Soyeon's face shine but you don't have Sujin's face.
=
If you have a leader like So-yeon Jeon in your team,
=
The only thing that cubes are good at is picking artists ... Real artists are feeding cubes.
;) The girls are so cool
=
Jeon So-yeon, a true genius .. The perfect stage that even showed his ability to produce. I hope all the participating teams don't get hurt.
=
Maybe the winner of this war could be the newest children ...
=
Why isn't this version ??? ???
=
Soyeon's bleach short hair is so fast ... The first contest is for the first six kids ... ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
What's worse than Paab?
=
I think I'm so full of personality, charm ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, now I'm sorry to find out, but this version is so crazy .....
=
No Jeon So-yeon ... It's a real thing.
No matter where you are in the world, you will be pioneering your own path and succeeding.
I know the characteristics of the members like that and organize it in the arrangement by myself and plan not to die .. The idol class ability .. Really.
=
Jeon So Yeon is clearly a genius
=
Jeon So Yeon is really holding people
Feeling like a talented sorcerer
I guess ..... I've already thrown it away.
=
Minny first latata when I keep watching again and again creepy ....
=
Are you really a shaman?
That's how I feel when I follow other idols
3:43 3:53
=
Oh my girls in Queendom, AOA is really freaking out. I don't really know why children are sixth.
=
Even if you write a song, you hear the genius sound, but Jeon So-yeon ... Well ... the composition of the composition and the stage composition and the concept, the dance, the song, the rap are all good.
=
I'm a genius for children
=
It's so cute to be latata
=
Jeon So Yeon's Awesome ㅠㅠㅠ
=
01:23 Jeon So-yeon Every time I am highlighting this highlight, my face looks so crazy lol
=
I'm doing one video a day ...
=
0:38 Creepy tt
=
Real perfect from beginning to end
=
Miyeon is really pretty but the gesture is awkward ... ㅠ TT I watched the opening performance, but I thought it was too dry, but it seems like a Barbie doll is dancing ...
=
Jeon So-yeon is Jeon So-yeon, but other members have also helped to make Jeon So-yeon's wishes so well.
=
To be honest, I haven't seen anyone but once
=
This was really first place. Really, creepy.
=
0:01 Minni, I don't know how much I'm going to turn this around. I love you so much.
=
I'll be lying here today.
=
I listen to this when I sleep
=
It's really good to put the spell in front of it ...
=
Minnie This time I'm crazy and I think this concept is the best.
=
It's creepy like watching a real horror movie
=
I just ripped off the stage at Jeon So-yeon
=
Minnie, it's like a banquet.
=
Yellow hair Soyeon I think it's cool over 2 minutes.
=
Soyeon genius ...
=
No mnet work ;;? Soyeon, Romeo, why are you in Miyeon?
=
The game ends when Minnie memorizes the spell and whispers with Latata
=
Soyeon Minni Sujin stood out like this ... Sujin had no personal performance, but chew on her face TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT
=
I'm a rookie and I don't have a small number of members
=
Even though I only watched the intro
=
Is Thai so cool?
=
No queen so young genius
=
เรา เป็น คน ไทย นะ We are Thai.
=
If the contest is unconditionally strong and strong, I try to sing the song loudly, but can I arrange the arrangement naturally as the water flows in harmony?
=
Thai is so attractive
=
It's like different working horses ... If you give me your soul, I'll put him in hell.
=
Audio ,,, me ,,,,
=
Wow..
=
1 day 1 latata
=
To be sure, they're going to have a lot more than they lose in Queendom.
+ I like 2.6 thousand people? I was really surprised to see
=
I'm going to fuck my children ..... I'm crazy.
=
I changed my soul into the intro ... my soul sucked,
=
It's the first time that Thai is such a fascinating language.
=
At the end of the stage, on the air, the waiting room reaction came out, and the aoa group gathered in front of the TV lol.
=
The first part of Minnie was creepy as soon as I saw him.
=
I was really tired of arranging
I'm tired of Soyeon and Sujin
Minnie Boys got tired
I also had a performance
So So Yeon is amazing
=
Musical color is not universal, unlike other girl groups, it's unusual and attractive.
=
Wow, I really know this group, but I'm only out in Woogi. So Yeon?
=
What's worse is that every single member is visible. Other teams see only a certain person to see who's pushing in the company.
=
Is the arrangement and composition soyeon woven? It's amazing
=
Wow..!
Gel yearly lows in Queendom
Stage seems to be gel annual high
That's great girl ♡ How many times do you look back ~~
Arrangement is going crazy
=
I'm going to do some re-tangling, and I'm feeding this gooseberry ...
=
Jeon So Yeon is a natural hair style that is good at doing anything, even if you really study.
=
Soyeon's sister just started a company
=
Jeon So-yeon I just want to be chairman of the idol company
=
Let's win children! I want to see you sing all the stage in Mnet.
=
3:54 You are so cute
=
Nobody catches Minnie whispering coordinates 0:39
=
Shaman Concept Really new..Thai language was such an attractive language.
=
Cube is good to Soyeon sister ㄹㅇ .. The end of the year is waiting .... '0' ♡
=
It's allerby, isn't that part that Soyeon calls? Why Mi Yeon: Allerby
=
Showmi 8 Yunhui Jeon So Yeon is much better at rap
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius
=
I know they're number one, but I'm really impressed with the training. This is a contest. Jeon So-yeon.
=
Sujin's expression is really admirable
=
Really children remodeling
=
Minnie is really creepy.
=
Please do this stage at the awards ceremony. I'll be a regular shooter.
=
Beyond the degree
'legend
Struck me
=
No Jeon So-yeon, Idol is not enough .. Just a genius
=
0:38 I love you Latata
=
In the early I love ya, So-yeon calls me Mi-yeon,
=
0:41 Slutty ..... Passionate Shouting
=
I watch more than 10 times every day ... I'm crazy ... I'm only listening to the rata streaming.
=
Who's scared of what? Why's tears up? I'm turning 10th now
=
It's so cool ... What's your room like that since you've debuted more than 5 years? I can only admire you.
=
Shuhua doesn't have a chunke part ..? ㅠㅠ
=
Sujin, it's really cool.
=
Play at least 3 times a day ...
=
It feels like the noble queens
=
0:29 Minny
=
The original song is just exciting
It's like a potion
I'm excited, but I'm scared
=
Please hold a lot of Sujin please.
=
1 video per day
The end of the day is the ratata!
=
Please do this one more time ...
=
Lost in the mountains in the middle of the night, but slowly walking out of the cave as if they were obsessed with something ... That's the atmosphere ... Spreading the bloody aura ... Especially 0:56
=
I'll be back. Just use your crown. I'll get it all.
=
Cube must bow to So-yeon.
=
Something like an Ensuite in the Suside Squad!
=
Minnie, that witch from the witch.
=
Isn't it crazy?
=
Soyeon sister I was a fan since I was produced 101. At that time, I was also a ghost. I was really curious about the news after one day but it was just the debut news. I was happy, but I was worried about the concept or parts, but I thought it was different. I didn't worry about the song. good. ㅠㅠ
=
I'm another fan.
=
Intro Minny
=
By the way, did you have shoe shoes?
=
Jeon So Yeon is creepy to rap, and Minni is very charming when she is memorizing her order, and Su Jin is too dancing on the back.
It was charmingly beautiful and admired and the rainy season was low because of the low voice. Miyeon was clear and clean.
Minnie and Sujin felt elegant sexy that they could not feel in others.
I couldn't take my eyes off
=
I've never seen anything other than idol dreamcatchers and children acting on this concept.
=
Whether or not you win here, it's a good opportunity for the kids! Because I'm a rookie, I still have less chance to show the stage, but I can come out and show a lot !! Fight our girls !! (❁ '▽' ❁)
=
I'll be falling into a girl idol. I'm really into a group called children.
=
Concept song arrangements are all unique
I have lived for at least 20 years and have never seen this color in a girl group
Children are just another class
=
It's a waste to say that So-yeon is a genius.
If it was a south stone, I would have put the article on the air all the time.
=
Sincerely, the concept of girls fits so well. The Egyptian concept wasn't a joke at the awards stage.
=
Oh, I'm so crazy. I feel like this for a long time. It's been a long time.
=
Wow, it's so crazy that it's so crazy that it pops out of my mouth.
=
Real Jeon So-yeon knows how to raise each member's ability to the maximum.
=
Last time you ordered something like this
=
Genius, genius Soyeon is a genius. How did you really think about arranging this? Real cubes refuse to have Soyeon.
=
Let's win children today
=
Minnie looks like a real black viper.
=
I think it's the only one I've been good at in PewDue. Just like Pew's YG and JYP.
=
Minnie bangs are really hot. There's a gap between the stage and reality, so there's a reason for being a real number one.
=
If the children keep on pounding like this
=
Lee Gyeong-yeon is a scam. Idle has a genius producer, So-yeon.
=
Arrangement was really good at the start of the latata and creepy when I was ...
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real celebrity
=
It's cute like a rainy season baby lion ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Who's so scared? Part is so good.
=
I'm so crazy ... Dazo and ...
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real prime CL looking feel real treasure
=
Wow ~ The arrangement was really good. It's going to be a record.
=
Ah Minni is so good ...
=
Come on, please
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius
=
I'm so cool Minnie on this stage ,,, is the introduction jackpot real ,,,
=
Jeon So-yeon's facial acting is really crazy
=
Jeon So-yeon is the best ... you are the best ... so cool and charismatic
=
I didn't write much in the comments, but there's also Cody and Carrie.
=
3:41 This gel is creepy 3:42
=
3:30 ♥ ️ ♥ ️ ♥ ️ ♥ ️ ♥ ️ ♥ ️
Who's scared !!!!!!!!!
=
From the introduction 걍 No. 1 children ㅆㅂ It's really creepy
=
Jeon So Yeon is really creepy How can people come back like this creepy, horrible song when they come back next time?
=
I always feel every time I listen to children's songs.
=
Overworked
The kids are so popular and the songs are good.
=
I don't think it's going to shut up if you watch the intro ... Everyone who sees the movie Mummy will understand me.
=
Honestly early scary ;;
=
I told you this, but the members really met Jeon So-yeon
=
It's really amazing
=
If you really have a wish, you've done color lenses or dark makeup to the members who have a cute face on your face at least once ... !!! It's not like you're looking at me right now. I feel like I'm feeling like this ... The concept is always strong.
=
And Minnie ?? That's too fatal for me, please have me.
=
Usually the rapper feels deeper but the rapper is the main one
I'm full of talent
=
Even if I see it, I'm not tired
=
First minnie creepy .. ;;;
=
I'm back
=
Their powerful atmosphere scares me Neverland can hit 10 million for our pretty queen. Their introduction is omggggg
=
You have to watch the first part of it
=
good
=
Cube is good at recruiting talent.
=
I felt it when they finished their contracts, and if they had established subsidiaries and continued their work, Jeon So-yeon wrote the concept itself, not the costume song part, but worked better than the cube.
=
3:41 Sujin, who's really scared when he's scared.
=
I feel that I'm a real agency because I'm a queen. I feel that I can't even produce on stage or music. I feel so cool and give off all the talents and competencies. Popularity But the public likes this stage.
=
I'm curious if I can see the unique look of each member in one stage
=
The arrangement was good
Particularly, his song is not easy to arrange because he sang it.
Because I know everything about the song, it's hard to be locked in that frame
So Yeon-yi, who is also a producer, has a special ability for children, so she seems to digest it.
=
왘 Really early part is really ant tt ㅠ ㅠ TT TT TT girl is crushed ㅠㅠ TT TT TT TT so tt TT TT TT TT so cool real pret Not coming
=
Jeon So-yeon's like a slam dunk chae-chi-chim. I'm frustrated by hitting the wall every time, no matter how good I am, I meet my teammates and do what I dreamed of.
=
* There are people who haven't seen anyone, *
=
I felt from the time of Unpretty, but Jeon So Yeon is really a thing.
=
Stop showing real trainees
=
Wow .... ㅁㅊ .... Arrangement is amazing.
=
Jeon So-yeon is going to get a lot from this Queendom
=
It's really intense like watching a horror movie. Gamover in the intro! I've been searching for a single song.
=
Really… … … Minni Thai was really creepy
=
Isn't this the musical introduction? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ So awesome ,,,,,,
=
The most successful soloist from Pewdu is Cheng-ha, the group of children
=
Even though I got 4 episodes, but it's like Ratata's first time ... Feeling of doing it
=
A group of real geniuses from all walks of life, creeping all the time.
=
I've never seen anyone but I've never seen him before.
=
If you put parentheses in the hash tag, you can't tag it.
.
Anyone noticed that g-idle is the only group that isn't hashtagged in the queendom clips? Mnet if you see this please edit the hashtags. HASHTAGS DO NOT SUPPORT BRACKETS !! Please remove all the brackets and go as #gidle and #girls
=
Children are the group that they expect every time they really come back. The concept isn't always banal, but new. I'm very excited about each and every one of them. I think I'll fall in love with you. I love you.
=
Soyeon sister ㄹㅇ Looks like unbelief Wow .. The outfit coordinating makeup fits nicely but Soyeon sister is really coming ㅠ Sujin sister was like a vampire
=
Kim Minni clearing paper ... I am so scared that I am a bit scared
=
I thought I'm good at children's debut, but I'm good .. There are pretty idols, but there are certainly many artistic idols in Korea.
=
No, please release this sound. Please ㅠㅠㅜ TTTTTTTTTTTTTT
=
2:10 I think it's my turn now
=
Reason for becoming a fan of fans: Jeon So-yeon --- Genius
=
Jeon So Yeon throws anything away and makes everything attractive.
=
I was horrified at the beginning and the ratata.
=
3:42 Crazy ... Sujinji
=
I like it so much wow ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow ... Soyeon, my niece is so cool.
=
It's my first time to mention Minnie Intro.
=
It's funny how the audiences are squeaky ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
ㅇㅋ Jeon So Yeon from today
=
0:38 Continue to listen
=
Please give me the arrangement version.
=
Minni black hair and ambience .. I couldn't imagine the atmosphere of black magic.
=
Introduction Office
=
So-yeon, let's collect our money
=
Before the final chorus, Sujin was so overwhelmed by the look of who she was, so she came to see me all the time.
=
Jeon So Yeon, I've been remodeling since ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Oh, I'm Oh My Girl, but I'm a pair of girls.
=
I ... I think it's a bit of a sujin ... Your sister is over.
=
The stage transition seems so amazing, I'm going crazy
=
I missed you so much. I love you.
=
Jeon So-yeon Best
=
3:11 1 second Ryu Junyeol
=
So Yeon-yi is so genius that I can't see it at night.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius
=
Actually, I didn't know the group of G kids, but honestly, the stage is the best.
=
Wow, the stage is really good.
=
Some members' facial expressions are a bit unfortunate ㅠㅠ
=
I hope you will stage like this in big stages such as Mama or Song Daejeon.
=
Jeon So-yeon and children are worth it ..... So-yeon Genius
=
Director
=
If you arrange a dance break, it's common
So fresh .. ㅠ ~~~ ㅠ
=
I hope our team has someone who will carry you like Jeon So-yeon.
=
Jeon So Yeon is really good
=
Minnie is really sweet at first
=
Hing to die here
=
Oh Minny was Thai
=
All-combustion; Girinet;
=
Oh it's really creepy and it's creepy ... I don't see Queendom.
=
Mamamu wore the first place What? How good are you? I've been doing it well. I did well. I've won enough. I'm convinced.
=
Please put a lot of Sujin dance ㅠㅠㅠ
Idol dance queen genealogy first place ㅠㅠㅠ
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
See you again
=
The rainy season is definitely a cute face to stand in this concept.
=
It's like the shaman version
=
I'm crazy if I see you again.
=
Introductory spelling in Thai seems to be a real god
Something that is mysterious and dreamy survives really well
I'm so excited about the future
=
First of all, the children are all different, and their ability to play is different.
=
Jeon So-yeon's amazing skills followed by the amazing members of the children ...
=
I really liked my children since their debut. I hope they'll take the opportunity to become a shoe doll.

L Legend stage is not the best I've ever seen ;;
The main thing is Soyeon Carry ^^
Please introduce yourself ~~
=
Jeon So-yeon seems to know what each member really is and how to make a great and stage. It is wonderful to express the ratata in black magic, but it is really a bit strange to use the dreamy Minnie in the intro ...
=
Cubes Jeon So Yeon a hundred times
=
What's the introduction ...? And how many times are you going to turn around? It's a genius, it's a talent, it's creepy
=
M: I'm gonna fall in love with my children
=
Jeon So-yeon ㅠ Really crazy Idol steamed So-yeon
=
Crazy .... This is crazy.
=
Why is that dance so good after 3:45?
=
2:16 What about Siren when leisure Soyeon reaches out? Mermaid? It seemed that everyone was tempted to make it into the water. Lyrics also approached Bebe, deeper into the sea (in the sea) can be drunk with me ... And at the end, Idol sing along with the other like the other idols, and it was creepy because it seemed to memorize the spell with real black magic.
=
Intro is a real generation.
=
I think I'm ordering Latata ...
=
Wow, it's a legend. It's a legend.
=
Creepy at last
=
I knew only the rainy season's face, but I'm not interested in it.
ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ white and dongle ,,,, feel like a rabbit between sisters ,,,,,, but the voice is low and ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ cute look ㄹㅇ
=
Fans trying to cheer for the arranged song are so funny ,,,
=
Jeon So-yeon is crazy
=
Jeon So-yeon Musician Life Minimum 9999999999999999999999
=
I think I'm a bit of a mouth ... How can I do Neverland ㅠ _ ㅠ
=
Minni มิ น นี่ สาว ไทย ไม่ แพ้ ชาติ ใด ใน โลก
=
No, shouldn't this be done on stage?
=
Is it really fascinating? Minnipart is crazy.
=
It's a girl rapmon ...
To rap parts to compose to song to dance
In addition, you are the center
Awesome
=
I thought Sujin was really fascinating, but Minnie looks so good.
=
Jeon So-yeon
=
The kids' concept is really unique
=
Jeon So Yeon Please ... Please dress me up.
=
I love you awesome
=
헉 태국 헉 태국 태국 태국 태국 태국 태국 ^ ^ ^ ^^^ ㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ (?
=
This team gets bigger and lasts longer
=
Big cool
=
Weak pop is pretty late
=
Something like the princesses of Oggle in Sugar Sugar .....
=
The other team did well, but the girls (children) were so impressed with the first edition. Sincerely, Min Min.
=
Soyeon's real expression and the strength and weakness of singing when she sings Eva ...
=
So Yeon is good and attractive.
I was sorry to see you blaming your face ugly at the time of production.
=
Honestly, cube singers don't need composers ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I found out that Jeon So-yeon is a real genius. I couldn't doubt it at all.
=
Jeon So-yeon's facial acting or gesture is almost 5-6 years old. ;;; Arrangement is ridiculous
=
John was immersed in the front part because Minni seemed to be cursing me, but after I saw it, I was in love;
=
Oh, I'm really crazy, Minnie first appeared scene Musical Dracula and stage composition 걍 Crazy Don't give me a breathing space?
=
Oh, the real shaman version. It's so awesome. Real Oh. I think he's juggling me to love me.
=
Minnie whispered and creepy from head to toe
=
Wow .... I wasn't a real joke.
Really irreplaceable concept Who can't follow the tower Idol ㅠㅠㅠ One by one, why is this jewelry so I watched the Queendom I'm really a fan more ㅠㅠ I love it so much ㅏㅏ The power that the new actress gave me ... can not be human ... Perfect .. I'm hit by Seosujin's eyes and dance line and the uniformity of Shuhwa 괔 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Miyeon's Charisma and Minnie charm
♥ ️ ♥ ️
=
Jeon So-yeon, who composed and composed all of them, is a real genius.
=
In a previous stage video, someone said that it would be nice for children to keep pushing with the concept of black magic.
=
All the other members are so good and Jeon So Yeon is really all-purpose ..... What can't you do?
=
It's really creepy to memorize the order in Thai at first ...
=
Minnie's voice and feeling are very unique
I think it was an intro that saved it
It's a real genius
Cube is fed by Jeon So-yeon.
=
Soyeon eats with my eyes
=
And on this stage, Minnie was just a witch itself.
=
3:41 Wow, it's really creepy, what's going on here? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋ Lata original song is also how to develop more ,,,, Jeon Soyeon is crazy ,,,,,,,
=
Jeon So Yeon's doing well I just don't get tired of seeing and seeing you again.
=
You have to bow down to Cube Soyeon.
=
Jeon So Yeon was born to be an idol
=
Jeon So-yeon Just set up a company.
=
Intro witchcraft killing point, Jeon So-yeon rap, and "What is scared" at the Sujin part creepy 쫙 ... I'm good at this time ㅎㅎ
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius.
=
In the introduction, Minni simmered like a spell in her native language.
=
Wow ... So Yeon Real Dog Genius Nuclear Sexy
=
The stage that can only be called genius
=
Jeon So-yeon Charismatic Crazy Blonde seems to maximize
=
มิ น นี่ Minnie ♥ ️
=
Once upon a time I saw the stage of the ratata Minnie looks so different. Take a look!
=
Soyeon, it's difficult, I envy you When I do it, I feel like I've touched it with a machine.
=
0:40 Why are you holding that and yelling?
=
I love girls
=
Arrangement is really coming ...
=
Seriously creepy when first latata and black and white ... Thai charm
=
Minni ..
=
Sujin, I love you .. ㅠㅠ
=
1:26 A handsome celebrity;
=
I stopped breathing and it was creepy enough to see.
=
I'm sure it went over to Minnie's order. How many times a day do you see?
=
1 video per day
=
Jackpot
nice
=
Sujin's baby keeps getting stuck in a single shot
=
Where are the men who are caught in the middle? Something like that often catch ;;;;;
=
It's a magical intro, so I don't think it's too hard to sing a rapatta song.
=
Lovelyz beats up than Achu stage
=
I'm going to be sacrificed at the witch's party.
=
See you again
=
Soyeon: Girl Crush Main Wrapper & Producer.
The symbolic presence of the team that does not need a horse + the main wrapper, but also complies with singing. Composer Composer Arrangement Stage production is a multi-purpose cavalry.
Miyeon: The main vocal of the young lady.
The song is not completed until the screaming vocals are mixed with Savi and Bridge. If there is no vanity. + Up to visual.
Minnie: Dreamy and mysterious visuals.
The atmosphere and aura are the most unique among the members. The owner of an interstellar charm that seems to be sucked into a bird you don't know if you see it.
Sujin: Sexy + Concentrate Ratio Main Dancer.
Dance line is the most flexible of six people. It's a typical cat-like visual, but it's not just a normal cat, but an inexhaustible sexy femme fatale manle cat.
Rainy season: Great anti-war thug on Cutieface.
Cuteness charge. It's a cute face, but the super-inverted boyish tone plays the role of salt in children's songs.
Shu Hwa: Unique innocence that 5 out of 6 don't have. Natural visual with clean and neat feeling without one dust.
Each of the six members is different and unique, and each of the six members has a different charm. The girl crush, sexy, dream, cuteness, delicacy, innocence, etc., each character is so obvious, and the synergy is very good when they are united with each other.
=
This is why you need a composition member who knows how to save your team's color. Jeon So-yeon
=
And Thai are combined like this? Cheonjan ...
=
Minni's introduction
=
Jeon So Yeon is a genius to be creepy.
=
Well done over the stage. Jeon So-yeon's Minshee smashed the stage (Intro and Soyeon Rappart creepy level) and Sujin chews her eyes as usual. It's a bit unfortunate that this stage should be unique to the eye, but Miyeon is a little gentle. Seems good. Ugi and Shu are cute. This stage would have been more charismatic than cute
=
If you look at Soyeon, I'm proud of you. I'm happy every time I see you. Soyeon ~
=
Wow, it's more than real expectations
=
I think it would be nice to do this later at the year-end awards. Originally, the original singer was a legend of the era, and it was such a good cover ㅡ ㅡ There is no one in the girl group to cover as much as these guys
=
I'm thrilled when Jeon So-yeon always smiles by the side as he takes out parts and pulls out his secretary's card when he sets up Seo Su-jin as the center,
=
Jeon So-yeon is not a rookie, but a steamed veteran feeling. What kind of life have you lived in that short time? Is the gene so good?
=
But the tension goes up when I come out Jeon Soyeon ㅋㅋㅋ lol
=
It's just like the jungle, the dance breaks while I'm dancing. Sujin is alone. I really feel like a snake that lives in the jungle.
=
If Jeon So-yeon became a PewDoo Io I would have been wearing a tennis skirt and dreaming.
=
쟤 What's Sujin like so attractive?
Strangely so sexy and eyes What did you put a black hole in the eyeballs? Why am I being sucked ...
=
Honestly, except for Park Bom, there were only two children out of five teams to cover 2 Anyone properly ;;;
So Yeon confidently proposed to change the cover song with Park Bom because Mi-yeon from Weiji was confident
=
Mi-yeon seems to have something left over. I lived as a waji trainee, and I was a senior member of the same company that I saw very much, and I thought I would have been in Wolpyeong. Although I made my debut at another agency, Mi-yeon often gets noticed when I know Mi-yeon was a trainee.
=
Really funny
1 Ratata 2 Ra Fire Final Ryan over 10 million
It's 3
2 d 6 th 3 d 4 th Slightly nonsense
=
I didn't know it before, but now I see Soyeon opened. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Say Ryan Don't Like Ratata Fire
It's just a sprouting chew legend
=
Whatever the result, the kids who proved by views
=
3:53 I'm coming again to see Sujin.
Ji Het
=
It's like a good arrangement, especially the back beat. Jeon So-yeon Best
=
No, honestly, I only see children.
=
The reason why the kids stand out
The performance was a strong team compared to other teams.
=
Honestly, if you squeeze your tongue like that of Sujin, it's squirming.
=
Does this make sense? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'm the # 1 video in the whole of the Queendom video !! Really all the stage was good enough to be intact ;; ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
After the Queendom, I really enjoyed arranging the original song. If it was arranged like a completely different song, it would have been frightening that the original song was damaged. The children's songs flew around and I arranged them on different stages. Ability recognized
=
Why are all the broadcasts these days manipulating ;; Let's admit it; What is the use of the operation stage prepared hard? Look at the views. It's not a million but over 10 million
=
When you cover a legend group, you have to do this.
Which group do you like?
Really good children.
=
Even after the Queendom, I keep seeing arrogant children. Of course, the other groups did well, too.
=
I see Sujin's real life. It's a heavenly idol.
=
It's a real genius to come up with this jungle concept.
=
I'm not convinced that this is sixth place.
If you do it twice, you can't erase the suspicion that you've tampered with the falling team.
Oh My Girl's ranking is a recognized chew.
It doesn't really make sense that Lovelyz is fourth and they're six.
=
I think this is a stage so good that it tastes better than the original song.
=
This stage seems to have discouraged children's personality and arrangement to show courtesy and respect to 2ne1.
=
Look at the shout. Really lol I don't understand why it was the last.
=
I didn't watch the Queendom, but I can't believe it's sixth ...
=
Listening to the Giants, listening to kda, Jeon So-yeon, Legend, Boy, Unpretty Rapstar Boy, Pewdu Boy, Ratata Boy, Boa, Ryan
=
There are so many things I memorized all the other actors' reactions.
=
Recommends that I came in. I was over 30 years old. So 10 years ago, I was Soshi One Girl 2 Anyone. Nowadays, children?
=
Why can't anybody talk about Shuhwa Chalanglang?
Replying to @DavidGill
=
Jeon So-yeon ability could arrange more, but I wanted to feel the fragrance of seniors whom I admired on purpose.
=
Some people say that the children are too indigestible because 2NE1 is so great. You are very good.
=
I'll be born with Seosujin tongue in my next life
=
Look at the stage, rankings already meaningless to the kids.
=
I'm the only child version I'm crazy ???? ㅠ ㅠㅜㅠㅠ Only this version keeps coming back
=
Honestly, I still don't believe this ranking .. OMG Girls I think the children were the biggest hit.
=
Dogs are good facts. But it may feel a bit unfortunate for my age generation when the original song came too intense. I'm so used to the original song that it doesn't live like the taste we know.
=
This is Minnie's makeup and costume.
The rainy hair is cute and I don't understand it's sixth
=
If you drop children, there's no reason to see Queendom.
=
Um ... I don't know if they look at the number of hits, but they're sixth place.
=
Even if it wasn't WY policy, I'm listening to it ....
=
I was so charming
=
This small stage made the 6th place, so Jeon So-yeon's poisonous gear was well received.
=
I think it's easy to destroy a large fire truck ??? !!!! .....
=
3:56 I knew it was crazy. That's what it really means to eat the stage; I felt like I faced a lion.
=
Children are like idols who find their color best whatever they do
=
If you're really like Kingdom, you kill me ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅜㅜㅠㅠ Queen Kingdom 2 ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Really please
=
Isn't it pretty if the rainy days make up and put on your hair?
=
Wow ~ look at Jeon So Yeon. Really best
=
The firepower is too weak for the children to fire.
=
Honestly, it wasn't the last stage.
=
Seunghee's reaction is so good ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'm sure it's not sixth since the Mnet series.
=
3:59 No hyejung cute❤️
=
This is the last time
=
Something was empty, but it's Park Bom Part ... Park Bom's voice is so unusual and powerful, but Mi Yeon's voice is pretty but thin and weak.
=
How many times do I see this?
=
They were ok. But 2NE1 is a legend.
=
The view count is higher than any video 앜 ㅋㄹㅋㄹ ㅋㄹㅋ
=
I can see why the camera is catching so much
=
Really good. Children's colors, but 2 Anyone generation knows, but 2 Anyone Fire is really.
=
Like the children sacrificed to stop the last Lovelyz ㅠㅠ
=
I knew this time. The shoe will grow a lot in the next album
=
See the difference in views
The public's choice is children ;;;
=
Whatever the result, it's good enough for the children to be active here and to raise awareness. Mnet, you don't know anyone.
=
Boy or Mnet views more than your subscribers .... black or black I'm watching this 86th time ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Jeon So Yeon is a real fan.
=
I watch it 10 times a day and I'm really steamed by my children.
=
I don't know how many times a day I'm coming
=
Automatically generate Korean subtitles ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
I'm going crazy
=
So, you're holding a yellow mic fan as a gift!
=
4:01 Ah, I'm so funny .. hahahaha
=
I can't understand how they are.
=
Emergence of a new royal color ☆ Seosujin ☆
=
So Yeon sister when I first appeared, why is this confident step so good ... ㅠㅠㅠ
=
So-yeon is a real person. I was crazy. I can't take my eyes off you. He's stuck in the ear and he's in control of the stage. Pretty and cute.
=
Jungle Concept was so good.
=
* They doing this show .. *
CAMERA PIDDY REAULLY THANK YOU ㅠㅠ ❤❤
=
What's wrong with this stage? It doesn't make sense to me ....
=
Children always excel in selection .... I'm the best, but other songs are good, but there's nothing like Fire to show a new face and energy ... The proper arrangement to the perfect part of the trip feel the memories. Give cubes to Jeon So-yeon for a bigger studio. Seriously. And children are usually quiet, but it's hard to fly on stage.
=
I'm so good at this stage. Why are you 6th?
=
Amnet's masterpiece ... this sixth place on the stage makes no sense
=
It's only natural that 2ne1 is better at comparing it to 2ne1
No group is better than 2ne1 unless it covers the famous fire, 2ne1.
It's amazing what kids digested that much.
=
Su..Sujin ... ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Tiger just show me once more ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Minni, why are you so shy? Minnie styling. What are you doing? You're so crazy. I'm so insane ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ... I love you ........
+ Crazy is not unusable.
=
I don't know how many times I look back
=
Honestly, 6th place is Aimim ;; I'll give it to you
=
Genuine Minnie Tone Crazy with San ...
=
Why don't we get tired of seeing children's stage
=
Jeon Soyeon ㅋㅋㅋ Really, I'm doing a live show in the middle of the microphone ㅋㅋㅋ What's really cool ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This is not a jewelry of our country but a world jewel.
=
I got a voice from my sister-in-law.
And Sujin's sexy dance solo after group choreography ?? I've been Neverland since I started.
=
Minnie is so stylish ㅠㅠㅠ Really like real children ㅠㅠㅠ
=
When I first started, it's a tuni one swarm.
=
Whoever sees this performance won't get 3 votes down ㅋㅋ; I hope you don't have to worry about this because your views are telling you how great you are.
=
But I think the kids are very good at Queendom
I only knew Jeon So-yeon from my children
I knew it before, but it blossomed like a queen
=
Best suited to Mi-yeon in the Queendom stage.
Slightly exponential and fits well into the song
=
It's too bad that it didn't come out as a sound source
=
I'm listening to 2NE1 songs on the stage these days.
=
So Yeon is really good ...
=
Oh, every time I see you, I'll die cute ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The more you look at it, the more you write. What is Mnet doing? Why did you make the dropout system? At first glance, it is first place in first year rookie. If you didn't feel 2NE1 this time, stop
Is that it? I don't understand it. If other teams fire, they can't even half their children.
=
3:04 What are you doing?
=
The children were really happy with the tone.
=
Soyeon is going to be the best girl group ever.
=
The only thing missing from the Queen was that the number of fandoms was small compared to other groups.
The actual queen of queen is you !! Wonderful queens like lions ♥ ️
=
Where did you see Soyeon every stage  I feel like this ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ What was it? I understand when I write and I smile with confidence in the succession part of Sujin. We have Sujin!
=
Let's be honest ... hits don't lie..really ..
=
I don't know why it's the sixth place.
=
It's a pity compared to the original song, but it was because it was over 2A1, but it wasn't because of the lack of children's skills or the 6th stage. I don't want children to die because of this.
=
I'd like to imitate the lyrics at 4:29, but I'm really crazy and shake it.
=
Although the original songs were overwhelming, I personally did a really good job, arranging them in the spring jungle concept.
=
1:59 Father ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
* Why this is so *
=
I'm not a fan of girls but I'm a fan of my girl, but honestly I've heard oh my girl's destinies and girls' fires are the same number of times. Better than the real sixth sense ...
=
The rainy season is cute.
=
I keep seeing you.
=
3:56 I can't admit Seo Su Jin. I've already run Queendom.
=
Su-jin and So-yeon Chemie really did ... So Yeon
=
Jeon So-yeon Carry Hane 2ne1 songs are so strong that the members don't feel like the original song.
=
3:01 Jeon So-yeon, something awesome when you rhythm ..
=
Even if I see 6th place, I understand it. You should have given at least third place.
=
What do you like about these sisters? ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Yes, my hair is fluttering and my hips are flirty
Shake, run, shout, be free, just do it, do whatever you want ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
But really good before ;; Part distribution, stage composition, and nothing missing, Jeon So-yeon is the same as the original song, but 2NE1 is so unique, but other members are a little disappointing.
=
No, I'm really good at it, but my performance is so crazy ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Wow, it's really short when you're in Seomujin, but you beat the beat in that tempo section
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ It's amazing that it's all right.
=
Sujin is really good at lip-syncing with fishery .. Shoe is too good .. Miyeon's vocals are really heard .. Not to mention Minni .. Soyeon is really awesome .. Cute and ... Ah, this is the place to lie ... Happy
=
3:55 Seo Su-jin ...
=
Minnie's crazy makeup costumes.
=
Jeon So-yeon ... The presence is crazy
=
After all I like girls' songs ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
So Yeon is a real genius. I'm sure I saw this stage. Lol 2NE1
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ You can see this compared to Lovelysense.
=
Does it make sense for the sixth place?
The more I look at you, I get angry
=
2:21 Sister who is cute to see ..... TT
=
Call the judges if you're going to do some voting;
Then why do you ask to vote?
=
How is this 6th place? Mnet crazy.
=
Everyone knows how much music they have ... why the public chose the last ones to feel which team didn't ...
=
I don't understand that it's treated like Lovelyz Six Sense ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I've heard that it's a pity if I choose two songs.
=
What's wrong with 15 million views?
=
Soyeon is the best .. !!!
=
4:14 I'm so cute with Shu Hwa
=
I really liked the children ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ It was just a level I like lightly but I'm looking at the Queendom ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅠㅠ
=
2:05 Where did you see that?
=
6th place, but highest harmony among all Queendom videos
=
Manipulation Mnet manipulated again in Queendom.
=
I don't know when I saw this, but there are rumors that I was misted at the stage.
=
I'll be your sisters now
=
4:01 Ah ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ General Hyejeong ~~~ Is it cute?
=
Anytime ㄹ ㅇ booming
=
But there was only one team to cover Park Bom Tak.
=
Lovelyz wants to see Fire cover ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's like a stage that is well expressed in children's colors. It's better than the original song.
=
There should be such a clip ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
1:52 sec Yeshua's smile
=
Jeon So-yeon's character.
=
Let's start again. Real sound. I can't go tomorrow.
=
Really crazy ㅆ ㅆ ㅡ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ This is a two children version of the sound source urgently, Sujin Queen when you are the best
=
0:28 I think it came from sixth sense? How do you feel?
=
The youngest in Queendom ... Why are the children in sixth place ... Really.
Even if I'm neverland
Oh my girl knows to be number one.
At first look, Lovelyz is 6th place .. I don't want to get off.
Really ... but I did everything except Lovelyz .....
=
4:03 Helm
=
4:11 Shuhua part keeps coming back to listen ㅠ
=
Even if the score is the same
=
1:13 Sujin !!!!!!
=
I like it more than 2NE1.
=
ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ You've been renewed.
=
Soyeon, it's like a genius
=
Respecting the opinions of the leaders, the members' personality is well maintained, and each one is unique and memorable. The girl group is considered to be a real hand. The real future is too anticipated
=
I don't know why this stage is sixth
=
Sujin also has two legs because of the rainy season.
=
00:32 Is it a feeling of praise? Is this just me funny? LOL Q. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No. Cube foreigners sing Korean songs and become Korean genius ;; Pronunciation
=
0:56 0:59 Cute
=
0:35 Minnie has been laughing since,
=
Shuhua ...
=
Sujin Iran is a heavenly celebrity
=
Do the real cubes to So Yeon as well.
=
I'm usually not interested in idols, but it's also a good idea to listen to the songs that you play in class.
Soyeon's first time seeing a girl
=
I like this group lol
=
This is sixth place.
=
Soyeon is really looking forward to seeing you.
=
4:03 Sujin Sister ♡
=
So-yeon Dog Carrier
=
3:58 I come to see Hyojeong Goon Hall every day.
=
Why is it so good to get my face off at 1:47?
=
Lovelyz What did they give the children one vote below ㅋㅋ Do you think they really did better than you ... The stage response itself is so dramatic
=
03:55 Good
=
It's sixth place ... I think it's true that it's a true scapegoat.
=
I still do not understand that this is sixth ...
=
4:04 Sujin ...
=
0:54 Wial Children> <
=
No. 2:40 When I come out Sujin, I'm really screaming.
=
Love love love my baby
=
Miyeon is so cool to sing ... ㅠㅠ Very good to hear
=
How do you mean this is sixth place? Of course, the original songs were overwhelming, but it was really crazy that they were nostalgic and reinterpreted as children. Lovelyz and the tone weren't right
=
Let's do some smoke ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I can't see it.
=
6th place is a joke
=
Jeon So-yeon is cool .. Children are crazy .. Children are in a crisis.
=
I saw and felt sixth place.
Cj has to make dumplings, not broadcast.
All you have to do is play it.
=
With this video, we have one Neverland .... ㅎㄷㄷ
=
I don't need to talk like every single person
=
There is no amount of shoes
=
No matter how much, the children came to see the real broadcast as if they were a real scapegoat. I didn't say it. Amnet goes beyond my imagination.
=
Jeon So-yeon's faithfulness is so real
=
No matter how you look at it, it's better than Lovely Six Sense!
=
The fire should be listened to as it was, and the children were really good at this song.
Can't hide the color of the kite
=
0:54 we are i-dle
2:10 Ugiyang Branch
3:42 look! Awawawa
3:55 Sujin sister TT
4:12 Shuhwa Sallanghaang
=
I love you so much and I'm wrapped in my sister Sujin
=
Lovelyz I'm going to give you the table below.
=
Mi-yeon is not always unique, but always in her place
I think I'm doing my best.
=
I don't understand why this is sixth
I did so well
=
So is this sixth place?
=
3:55 Come in every time you see a thumbnail to see this expression
=
Last time, there was a man who coed swearing about the rainy season's hair, but I was shocked that I didn't know Sandara's hair.
=
I came to see you again after 4:47.
=
Youtube Lesha Only the children's videos in all contests video views overwhelmingly higher scores and rankings .... ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Soyeon: Sujin !!!
=
This is good, but sacrificed for low annuality ;; It's a cover song. What's a cover song? I did a good job ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It was a treasure of children and children. I only knew the two kids who called kda, and all the other members were crazy.
=
You're really good at it.
=
I guess it was a lot of burden while singing a famous song.
=
I'm listening to this song as it's been 4.8 billion times, can't you put it on the music site? ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Please ㅠㅠ
=
Anyway, Jeon So-yeon's Jung Hye Jeon Jeon Jeon Jeol Jeol ㅋㅋㅋ ㄱㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ 6th place, but nobody thinks it's the 6th place.
=
Fog from that stage? Firecracker? Minnie doesn't look right because of the white smoke. Oh, it's really annoying.
=
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
=
I want to record it and show it to Dara.
=
Wow no, why the hell are you 6? I'm all so good. You're so good. Really, people are all over the world. What I've been doing. I've been dying. I'm good, my dog ​​tears up
=
It's really tearing up. I actually watched it.
=
Miyeon is really pretty ..
=
Sujin Wow
=
Why is this 6
=
I really want to see you again.
=
Come and see the 48
I know you are good at it
More creepy
=
Jeon Soon Dog Chews Hull
=
It is the second CL. So Yeon has a reason for being a children leader.
=
Jeon So-yeon was not the character to be evaluated at Pewdue ...
=
ㅡ ㅡ ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I put this 6th place in front of the original song lol
=
The children were so good but they couldn't win the original song.
=
Ah So Yeon Lee wrapped her in tears and shed tears
=
Dance brakes are so addicted
=
I watched this stage and I was passionate about Nepland Indie.
=
No, not really again 03:37 The children ripped off; Superb arrangement
=
Relight is urgent
=
No, I've pulled out the jungle concept from this song 걍 Crazy genius TT TT Just Jeon So Yeon So cool 윽 Dan seo sujin 진 Jugeum ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The stage is also really awesome, but the reaction in the middle is really funny ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Sister's cute reaction and Hyejeong's tongue are the key points ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Minnie, why are you so cute? I love you
=
Fire was really good, but if I had been the best, Seo Sujin would chew on the stage. Especially, she danced with her hair. She had a good match with Suhwa and Sujin.
=
I've been on the dolmen board without looking at the Queendom, and I know that every single girl's stage was the most talked about. I've got it
=
Ha, if I'm Park Bom, I feel like I'm watching a babysitting song
=
The members are really harmonious ... All of them are very different ... They are the same scat, So-yeon Sujin is completely different, and the same innocence, Mi-yeon Shuhwa is too different. The color is really dark, so I think Jeon Soyeon is really good at producing
=
It was 1411 million yesterday and today's 1416 .... (as of November 11, 2019)
=
3:04 True story
=
Doesn't it make sense for girls to lose six senses?
=
Really
=
But the performance is performance, but the stage lighting and the camera composition are crazy
The music center is one of the choreographies, and it is seen here, and each one is unique.
=
Let's play children's new song quickly
=
I'm another fan, but I look like a cat that looks classy and pretty every time I see you. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Even if it's a car bakke, I like the cover song, and the cover song is so cool.
=
No, So Yeon raps well, composes well, writes well, arranges well, and plays on stage. Are you good at dancing now? I was hit by a real dan Soyeon ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The reason why I didn't arrange the arrangement was that it was good that I had to reconsider Park Bom and other 2NE members. So Yeon also arranged for memorable reminiscence. There's that Paap
=
I've never seen Queendom, but I only see children. This stage is 6th? ㄹㅇ
=
I come to see you every day.
=
Miyeon is really pretty ..
=
Fire has a strong personality and many people know that if you arrange too much, you might be compared with 2ne1 fire at 3 positions, and you may not feel 2ne1. I was curious but there were people who missed the intense and unique melody of 2ne1fire at that time, so it was good to arrange the concept jungle feeling unique to the children (Ratata, Han: Egypt) while making a proper arrangement. The song was so famous that it was very burdensome and difficult to arrange. If you do not arrange too much Lovelyz
=
I was in wealth today.
=
Real children are all over the wall
=
I keep seeing every time I'm on fire youtube ㅠ ㅡ ㅠ Why was the sixth. Of course I caught up with the original song, but I still do not understand why I did this stage and sixth place. It's going to be ㅠㅠ Jeon So Yeon rap parts and Su Sujin dance all the time I'm sorry to see you all the time.
=
Jeon So-yeon What's really bad?
If you cover 2NE1 among female idols, you don't think there will be a better group than children.
=
How can this be sixth? What is Six Senses
=
If you listen to 2:11, the chain on the rainy season clothes ?? Sound
=
I'm crazy .... I'm a rookie with Aizu One, so I'll be the best rookie out there ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Why are you doing well?
=
This is 6th place
=
This video is 10 videos per day
=
If you're pretty, Sujin
=
I loved it. It was a nostalgic song, and I put the team color in the middle. But I adjusted it well. If you arranged too much, it would not be enough to bring out the nostalgia of the masterpiece, and if you followed too much, it would be better to see 2ne1.
I think it's the stage where I caught two rabbits.
Soyeon is really smart.
I know what the team has, what each person is good at, what the song feels and what they want.
=
Of course, compared to the original song, you have no choice but to lack,
=
Where have we gotten all the shoe parts?
=
So Yeon's reaction is just like this ㅠㅠ I've been watching the stage and everyone is in nostalgia and I've been listening to the songs I've been listening to for a long time.
=
1:29
My favorite part ♡
=
Why did you know Minnie now?
=
Aminni gets tired
=
Is this song not in the sound source ?? There's only 2NE1 songs but no Queendom Fire ...
=
Lol Soonyeon chewed
=
Akali!
=
Soyeonipu
=
I'm not really convinced and noisy for children 6, but the opponent is too small to be the next stage, as the poisonous jeonsoyeon.
=
The stage was sixth? How great is the high rank, so I should see it.
=
I'm done. I love you. I'm 8 years old.
=
Nowadays, it's 6th place
=
If you look at other videos and see this video, it seems that the picture quality is too low.
=
Oh ~~~~ Good!
=
I'm the youngest and the youngest. It's been a while since Lovelyz debuted, and I thought it was the sixth place. Of course, all the girl groups have no bad feelings. And this pro was a competition.
+) No ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ 6th place is not good at least 3 ~ 4th place is deserved, but it is worse than Lovely Six Sense.
=
Sounds good
=
What is the charm of Shu?
=
It's as if they announced it's a sixth place manipulation.
Honestly, there are no kids in the idol who can handle this 2ne1-Fire.
=
Yes, I don't believe it, but this is the last thing ^^^
=
I feel like I'm lost in the game.
=
I feel it every time
2ne1 songs are hard to cover
But I felt so good but it was the last stage ???
=
I think it's really good on this side, and it's so good that I changed my feelings to the more recent trends rather than arranging them differently than the original ones. I still got a lot of questions .... ㅠㅠ All Time Legend 2ne1 I think I'm good enough to just play with the feeling that they're good enough to melt together ... I didn't look for 2ne1 stage to see this stage itself I'm excited I think it's because I've been met.
=
Minnie looks a bit like a squirrel ............ (personal opinion)
=
Why was this the last time? I still don't understand lining
=
The rainy season is cute and girly, and the voice is low in the atmosphere, so it's better with reverse charm.
=
Compared to 2NE1, the intensity is a bit unfortunate, but it seems to be well arranged and suitable for them. Ethnic arrangements seem so good. They also show their well-equipped meals and strengths and are well organized. In particular, Sujin Doommu in the second half seems to be influential compared to the original song. The skills are good and full of confidence. Should we be excited and assimilated together?
=
My name is Soyeon Lee
=
I couldn't see it again. Now, I think I was hit down because of the ranking and the reaction.
=
I happened to see you, but even if you say yes and don't like the last Ryan, this is so good and you keep seeing it! But I was surprised to hear from my friends .. I don't like this 101 and this program too much.
=
Hyejeong's sister Suzy said that she should have such a clip ... She just ran out of face.
=
Does Mnet have a separate control department; I don't see this stage as a sixth place.
=
Why don't you give melon a sound source?
=
I didn't know if I was going to watch this ♥♥
=
It's a girl idol ... son's game. I'm writing ... Hong Shi ...
=
Minnie at the end ...
=
Each video gets a lot of kids
I still don't understand why this stage is sixth.
=
Amnet This is how we produced this
I was the youngest group of children and watched and manipulated the gel smoothly.
=
It's not a table below, but a checklist ...
How did the stage get 3 votes ... ???????
It's not like they're the best juniors
=
How long will it ever be called overseas fandom red ㅋㅋㅋ
Do children have a big overseas fandom? In fact, the video views are similar to other groups
= It's not just the balance of performance and stage performance, but it's not a fan account suck ^^
In addition, the Naver Cast, which is only viewed by Koreans, will know what the overwhelming number of views proves.
=
I should play Queendom.
=
Apart from everything else, I've done a really good arrangement. I think that Soyeon was concerned about percussion a lot before.
=
You should really give it high even if you look at the rainy season
=
I'm not interested in idols, but I'm surprised to see these guys because Queendom is hot these days ;; I'm really good at it ... I'm good at every single member;
=
Honestly, the original song is over the wall, but the original song feels good and the arrangement is good. Why is this 6th place .... ??? When it's over, the children will be the best
=
Why are you here?
=
6th place but the highest views ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Soyeon is so cool
=
The children always seem to be good on stage.
Honestly why is this?
=
2:05 Is this sixth sense?
=
Pahab <* Fire *
=
All girls, sister, I love you
=
I don't hate Mamamu in spring because the theme of the cover song was the first one, but Mamumu erased the original song so much that I wanted to be out of the theme of the cover song, but the children didn't erase the original song. ... Of course, the original song was so strong that it felt like 2NE1's color rather than children's color.
=
Although the ranking was sixth, the fire was really good, but the number of views ... 13 million ... The highest number of views on the Queen's stage ... No, but it's sixth. !
=
Ending Minnie Good ,,,,, from pronunciation to facial expression
=
Minnie is pretty.
=
This stage is the last one. Blindfolded. There's even Aung. The public has eyes.
=
It was the sixth song, so I came in unexpectedly.
=
15 million views coming soon
=
I'm the best in this stage and I'm the Destiny stage in Queendom. Ryan shot the legend, but the stage is so addictive.
=
Personally, this was a star. The original song was so good that I felt sorry for it.
=
In fact, this ranking is meaningless to them. Anyway, the public knows what they're good at, and I don't expect them to go beyond 2NE1 on this stage. I hope you don't have to worry about being A-level and sixth place.
Anyway, I'm excited by this, so I'm expecting more stages
=
It's crazy from the beginning. Minnie frowns.
=
It's kids, so it's about fire
=
The audience was more memorable because I didn't arrange it like a completely different song.
=
2NE1 is so strong that it's a great stage.
=
If you came to watch Korean video, please use Google Translator
=
I don't know why I received a lower rating than Leupeup. Children are worth it.
=
It is pro during small professional!
=
.....? The sixth place was hit.
=
I look back at it and I'm dotted with Shu Hwa.
=
If you see 2ne1 live on fire in 2009 ...
=
So why did Soyeon fall? (The monster god that surviving bees ...
=
I only see rainy hair.
=
No Youtube Fire and Destiny No. 1
Is there regret? I recommend only fire and destiny to recommendation,
=
It's not a song that is over-arranged as a good thing for children,
=
Sixteenth place with 14 million views?
=
When are you going to stop playing Meg? Ugh .. Ugh ... Ugh !!!!!
=
Honestly, 2NE1 is an overkill wall, but I have to admit that it's great.
No other idol would have felt this much
=
Every time I see them, I don't think there's a team that's as good as the kids.
These days, when they push out with the innocent and sexy concept, they come out with the girl crush concept and the harmony between the members is so beautiful.
Minni's acting and Sujin's dance Miyeon's song Soyeon's squeak and the rainy season's heavy voice?
=
Losing credibility of the ranking because the song which is second in the bodyguard's evaluation and the difference between the vote and vote is the last
It's even an Mnet program.
Although the fire is strong
Jungle feels good and there are lots of performances arranged in the middle to give differentiation
In addition, Sujin's character is unique, so I think Sujin pulled out the original song.
I'm not second in the bodyguard vote.
If you're going to play like this, don't you make a sixth place in a row.
=
It's really coming
The sung cotyledon ...
=
Jeon So Yeon is a rap if a rap is a rap dance. It's a punk. It's very tight.
=
Question: If you hit YouTube and view order, this video gets the most views
=
If you loose your hair, your scalp will hurt
=
Oh My Girl and Eo were too strong to have to give me at least third place.
=
Let's go to Queendom 2
=
Except for views and public reaction
The other members' expressions aren't answering just how you did it?
=
Is there anyone who has the word Sujin really?
=
No matter how much you look at it
=
Jeon Soyeon was born in Korea ;;; Cosmic producer ...
=
If you're going to do a hug Mnet,
=
Jeon So-yeon is so famous and not able to say that he is a talented member, and that member is really going to see him again.
=
Hey, who's braided your hair
=
Miss 2NE1
=
Please take a look at the automatic creation of subtitles
=
Is this sixth place?
=
Long time no see!
=
Is it only me that I feel scared and greatly disappointed? I sing 2ne1.
=
So Jeon Soon is unique and if I don't have an idol, I'm really good at it. Don't be deceived while playing Queendom.
=
I think the children were sacrificed to stop Lovelyz from falling out.
=
My head is full of Chalang Chalang Shuhwa Part.
=
It's Miyeon Wye so it definitely shows the original vocals
=
Why is this sixth? If it was lowered because it was too bad for the original song ... If other teams did it, wouldn't it? Of course, the original song is excellent, but this arrangement
I don't fall behind and I think it's trendy and well arranged, and I think children can express it best .. ㅎㅎ Saying I don't like it.
=
Sawyer or a real sister loves you ...
=
Every time they chew all of their views, if I talk about this on TV, I'm so good
=
Did you send yourself down to the sixth place because you weren't expecting it?
=
Intro 'love love love love'
I think it's over. You're the first.
=
4:01 She's sexy and it's sexy itself ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ TT TT ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅜㅠ TT
=
The kids' stage is so perfect, why is it so low?
=
Hyo-jeong and Seung-hee are said to be cute in the rainy season.
=
It's okay, the number of hits has already proved ridiculous by the number of hits, and now it's time for Lion to write Soyeon's song.
=
04:04 Whoever says mvp runner
=
3:55 Legend
=
Kids are so amazing!
=
Ugh ~~ Too good a problem ~~!
=
I was really tired of seeing this stage .... ;;;;;;
=
Children are unconditional first place ~~~
Who dared to think of a jungle concept in a 2NE1 song ??? I'm a genius!
=
If you're not in first place, you're in fourth place.
=
Burned down ,,,,, 0
=
No. Why is this sixth?
Even though I didn't really decide
I couldn't catch anything 2ne1
Then did you catch up with Six Senses?
Please perfect it
=
Mnet's still a rookie, so he looks down and manipulates it.
=
Why is this six?
=
What's this lower than Six Sense?
=
I think they're sixth
6th from behind
=
To be honest, they are so cool,
=
Didn't you just hear me shout 2NE1 when you said "Eaeaeaeae" in the beginning?
=
Amnet did it again?
=
Wait, I don't watch this. I watch videos on Youtube. Does that make sense ...?
=
But it is hard to follow 2NE1
2NE1's overwhelm and the tone of the atmosphere are unavoidable.
=
This is sixth place
=
I miss you 2ne1
=
I feel so good every time I see you.
=
How are you?
To express the color while making the original song feel
It's a genius, but it feels like a jungle.
=
This song must have been thought of as a song that swept the whole generation before it was evaluated, and the children made the stage with respect ... Everyone would recall the memories while the stage came out, and even the spring was happy ... Even if someone really did cover or arrange it, it would be underestimated, but I think I couldn't make a better remake. If I was one of the children, I would have been really upset when I tried to sing 2NE1 ... I think it would be hard to applaud the children who made up the stage with respect and respect.
=
I don't have children, but 2NE1 is so hard that I can only think of 2NE1.
=
I think I got the table below so I don't want to drop off next door.
=
It's the same as Lovelyz Reaction at 2:05, it's more like Fire choreography than Six Sense;
=
No, Eo and Park Bom are good at the beginning, and even the stage is well organized.
=
No, is it really the last thing to do on this stage? Or am I really trying to do all kinds of shit? Really lol.
=
Reflect on the crew. Why are you so crazy?
=
I think you can see who is doing better by just hitting it.
6th place.
Don't do voting this time.
=
No, how do you have a lot of shoe parts?
To be real, you're just dancing.
Divide normally
What is this
I did everything well, but please share the shoe parts.
=
Only me come to listen to this once a day ㅠㅠ each member is very attractive, especially Soyeon introduction is very attractive .. How is this sixth ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Why are these guys the most on the table below? Why do you notice survival pros?
=
This is why 6th person is so great
=
2ne1 sound is so unique that I can't follow the original.
=
Park Bom Middle I think I'm thinking .. I want to show it to Dara, especially I'm really mun tt ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅜㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ
=
What's your name?
ㅎㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ Please look at the version number of the number ............ Summer load ..... Fast fast ....... ^^^^^^ ㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ !! @@@ --- ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ @ ???? My wife has a voice .... Yes. ....... ㅅㄹ ㅎㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ -------- Introduction to Gamgam .......... ㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ ... I don't know. ...... I'm going to work ... I'm going to work ... Stop at the bar ....... ㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ ㅎㅎㅎ Love etc.? How about ...
=
And the views are crazy. The views are crazy. I did it and came
=
Because of this, I become a fire runner
=
Is it because the fire of 2ne1 is intense? I'm different ...
=
Here's a little Minnie Eightin 'like Kang Min Ah
=
Sujin, I feel Hyuna ...
=
Wow, this is the number one view in the entire Queendom video.
=
We are looking for in-depth discussions about why there is no direct cam
=
Personally, this stage is sixth place in doubt and it is too sad because there is no sound source. I always show new concept and stage beyond imagination.
=
Honestly, children or who would do this?
=
Wow .. Minny, look at the last part.
=
The song interpretation, arrangement, singing power, the performance are sixth place so much.
=
Let's work on Mnet
Why do you give a sixth place to these good kids?
If you're going to broadcast, you should do it right .. ;;
=
I can't even understand it yet.
=
If the number of real video views is reflected, the children are the first, but whether the audience is just a gugget or the crew has manipulated it again ...
I'm so sorry ..
=
I really love children .. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I couldn't understand why I was 6th place in my house
=
It's cute over the rainy season ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I want to touch my hair ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Ah .. So Yeon is really pretty and cool..❤
=
Thanks to the children, I don't really care about the rankings this time, but I put the colors of the children, but I thought it was a consideration to keep the original song of Twonione as much as possible.
=
Husky is a husky voice..❤❤
=
I can't forget Sujin's fishing.
=
It's so cute ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's cute because the rainy season
=
Queendom children's stage daily review❣
=
I wasn't fascinated by the fan screaming hahahaha
=
You can't live.
=
Jeon So Yeon Lee Genius ......
=
Big Jeon So-yeon is the best part of the live certification, while crying loudly ...
So Yeon Jeon
Chomi Yeon
Yeshua
Songwoogi
Sujin
Minni Kim
The best kids ㅠㅠ
=
This was the old blackjack history, I received this stage and got to know the best things this year.
=
I'm good, but I want to be crazy
I want to shout
=
1:35 Crush !!!!
=
The rap friend grabbed the stage.
=
Yes, this is the stage
More than 10 million views and just torn the stage ^^
=
I keep seeing this
AOA-You're Park Bom-One Girl-Latata Girls-Fire
Girls, say no
=
Minnie is so pretty and I love you ♡ ☆ ₩ !!
=
Ooh .. Sujin's crazy ..
=
That's what we're like. What's this? Don't you see?
=
Honestly, I thought it was the first place in a row.
Destiny was good in the second round
I didn't have 1st place but I thought I could at least 3rd place
Park Bom continues to be ranked 5th for artist mental management
I thought I had to adjust the ranks to some extent
I'm blind to betham and I agree with Aung ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Amnet Chevala
=
Honestly, I want to do Mi + ⑦ This is a real killing part
=
I see why you gave that microphone to Soyeon.
=
The rainy season's head is only ... The rainy season's head is only seen from far away
=
Sujin Eve inline
=
No, I love these crazy sisters. Just eat them.
=
I didn't see Queendom well, but I don't know other teams, but Park Bom, kids, Oh My Girl caught my eyes.
=
Jeon So Yeon is really creepy
=
One of the groups that will really lead the fourth generation.
=
Honestly, the 6th place I don't understand
=
All other members are good and not to mention Jeon So-yeon, but I was really shocked when I first saw this group. I watched a dancing video, but what was this really like? I didn't know what it was, but I didn't know what it was. The dance line was so unique that I was confused at the same moment.
=
If you cover it, it's comparable and keeps going; ㅋㅋ You've staged to jump over the original song It means that you're re-interpreting the legendary song with your own group style. This is why 2NE1 won't follow you anymore. I wouldn't think so.
=
There are some people who say that there is no difference from the original song.
Want to have a stage to communicate with people
Perhaps because of this stage, I wanted something like 2ne1 stage like nostalgia.
This children's stage was different from the original stage while adding original children's feeling ethnic.
=
The weight of the original song is so big that it sounds like it's good for kids.
2NE1 was so monstrous. So CL wanted to see him as a rookie.
=
I'm good at this, but I don't know why I got three under one ...
=
Why is this so bad? Why is it so low?
=
I was so good at the first time that I had high expectations, and the song itself called fire was too strong for 2ne1. More than any other song, this song couldn't be thought of by the original song, but the weight on the stage was a bit uncomfortable compared to the original song, but the arrangement and stage composition were too good. Even though I looked at each person, I did my best within my stats, especially the person who digests CL parts as much as I have not seen yet. Sujin Danv was good.
First of all, I want to give a high score to the challenge of fire. I felt it was not that easy. And the first one is sure to take a picture of the eye, while the second is a good strategy to try the songs they want to play even if you risk a little. I think it would be a good experience for the children who are so promising.
=
Does it make sense that this is the last ??? Mnet No Amnet Manipulation is definitely something that should be pointed out;
=
Goose bumps all the time. Children are like idols with enough ability to recreate their own colors. I hope you will continue to grow up to hear a lot of good songs
=
I'm good at it. 2NE1 can't follow it.
=
Soyeon Rap is really good ..
=
The children are good but sorry, the original song is chenumsa ...
=
Honestly, this is not for children, but 2NE1 is so bad ... No one can cover 2NE1.

6th stage
# 1 views
Fight for fans
Did the females do the trick?
Crazy
=
Jungle Arrangement is incredible ㅋㅋㅋ I think it's sixth place in self-assessment. I'll only be strong
=
I teach you to hold the microphone with your left hand
Jeon So-yeon seems to be holding the right hand with the microphone.
=
Wow, Mi-yeon is from Wye.
=
The highest number of girls song views
You don't have to say Mnet.
=
3:56 Sujin is crazy
I really went to Mexico to see this.
=
This is a 6-man operation. If the first year rookie is the first contestant, the senior singer's agency doesn't look good.
=
2:35 Soojin's part fan is wow .. Ahhhhh .. Killing part ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I love you.
=
2:37 What's the scream?
=
3:55 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
1:47 Minnie is cute.
Minnie looks so cute
=
2:14 The rainy season is so cute ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Like a baby, the voice is spread over the best ㅠㅠㅠ
=
3:55 Sujin
=
How is this lower than K-pop?
=
3:54 I love you
=
2:17 Cute sister next cute sister next cute sister next cute sister next wow;
=
I've been watching pa ~ ap and seeing this, it's funny because there's too much soul in other team reactions.
=
I don't know why it's sixth
=
Are you crazy? ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I searched the Queendom but it's still at the top, so I pushed it as our children but it's 6th place ...? What happened to the world?
=
Minnie is so cute.
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius
=
Sujin is definitely good at facial expression and acting.
=
I really want to listen to this song.
=
Why is there anybody talking about the rainy season?
=
Minnie ... Be free for life. TT TT TT TT TT Last Eye + Eye Makeup = Fantastic.
=
This is number one for me
=
Ugi hair ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I'll give you the sound source.
=
The rainy season one cam is taking a lot of ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Let's keep Rub Sense and why is this 6th place?
=
Sujin TT 1:29 3:21
=
Queendom, apart from anything else, please don't want singers up and down like this ...
Just voting itself is individual.
Make each other noisy .... except for voting each other.
=
I'm trying to bully the idols out of Queendom. I don't know what's missing.
=
I still don't understand why it's sixth in Fire!
=
It's like Idols who are really idols these days. If you learn the technology, you'll have to debut. It's not a crazy stage, but it's the maximum that kids can show.
=
No can't view by hit? Why is this sixth place?
=
Soyeon I'm really good at it. I've never seen it properly.
=
I told them I didn't like it, and everyone came back.
=
Like the fourth and sixth places
=
Even though the children are hitting the batter, I think it's a good place to listen to the original song all the time.
=
That's just good for the kids, but damn Mnet is so good that he doesn't like the next six side senses. It doesn't even come up in melon
Thank you
=
It's a little bit like a sneak peek when they're in the wrong stage, but it's almost always coming and listening. I honestly don't think that's what they did. When I decided to arrange the song, I decided to use the ethnic whip genre. At that time, I thought it was a genius, and I thought I was crazy at the sound of the chieftain (?).
=
Why is this 6th place ... Honestly, Lovelyz should have been 6th place. I couldn't listen to the music because I wasn't able to win the game.
=
I'm sorry I just gave it to Lovelyz, so I wanted to give the kids good 2ne1 song is so famous and nostalgic.
=
I think it's good for 2NE1 song. Miyeon's voice doesn't fit this song.
=
Mnet is ..... Vote operation ....
=
I'm going to make this kind of program earlier. Queendom teams put legends on every plum. How frustrating it was.
=
Sujin is really crazy ...
But it's a really big group of Twonione. It's a great group.
=
Honestly, I don't know it's 1st in the stage, but it's better than Lovelyz
=
I don't understand yet that the largest number of children in the self-assessment Lovelyners, sorry to say that they are no better than Lovelyz
=
Honestly from my standards
1st place: Omgirl
2nd place: Children
3.Mamamu
4.AOA
5th place
6th place: Spring
Even though Omgirl fans see, Destiny is empty if you don't have a video. This stage is just good for singing.
=
Honestly, it's like children
=
Oh, I'm really mad at this stage, and I'm upset to see more than 20 times a day.
=
In other comments, I did not change a measure by Jeon So-yeon, who is good at rapmaking, but it means that it was a two-one one. Thank you for saving the original song so that everyone can think about it.
=
Wow, modern arrangement was good, but 6th place is really serious. Mnet should be fair or the centipede should be a good example, and it's too much and like Queendom Unpretty it's really falling and it's like a different girl group Amnett Real
=
It looks so small in shoe parts
=
Like this, the next stage is biting and the crew gave 6th place to keep shooting legends.
=
I'll take Jeon So-yeon to the end.
=
I think it's a lot of emotions ... After a few years of music in his heyday, the junior group covers it nicely .. ㅠㅠ
=
3:55 what does it look like? It's full of real charm.
=
I don't know if Minnie is Thai.
=
No, I don't understand that it's a shame. Did you save Lovelyz from work early?
=
At first, it was rainy season to do it.
=
Soyeon is Sujin! I feel so proud of Sujin
=
Replying to @Taiwan
=
The gap on the stage and on the stage is love..❤
=
Children are doing best ~ ❤️
=
ㅋㅋㅋ Do you go up as you go ㅋㅋㅋ ㅠㅠㅠ Let the children conquer the world ㅠㅠㅠ
=
When someone pretends to be pretty, the one who shows her like she looks more beautiful
=
I've hit views ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ At last the man is wow! I'm so funny about doing it;
=
Shuhua head comes in every day to listen
=
The kids are cool ...
=
What is this?
=
Sujin Crosses the Dead Wall
=
I love you seo jin, really,
=
I keep looking, but ...
Why the hell is this stage so bad
The number one view is ...
=
Namdol even wanted to join the fan club, but the children really want to join ㅠㅠ Soyeonyeon I want to work hard and I'm so cool, looking at each other drove the table below
Too honest, the rest of the team is honest, it's hard to rank.
=
You've surpassed ten million views ... Why is it sixth? Why is this ... ???????? You're number one in my heart.
=
Children are good at singing, dancing, and have a lot of clothes.
=
But it's a pity that So-yeon and Su-jin only have a long solo part ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Don't play Mnet .. If you get back to the results, let's see where you go. You're tired.
=
Something addictive
=
4:03 Sujin
=
Soyeon is Sujin! Was it just me when I called
=
Oh really Sujin I'm crazy like a lion I'm brave and cool
=
Girls are so good
=
Hyejeong nerd
=
And I grind it in the 3rd and say that I don't want to wear dentures.
=
Why do I suddenly miss 2NE1 stages?
Perfume TT TT TT TT
=
If this is 6th place, the 3 votes are idols
=
Is this sixth? Am I crazy?
=
ㅇㄴ The public likes this 6th? Is it? The gel views are high and everyone likes it. Where are you looking at ...? How is the dodeche ranking reflected in the 6th place? Because we make the best every time, children's reply pack! ♡♡♡
=
I feel it every time I see it
I don't really understand
Is there always a little bit of parts
=
Why is this so ??
=
Just .. God Soyeon
=
I don't think there are a few people who pronounce rum when they do it like everyone else. Rr ㅓㅁ Ilke ..
=
I'm really good. Despite 6th place, the number of views is 1st.
=
You did a good job
=
Honestly, Soyeon ... What's wrong with you ... You're so cool ... And passionate. And the rest of the members are so cool. I don't understand why you're in 6th place. Could it be pulled down? He is a student;
=
I did well, but the original song was so overcast, so I just did well. Looking at the level, I think 2NE1 is 2NE1.
=
Minni is able to digest a variety of images ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ According to the hair makeup, it looks like a different person, the tone is good, but these songs are naturally digested and hidden
=
I like them so much
Honestly, if you've done this with fire ...
=
Jeon So-yeon is Jeon So-yeon. She's a little thin, so I think you've done a good job of distributing the parts that suit you in the back. As you can see, it's comparable to Lovelyz.
=
It's a lower rank than Lovelyz ?? It's a sixth place.
=
The original song itself is a song with a strong color, but it seems to be perfectly digested with its own color .. Because the expectation is high .. There are not a few groups that can cover this much. I'm sorry for Lovelyz, but it's like Six Sense and Fire. It's a song with a strong color, and the completeness is obvious depending on how you have the ability to interpret the song and make it your own color.
=
Didn't you see the guys saying that this isn't an operation? I can't help but tell you that you've beaten Lovelyz.
=
Original 2NE1 is full of color and strongly cut, but this was good
=
2NE1's Park Bom as well as CL's civic map was really awesome. Jeon So Yeon is also characteristic.
=
I'm so good at the youngest children and I've done so well.
Anyway, the stage was really good ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I hope this group is big ..
=
Sujin ...........
=
Honestly, this should have given me fourth place,
=
The children are so scared that they are so good. The children are so good. Jeon So-yeon is really crazy and other friends are so good at it and he seems to know why Miyeon was in the rat.
=
So-yeon is like a girl jidi .. Not to follow, but the skills are so good. Children are almost like producers.
Sujin is not only good at dancing, but she is full of people.
=
Amnet, don't mess up.
What's wrong with children
=
Seolhyun was the best compliment, "It's like Park Bom at that time."
=
Everyone is watching the stage, but Mamamu, when they were in school, these songs are soaked in memories lol.
Why is there no sound in Flo?
=
It's sixth so don't tee off.
=
Jeon So-yeon is so good at not entering clc
=
3:56 Wow ..... Wow ..... Wow ..
=
No, it lost to Paab? Does that make sense ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I really don't know why
=
Even after this program, I hope the children will have a sixth sense in a concert.
=
Really hard and good
My head is full of sexy voice
1:59 This visitor is impressive.
=
You're in charge, I'm taking a test today. I've been thinking about this part.
=
It's not a waste if all the children are first
=
It's almost MV level.
=
Replying to @RussianGarden
=
Sister dog
=
I keep seeing them again ... I've come back to see the 3rd car ... I think there are so many killing parts.
=
What's that 6th place?
=
I didn't know Shu Hwa and the rainy season sound
=
Ane is more emotional than a knife. Color difference
=
Thank you so much Mnet. Thanks to the sixth place on this stage, Ul So-yeon made her look so cool over the third and third stage.
=
Ranking stage I do not understand ...
While watching the broadcast, two bewildered ....... They were so good even though they weren't fans.
=
This is the last thing ... It's ridiculous.
=
0:26 Why am I good at obscure cuts, not shadows or faces? I don't know anything but you need something .. I love you Soon-yeon .. I just love you ........
=
Hits are really amazing Fortress kids Say I don't like it I'm listening to the songs
=
Wow, I'm really looking at this video .... I'm a fan of this video.
=
I'll be a fan forever
=
Does it make sense to be in 6th place? I have the highest views
=
Sleep, why is this sixth crazy?
But Park Bom comes out for a while too cute;-;
=
Perfor is cool and really good, but it's hard to pass the vocal character. The vocal color of Park Bok is so thick in the original song. The part is rather opposite rainy season, so it's good to have a different taste, but Spring Part reminds me of Park Bok's not being forgotten.
But it goes well with concept children
=
It's been a million years since I didn't play the music. I really want to hear it with melon. Why don't you give it? ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
If you register the sound source, you'll pay Ul Soyeon's bank account for less cursing.
=
Queendom's biggest beneficiaries come with their children.
=
How is this 6th place?
=
This is sixth place ...?
=
It would have been nicer to have the concept like a jungle chief and put a small firearm like a campfire.
=
How do you think this is sixth?
Please convince me please
=
Jeon So-yeon's crazy arrangement is a senior song, so I wondered if he wanted to save it.
=
Kim Minni .. Yeah, the makeup goes well .. Crazy.
=
Sixth place more hits than the first place
=
I've said that I don't like it, but it feels like people on the stage are changing their souls.
=
The children are a very unique group, so So-yeon says Min-woo Sui is very excited, but Suhwa and Mi-yeon feel the harmony of their faces and concepts. I don't talk about Shu Hwa and Mi Yeon, but even if I didn't have one of the six members, the children would never have come to this conclusion.
=
This live tina is so good on stage .. Even if you sing well, if you move violently, you should naturally melt those breaths.
=
I used the jungle material well and chewed on the part of Ababa. It's amazing that it's 6th place .. Honestly, most of them were good, but it wasn't.
=
I don't understand so much of the table below.
=
The original color is very strong, but if you do it low, it's very good. How much do you want ?, How high is your expectation?
=
Although this song has a strong 2NE1 feeling, the group that covered it so well did well, but I was wondering why it was the 6th place in self-assessment and I was so curious why it was compared to Pahab ~ ❤️. I think it's the best or give 6th place to Pahab ~ ❤️ So I think I gave 6th place to children who don't have gel
=
I feel it every time I see it, but it's creepy
=
Jeon So-yeon is one hundred
Dancing song rap expression
There's nothing you can't do on stage
=
The more I look at Sujin, I feel like Narsha
=
No, try to get rid of the foggy mist It's too much even if you don't
=
Why is this sixth? I don't understand
=
The kids always seem to grasp the concept too well and everyone is good but Jeon So-yeon is a real stage genius ..
=
1.25 times
=
Just be honest with your skills and drop the team quickly
And it would be more fun to stick with the top ones, but I don't know if Mnet or his company paid for it.
=
Park Bom looks like a mother who wants to brag
=
Sujin is what he really does.
=
After the sixth place, the children showed their stage by saying 'I don't like it' by grinding their teeth and chewing them with their gums. Let's go to the third round first place!
=
No other group did so well, but the kids weren't falling behind. Personally, this is the most memorable
=
No I don't really understand
Why are you so last?
=
Park Bom being the cutest “I wanna show this to dara” ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Regardless of the ranking, it was recognized by the public
Well done and cool kids
=
3:56 Seo Soo Jin
=
2:37 Who are you crying?
=
The most questioned is that this was the sixth performance ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
This is not the 6th place
=
Minni says, 'I want to be Mimimimimi' but it's crazy because the pronunciation is so hazy, hip and deep and @ & ₩ & # *
South Korea quickly create adjectives that can express Minnie's tone
=
No wonder why this is so cool
=
I'm just gonna beat it ...
=
Louis first female and European people like Europe all know ..... Like that really suits you guys ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ But I really like it so I just like my taste?
=
Queendom Total YouTube views ranked # 1
^^ ,,
=
There is no talk about Miyeon Shuhwa, but two members are better than other members. If Woojin Minni Soyeon Sujin paints, Miyeon Shuhwa looks like a drawing paper or palette.
=
How do you think the 12 million views are sixth?
=
ㅋㅋㅋ This performance is sixth place ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius.

1:14 Fuck !!
=
2nd place vote-Don't be sad about Mnet operation!
=
This is better than Lovelyz, why are you so bad?
=
I started seeing Queendom because I'm an ombuds fan, but I thought I and Om Girls won first place ... Mnet's voting results are open.
=
Conscientiously, this is the sixth place. I thought it would be at least fourth place.
=
It was a stage where the colors of the children were saved and the memories were taken out again. As I watched this stage, I felt that the feelings of 2NE1 and children were definitely different. Nevertheless, I tried to save the original song as much as possible. Thank you for showing a good stage. Cheer up the road ahead.
=
Look at this Is it sixth ....
=
Isn't this the stage that's going to be ridiculous?
=
I don't really understand why this is the 6th place.
=
Why is this ???????? I don't understand. I can't see my face. So-yeon can't see the stage. ㅠㅠㅠ ????
=
This is crazy
=
From 0:42 Jeon So Yeon walked proudly my favorite part
=
The kids are really good too but I just saw 2ne1 mom stage ..... The original song is the original song ......
=
Please put this song in melon ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow .. Hits are crazy. If you chew again
=
It doesn't really make sense that this stage finished sixth.
=
After seeing this,
Oh ...
=
Whenever I see Sujin Part in Queendom
The right punk ...
=
Ah ~ Everything is perfect, but I hope the arrangement is more powerful for choreography! The only thing I'm sorry ㅠㅠㅠ Write and honestly compared to the kids who lip-sync, children are mostly live live ㅠㅠㅠ really different skills. I want everyone to be angry at Mnet's tricks and reflect on Mnet. So So Yeon is so cool and Su Jin is so sexy !!!! 꺄 !!! Cute rainy season !! Mi-yeon is singing this song.
=
It's creepy to see the performances like Tarzan together in the late jungle concept.
=
The better you see it, the better you see it.

I wasn't really good at it, and since I left, I felt really good about it.
I was really good though
Look at everyone in the waiting room and see how excited they are.
=
If you have a small part
The atmosphere is changing
=
Wow, I really don't have a lot of exposure, and the dance isn't very sexy.
=
I think it's better not to compare with 2NE1, but it's a feeling that reminds me of memories. When I make a lot of arrangements, I compare them.
=
But it wasn't enough for six;
Honestly, Lovelyz should be sixth.
Soyeon, Sujin are really good at this stage.
=
I don't really understand what this stage is like in this arrangement in this song ..... I can't understand it even if I keep turning it back.
=
How is this the sixth place?
=
I did really well, but I also showed the color, but 2NE1 Fire is over the wall.
=
I feel like a song is full because a rap girl stands up.
=
Expected, but if the children fall, Amnet Queendom's rating will drop by half.
Honestly, I think I can apply it if I try to arrange the arrangement concept with one Jeon So-yeon. See Queendom to see
Idol children are the only idol children here
=
Can you replace YouTube ????? Please comment function by country .. I want to sympathize with Korean people.
=
The most important thing is that no one thinks it's the sixth child. There's a group you've decided on before the results come out?
=
Rethink No. 6 It's even higher than the number of hits in the Latata MV lol.
=
Let's fight Queendom. There is no limit to the operation.
What kind of kids do you want to run ... No. 1 number of hits? It's a lot of popular gels, but ... I know your own vote.
=
Replying to @David_Golden @YouTube

Honestly, let's give Cube a place for So-yeon.

I can't imagine children without yeon ...
No, how is that force rookie .... ?????
=
I'm really tired of this stage and it's a real stage
=
Sujin screams at the extraction lol
=
Park Bom is good! Let's respond too! I want to show Dara!
=
Why is this sixth?
=
03:55 Sujin Killing Part ,,
=
The more I look at it, the better .. I think it's too bad for the original song, but I think there's no girl group to save this song.
=
This stage is so good that I come to watch the 1st day of the day, but it's also addictive to see the hymns at first.
=
Congratulations Queens
=
3:55 Crazy
=
I couldn't forget the stage where the color was strong, but it seems to have been re-implemented with the original color of the children.
=
Closed mind, they made history ♥ ️
=
And views
=
Jeon So Yeon? Wow ..
=
Jackpot :)
=
How can this stage be under 3 votes ?? A little oversea
=
Oh my girl-aoa 1st and 2nd children honestly 3rd ???????
=
It is the best to see and see again,
=
This is sixth place;
=
Jeon So-yeon
=
If you want to be bored, Jeon So-yeon comes out and pulls everything up.
=
What year are you singing?
=
It's true that the original songs are so full that it doesn't make any sense to cover any of them, but it's the only group in the team that can cover them except Park Bom.
=
I ran to see the ugly children running after me.
=
Oh, can't you show comments by country?
=
Wow, I'm a real rookie. I'm a perfect fit. Shu Hwa I originally laughed on stage. I didn't know how to do this but it was really crazy
=
The feeling of the original song was added, and the new performance was added to make the cover stage feel good. The reason for receiving the 3 votes below is obvious.
Queendom After all, children will get the most attention. So far, even if you look at the title song, the concept 1 overlaps.
=
Is this the sixth place in self-assessment ??????? I used the colors and original feels well like this ... Rather, like other teams, if I change the atmosphere and cover it, it would be different from the fire that the public expected
=
This is 6th place ...? Lovely
What is Liz? If this is lower than Lovelyz, it's a shock.
=
If children fall, contact Mnet.
=
If a group other than children did it, would it be better than this? It's not a rage.
If another group did it, they would have sweared like Paab
=
Sujin Crazy
=
After all children
=
And Jeon So-yeon can't really follow anyone.
=
It wasn't the 6th stage, but I was really excited because this song is a song and people are almost uncomfortable.
=
0: 432: 49 3: 36 * Infinite Repetition *
=
2NE1 debut stage alone
=
The wives are good, but it's not my taste for fire songs.
=
Sujin is really like a hidden card ....
=
picnic
=
Okay, 350,000. I don't think it's 20,000. Overwhelming difference, but it's not like Lovelyz Six Sense !? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I loved it all, but I was the one I liked the most .. including other groups and children's videos, I loved the performances and songs. The rap is so clingy that I don't feel 2ne1 and expressed it well
=
Okay, just do whatever you like with Mnet. The public has chosen children, and the music market is also decided by the public.
=
Is it true that Soyeon is born in 1998? Even though it's not the CL class, it's clear that the top ranks are among the domestic girls. Sujin's really unique person makes everybody look crazy .... This stage is also annoying
=
I still don't understand why this song is not the best
=
I still don't understand .. Why are they sixth? Personally, I think they're good next to Oh My Girl. I don't think the kids are good at Queendom, they know their colors well and feel confident on stage. character
=
I'm a real newcomer and I'm the best idol of 3 years.
In the peaceful countries of that peaceful age,
It's different from one of the victorious nations in the Edo era, which I've been hitting with each other.
=
I'm creepy all the time to see what I'm lacking.
=
Khm Monga is like a collection of gods in Indian mythology
=
TT TT It's so good When it was YG, the music won't come out .. I'm so sad.
=
It's another fan but I think it's best. The original song feels good.
=
There is no one who can follow the skills ..
=
4:26 Moon's face looks so exciting.
=
Jeon So-yeon enjoys the real stage ㅋㅋ ㅋ ㅋㅋ dancing is too passionate to see.
=
Why am I looking at this? Tears come out. I am so memory. I want to go back to that time.
=
1:58 I see you crying so hard.
=
2:54 Remind you to see each dance line in bouncing.
=
I wonder why it's not the 6th place and why it's not the 1st place.
=
I gave it to Shuhua
=
And it's been # 1
=
4:00 Hyejung had to have such a squeeze, and she didn't have a bad face. At this time, Hyejeong didn't think that she was a normal rookie.

If they do not win, they will go bankrupt and there are many fans
=
Mamamu is funny in the middle

And Shu Hwa
=
6th, but different views

But the second contest among the six groups is the most popular. ㅋㅋ This is too much for the sixth place. It was second place by one vote.
=
But it's very addictive so my head is fluttering. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Real Soyeon Let's Go! And it's good to see 3:03
=
Oh, really Minnie's hair is so full .. Minnie, let's be eternal .. ❤️❤️
=
It's not the stage for 6th look again
=
How many times have I been looking back ... This is sixth?
=
Jeon So-yeon is not an energy joke.
=
I thought it was okay from my point of view, but at least rather than Lovelyz ...
=
I love this song! Shu Hwa, Minnie, Sujin, Ugi Fighting !! Go forward!
=
Jeon So-yeon
=
I'm crazy
It's unique.
=
As soon as you start see everyone shouting 2ne1
=
Minnie sister! Please sign! I'm a fan!
(Mini visual crazy ... girl)
=
Seo Sujin, my life is responsible!
=
Sujin...
=
Sign Language
To make my head flutter
I'm pretty over my voice
When you come out, you will hear it again.
=
Why the hell are you?
=
2ne1 is overwhelmed by the stage of the CL gauze stage
I seduced you twice by dancing
Then I'll put it on with Park Bom + Legs
The children let Soyeon come first, and Sujin danced too, but Miyeon was too mingling with stars.
=
This part is good
=
Queendom Max Beneficiary Children Omgirl Vegirl
=
This time, the table below was given to Lovelyz, so I don't want to drop it.
=
Honestly, I didn't think 2NE1 is so unique ... but I think I did well.
=
It's funny that the self-assessment is not a team that should be eliminated because of a funny look. Another team is trying to avoid it.
=
2NE1 was really overwhelmed .. Arrangement is not so different, but the first introduction gesture Geumbokman unique voice did not follow ..
=
Lovelyz would have been sixth if there was no withdrawal.
The sixth place in the world really meant that children had to change their teeth and fall short of expectations.
And everyone enjoys doing so much, and that's what you need to ensure real anonymity
=
Ah why self-assessment ...?; It's sixth place. It's not like the kids. There are many teams that are worse than the children, but it's the youngest team.
=
I couldn't even think that the stage where Sujin performed such facial expressions was under any group.
=
On this day, the Queen and the group of children also did not know the program, but I did not know the program of course, but I thought the children would be the first .. It is better than the original song with my boyfriend .. So Yeon really plays well. He praised him as a celestial celebrity. ?? !! Eva ...
=
I'm the number one ... I didn't know the children until I saw this.
Did you turn it around?
=
Honestly, this song is actually the identity of 2NE1, so it fits less than the original song, but what I feel in this stage is that the respect, the respec, the stage gesture, etc. The conclusion is that no matter how many the original songs are, the stage is not the sixth place.
=
Know if you're embarrassed. You've got to be the top player on YouTube.
=
I think I've made use of the feeling of 2NE1 best among the existing girl groups, but I also want to save their colors and not to lose the feeling of 2NE1.
=
While each member's features are preserved, the stage is just as well as the stage.
=
Why the stage is not sixth
Not only the audience but also other idols
# 1 YouTube views
Recognized by the Three-Song Song (Park Bom wants to record and show it to Dara)
4 Sujin facial acting art
5 arrangements and atmosphere are the best
=
I can't think of the other kids' stages, but I want to see them again.
=
This is the sixth place So-yeon sharpens her sword
=
Give cubes and amnets to your children.
=
I think I'm the best at children, but it's the sixth place ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ 1161 million times ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I don't understand I got the 3 votes below
If it is dishonor or not;
I prepared hard and performed well, but I can't get off to other teams.
=
So Yeon is a real professional
But everyone is so good
=
Is this stage number one, but sixth place?
=
Everyone is really good at it.
=
Woo-gi and Su-jin are so conspicuous.
Soyeon is especially crazy. Pewdu was too small. It was too small water.
=
The girls are really attractive members ... So Yeon is a genius.
=
Did you get this vote? It's really ridiculous .. Every member has a unique personality. The whole stage is new and exciting. The stage itself was so fun. Why?
=
So Yeon-eo-eo-eo is really ... My katoksaek wallpapers are everything. I love you.
=
I don't know why it's the last.
=
It may be useless backstage, but I hope children don't dwell on the 2 votes below.
=
The kids have no performances and no skills ... but I'm good at this.
=
The real kids are really good at Minny, so this time they're getting so bad. We are always cheering.
=
This song has more views than other songs .. ㅎㅎ
K-pop ㅎㅎㅎ
=
The sixth place is the first place even if it comes a week later ....
=
How is this last?
=
Minnie is really a scam
=
3:42 From now on, the atmosphere of the song is definitely jungle.
It's a deliberate analogy to the original song. I really don't know why this stage is below Lovelyz
=
Why is this haha
=
1:58 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Wow, I've got to die. Sisters chew on the stage. Really come back and take my bank account
=
Why is this haha
=
The member combination is really good. I can see members who have different charms and look a bit silly.
=
Fire would have been the first song
=
I put in my own colors and arranged the memories so well
=
Oh, I'm going crazy because I keep studying for the exam.
=
Fire is really awesome, but children seem to express well according to their color.
=
Applause proves live
=
All are good songs, but Shu's voice is good.
=
Seo Soo Jin Part 0:54
1:14
2:34
3:55 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Because of this, I will come to see you tomorrow.
=
4:04 Millionth look back
=
Sujin is a part of the dive in less than 5 seconds.
=
These are so many views
=
You've been hit
=
How many times do you have a seat?
=
Last time I was too good to be alert ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I'm a bit of a credible ... Let's not be disappointed, don't die.
=
But the vocals are a bit weak
It's too dark because it's so dark
Then there are many people who said that they couldn't be better, but the order of the contest can't be ignored.
The only thing the real kids didn't do on this stage was that they had a good first contest.
=
Jeon So-yeon wasn't picked up since the time of the production, but if you look at the stage, you know how to make it taste like a friend.
Of course I like Aizu one but
=
Wow what? I've been reading this idol. What's your name? It's crazy, it's almost CL ㄷ ㄷ ㄷ ㄷ
=
I can't say the sixth place. I thought it would be a lot of votes because it was a true two-one song.
=
The real quantum crew teachers ... can't you get rid of the dropout ... I can't lose anyone's stage here ... I'll try hard to get rid of the dropout
=
I really love you
I come in six times every day
=
Look at the number of views.
=
Look, you're manipulating the produce. You've dropped all of your goodies. I was sixth if I couldn't change the exclamation mark
=
Honestly, I like the original song so much that no one can follow it, but it's not like children. Why is this so incomparable with Lovelyz? I'm not watching Mnet.
=
No, I don't know why it's sixth ... Why am I so cool?
=
Whenever I hear * Wal Kpop Mnet * after the video, Kpop? Kpop? Kay Pahab!?!? Oh, why are you sixth? LOL
=
3:58 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ 앜 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Eoi Hyejung I don't know well but I'm not sure how to do it 셬 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Sujin is like a tribal queen dancing to hold herself in a real jungle
=
3:55 Suzy
=
Miyeon Part Miyeon is better at it.
=
4:00 I have to have such a clip ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Whenever Sujin comes out, a man who is mischievous (?) Laughs John 낰 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I agree
=
I wasn't sixth, but how shocked I was after sixth?
=
Really Arranged Jeon So Yeon Genius Children Cheer up !!!
=
Wow, if you do this, you're not so good?
=
So Yeon Rap .. I saw Unpretty again because of this. And Sujin's 3 seconds of poison. Because of you, I wrapped it while watching Señorita. I went to me .. Hey guys. I'll give it to you ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
They understand one concept and kill one ... Even if the concept is different for each song, it's digested ㅋㅋㅋ This is the youngest group.
=
Minnie is so pretty at the end ...
=
What's over 11 million views ?? Isn't that how good the stage was?
Why is it sixth?
=
2:09 Sounds jumbled during the rainy season
=
(Comment: I don't know why it was 6th place)
=
The sixth place is a real story,
=
Do you get money from Mnet Lovelyz?
=
How is this 6th? I'm not 6th even if I wash my eyes. There's something like 6th place. What sounds like 6th? Absolutely not.
=
Wow .. I can only see Sujin .. ㅠㅠ Look, dance, gestures, everything is sexy. Hyuna feels ;;
=
Hits this is crazy
You have to play it.
=
Are they sixth place?
Personally, I think it's better than Paab. I can't forget this after seeing Real.
=
3:05 ... and half of the Letzgos ..
=
Jeon So-yeon dances
=
So-yeon's combination of cold color and cool soo-yeon's and hot-colored sensual soo-jin's
=
What would I do best if I did this
=
No matter how good the other group is, how is this 6th place ... not 6th place ... ㅋㅋ Who is going to be 6th place is 4th place ... Park Bom is 5th place.
=
3:55 3:55
3:55 3:55 ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠㅜ
=
Is that stage last?
I'm trying to stop you from being pretty
I don't like dogs.
=
The children are good at it, but the song itself is really good but it's been a long time since I like it so I keep watching it
=
Good sound
=
Before Soyeon was born, when my mother asked if my child was a daughter or a son, the doctor would be an idol.
=
At the end of Minni's always like today I'm free
=
Why is this sixth place? Sixth place is sixth place.
=
Hits are marching here
=
No matter how much compared, but not sixth. This time, except for Saxony, I was thinking of the third and fourth place, but sixth .. And the children are not cubes but Jeon So-yeon.
=
I was good at arranging concept costumes.
=
Everyone is so good, but Mi-yeon's face is always the same ...
=
I think 123 in the team are children, Mamamu, AOA
=
Sujin looks like a snake, not a nine tail fox.
=
How can this be bad for a sensation?
=
Cubes are so dense that they are always beaten .... but I can't shoot .... If you like idols belonging to cubes, this is all too sad.
=
Jeon So Yeon ㅇ This is the talent of the devil.
=
What should I really say? The concept is so digested, but most of all, the expression is so creepy. It's creepy ... Soyeon's first start After the rap, it's creepy when the screen is caught. It looks like ...
=
I'm excited about these songs.
=
Now, if the second year's group had such a complete cover, they'd be able to hear monster rookies.
=
If the Lovelyz stage is a bullet bullet, the children stage is a nuclear bullet. Why is this the sixth place?
What's missing?
=
Sujin is cool
=
children
Eoe
Omaruma
Park Bom
Mamamu
Breaking
This fits the ranking ..
=
Jeon So-yeon's make-up is experimental .. This makeup is so pretty that the makeup goes well.
=
Miyeon wants to be more natural to the rhythm ㅠㅠ seems to be in a hurry to miss choreography
=
Isn't he in the CL Hello Beach video?
=
2NE1 showed me at that time.
=
Jeon So-yeon is now a genius, and it hurts ... since I wanted to fire, this feeling was in my head ;; Perfectly reinterpreted in children's style without harming the original
Of course, 2NE1's individual members' ability is so great that the stage may not be abundant, but the arrangement of members is good and it's just a genius.
=
It was said that it wasn't the sixth place, but even if the original song is thin, the children have kept their original color and kept it well.
=
This song is not the sixth reason: Park Bom wants to record and show it to Dara. Originally recognized as a singer.
=
I really don't understand fire I think it's really great to have done this, but are these sixth? I think so
=
It's really awesome. It's too strong for 2NE1 tones, so the children sing, but I keep hearing 2NEONE.
=
If they total 6th place, I don't think .. 2NE1 is an overkill, but it was not the 6th place.
=
I'm a rookie, but it's really amazing The girls are so cool ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
I'm more suspicious of being voted down.
Get more girls
=
You did so well? No it's a bit disappointing. It's a bit embarrassing to see you pulled down a lot;
=
Honestly, the original song is so famous and legendary that it is difficult for children to digest. However, there were only children who could play this song among the queen performers.
=
This is a cover for children 2 Anyone.
From producing ability to coordination, I think it fits so well that the original song is engraved on everybody's mind.
I think it's more meaningful to go there.
It is clear that other groups and audiences watching the stage are not the sixth stage, but the voting method and the year have to be disadvantaged for young children.
However, this time, as a bulletin board story about children's activities in the US, I think that the group that has accumulated solid experience since debut is a good place to go higher.
=
Hey guys, it's not strange to see cancer alone. I think other teams are going to fall into Lovelyz, so I feel like I'm the last one to be a scapegoat for children.
=
I'm going to be the number one hit really goodbye to go crazy creepy woman .. ,,. Sujinwoo's facial expressions and lip finish at the end of Soyeon's smile and creepy smile.
=
Miyeon: In action
Sujin, Shuhwa: Immediately after the demonstration
Rainy season: drinking after a broken heart
So-yeon: My ex-boyfriend
Minni: Waiting for the police
=
Minnie That lively and blurry eye looks like crazy, so it 's more amazing.
=
How long will you push a popular, familiar, and accelerated song to the idol group ... Once you hear it and never leave your head, the more you hear, the deeper it gets. The performance arrangements are completely superb ... Do not force the idols to use familiar songs that are easy to understand and listen to, but let the listeners widen their ears and eyes, and escape from the girls.
=
The kids don't have a clear stage like where they've seen them. So far, the concepts are .. I think this is really smart if Soyeon intended. Korean girl group concept There's been a long time there and there are a lot of groups that repeat safely .. Even the 1st group doesn't .. But the children are definitely different. Real children should be proud.
=
That comment was funny but where did it go? ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
All the other members were resigned, angry, and sad, but Minnie was already killing and waiting for the police.
=
Yes, this is the parting song. This is the real parting feeling,
=
Don't do this, give me real Queendom 2.
=
Minni seems to have her eyes killed and no emotion
=
First of all, I'm afraid that I'm going to do this stage again because I'm afraid that I won 4th place with this perforator. I really want to see this stage again.
=
ㅋㅋㅋ No number of days
=
Jeon So-yeon's real transformation is how he dares to give up his popularity in the comeback war and save his children's musicality. Like the age of I-pop, not pop
I don't feel like it's too hot and I don't feel buried because it's so popular and I don't feel like Ryan but it's better to say no.
It's a good response, of course, but maybe after a while, more people will know my song and be reevaluated.
=
No, where's the comment? Who saw the rainy season and left it in the park?
=
This is ㄹㅇ farewell song ... usually farewell songs
All the same
"Now I'll send you ~ Hmm hmm ~"
This is unrealistic.
=
When I first saw the children's stage, I thought that Soyeon was great, but the members who digested it as they wanted while watching the Queendom really look great. When I saw Sujin's eyes, I think I would drop a drop of tears. The rest of the members were acting as well. Do you have to look for a personal cam just like a producer? I hope children keep doing this stage a lot. Performances, songs, expressions, acting are all perfect.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius. But if other members can't express it on stage, it's a steal, and this group member has all the ability to express it 200%. A group that makes you feel proud and proud of kpop. Full praise!
=
1:28 I'm only afraid of Shuhua. Like a real mannequin, a mannequin is moving.
=
I am so proud that each of the real children's members is represented as a card that Soyeon uses for stage production.
It's really creepy to present a card that can stand for each concept, and that it is said to be the weapon that makes the stage alive.
=
I think it's the first time I've had such excellent stage control and composition as girls.
So-yeon ... Hey ... Sujin -... Smokey ... Minnie personally sounds so good that he comes out solo ...
=
This is why girls and girls are doing it.
=
I'm going to see this stage periodically. It's really crazy. I'm just crazy from acting out facial expressions to planning and starting. Jeon So-yeon is a real genius.
=
Groups that are more crushing because they don't want to look pretty
=
4:06 You're looking at the camera side by side, but looking at the front camera is very attractive.
=
2:25 Sujin's "I hate it" was really creepy and very well expressed. My eyes are loose, my madness is full of hatred, and my hands that erase my trembling lips are so good at expressing me.
=
Wow, it looks like Minnie is a legend
=
Sujin's lip and trembling her lips in the middle
=
The more I look at it, the more I feel crazy about it, the more I feel sad, the more my love becomes obsessed, and I don't see the madness. The feeling of self-esteem has changed to the extreme, and the crimes of various loves are thought to be creepy and scary, and they are sad again because they loved the other so much. Is it love or crime? At first it was like love, then it was like a crime in the middle, and then it was like an obsession that fell down. Confusing. Really great kids ...
=
It's just that girls are born to Bontobe girls ... They were born as if they were girls from birth.
=
It's a waste to use the expression that I went to this stage. The whole gum is like a stage to decorate ... Really amazing ... I was really shocked at the sixth place, I knew a great stage this time, but I did not know that this stage would be a children's legend video.
=
This stage has Sujin's prominence, but Min-na's tone sounds so good with the song.
=
Horror + crazy love atmosphere Did not express too well ..... So Yeon's crazy madness and Sujin are crying while brushing her lips in the middle.
=
It's a charm that attracts foreigners even if they're overseas. Is it a complimentary Korean singer girl?
=
I don't understand if it's not the top one, is the stage voting because it doesn't express that expression or gesture well?
=
Like the old idols, these idols were not a variety of concepts, but they were sad.
=
It's creepy even if you keep looking at it. Suddenly, it's really awesome. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ To remove lipstick is not erased from my memory.
=
The stage where children's facial expressions were hit by the drama ......... Composition Soyeon Lyrics Soyeon Arrangement Soyeon ㄹㅇ Cleared by Jeon Soyeon
=
Really perfect ... No point 1 Unfortunately, I was so good. I wasn't really good at the fourth place. I was crazy. , Betrayal ...... just mixed up ..... ㅠㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ
=
Oh really ..... I wish girls to go for a long time I can not consider the image of the public, but I hope to do a lot of experimental stages in the future! I think only girls can do this
=
I feel like I've seen this amazing musical
=
Me: Oh, I have to study now
YouTube: Want to see the stage once more
=
The kids are gel stage geniuses
=
It's so imagining that a woman who can't break up and bear the weight of that sadness is as cool as it was. It's so cool.
=
It's not like watching an idol stage, but a real musical
=
Every time Minny gets caught, it's a real hit ... It looks like it's just expressionless, but it's scary and scary after he's already killed him.
=
The biggest attraction of children is that they naturally express their facial expressions according to the song concept.
=
Goose bumps all the time .... each one expresses the same feelings, feeling a little different seems to be more surprised, especially Sujin .... I always do really good whenever I see
=
4:47 Jeon So-yeon's true story ...? It's one of the songs that I hoped you didn't want to, but what's your name ...
(3:05 Oh My Girl Mimi is surprised to see the best) (I'm Miracle ...))
=
I'm so good at it. It's a performance that erases the sensibility of lipstick. The members are so expressive.
=
How do you turn ballads into dances and do horror versions?
=
It was so creepy that I really want to be creepy when I wash her lipstick.
=
When I remove Sujin lipstick, my facial expression is real.
2:30
=
Wow ... Sujin's bar is opened ... and Minnie's hands are blinding
The first part is Wow ... this concept is Minnie ... crazy .. So Yeon was crazy at the end of his laughter ...
=
These guys are really good at stages
=
The real girls are girls who can only do girls.
=
It's creepy to wear only one ring on the ring finger of the former member's left hand without any other accessories. I squeezed my lips while expressing my lipstick.
=
Queendom advent idols aren't fans, but real kids are amazing
Every stage, I'm not immersive
=
I feel like I'm expressing a woman who is obsessed with a man because his love has changed.
=
I think girls are a big company artist who promotes and works well. Tops seemed to have taken a shot. The cubes don't work so hard.
=
Sujin is crazy about a woman who is obsessed with something ..
So Yeon is so scared. Whenever I do this, I feel like I'm going to kill him.
And Shuhwa seems to have broken his own frame on this stage.
=
I haven't heard since I've seen this stage.
=
But even if you look at it, it seems like you were afraid of concept because of concept in fire.
=
Even if you don't win, everyone knows what they did best
=
Everybody is tired these days
This is really boring ...
Later, if they have a boyfriend, he's already dead.
=
I'm crazy. This is crazy. Every member is acting or interpreting crazy? Sujin sees a little tear in her eyes
=
Children really need to leave.
=
I've been watching about 20 times
Oh! Police line at the intro (00:12) ...
"YOU DARE", not "KEEP OUT"
Was it? And even one detail
I'm creepy in my role ...
It was a great stage
=
Oh, I'm really looking forward to the year-end stage.
=
It was surprisingly scary and impressive that the existing idols were able to show this mad stage.
=
The biggest beneficiaries of Queendom It's so nice to see a lot of people really appreciate their children as Queendom.
Come on, these real kids should leave
=
Why is this the fourth place?
=
Personally, I felt that the real rainy season and Minnie Soyeon's facial expressions are enormous. ㄹㅇ ...
=
The real kids are all crazy and the Johnna dog is cool, but the dog.
=
Minnie's eyes are dreamy, hazy and decadent ...
=
Song Title: Amnet, Say You'll Last
Title of song: hey Mnet tell me Im the bottom again
My poor poem that Mnet hides
Amnet, how is this fourth ?;
=
All six acting performances were so good. Really good stage. Real children. Please stay to the end of Queendom.
=
A class contest where children take a thriller.
=
The real stage production and the kids' expressions are all good, but it's better to feel like crying when So-yeon raps (?) It was better just to make children cool and creepy.
=
Jeon So-yeon, I don't think it's crazy What's so crazy?
=
If you look closely, the rainy season's eyes are paired ...
=
I almost see it every week, I keep thinking
The members acted on their faces
=
I told you to say 'no, don't love me'
If you can say it once, tell me ... If you hear it from your loved one,
=
Every time I see children, it's like a creepy brawl.
=
Honestly, it is natural that Soyeon produced is a genius, but the members who digested it in the direction that Soyeon thought was a genius are also geniuses. ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Minnie is a real Tommy material .....
=
Are you crazy? No Jeon So-yeon? It's really crazy. Are you crazy? Is it really crazy?
=
2:47 When I erase Sujin lipstick, my thoughts are erased.
=
No, I've seen this a few dozen times and I knew it was the first time a back dancer was dragging 3:01
=
I wanted to finish the game after watching it
=
Minny Limbo will do well.
It's a pain, but my waist is just over
1:58
=
3:05 Oh, it's really a mimi look. It's funny every time I see you.
=
Rainy Minnie Soyeon Sujin It's really exciting to have a pair of eyes or blurry eyes when the screen is caught.
=
This concept itself is a complete adventure. If you digest it like this ... I love you ... I'm a genius, so don't be foolish.
=
Quantum's all-time stage is born
=
Hey, let's turn this over 1000 !!
=
It's a rookie stage that hasn't been debuted for less than two years .... I don't really mean it ..... I heard that I didn't like it. How can I arrange this? ..Oh my
=
03:05 Thank you!
=
I think this program was just made for children .... The talent of children is so great.
=
It's the first time I'm creepy on stage
=
Everyone ringed on the fourth finger of their left hand .... Detail crazy.
=
Minni was born to be an idol
=
Girls, let's go abroad right now.
=
I'm not a fan of the kids, but I remember shocking and tears at home.
In terms of artists, children are genius
=
I was so good at the stage that this song was so sad. Charm True Star
=
You guys are really good at acting.
=
I thought Jeon So-yeon was a song and dance rap producer, so I thought I was Jeon So-yeon and children. Lol
=
4:08 Eye smoke is so good
=
The most impressive stage of the Queendom stage.
=
I've rarely seen female idols stage this concept, but I'm really excited about it, so I can't pick one.
=
At the end, it is a creepy laugh that staggers in the end ... It was an ending that perfectly fits the theme of bizarreness.
=
It's really bad but why aren't you over 10 million
=
It's amazing.
=
One moment on stage is a legend, but from the beginning, the scene where a male dancer falls with a sound effect and gets a red pin light is already another level.
=
Wow ... I've never seen a creepy stage, but at home I'm creepy .. ㄷㄷㄷ Real girls are wow .......
=
1:25 Minnie gets dark and the heart is bruised: three hundred
1:50 Shuhwa will take me away: it's better to frown
2:10 Favorite group choreography part: foot movement
2:31 Sujin lipstick 1: Tell me what you don't want to do
2:42 Soojin Lipstick 2: Slippery front hand gestures too ...
3:38 The rainy season starts with a cold season: one eye is good to see
3:59 Will it end this way: How dare you leave me? Feeling
4:05 Minnie gets darker and my heart bruises2
=
I hope the day will come as soon as the day that children can rise to the top girl group and realize all arrangements and concepts in Jeon So-yeon's head.
=
Of all the stages I've seen in Queendom, I personally think it was the most shocking and creepy stage, especially Minnie Acting
=
I was tired from the rainy season
=
3:17 Hmm, why are you sitting like that ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Oh, I don't want to see other contestants
Ah responsible
=
Wow, I've seen you in my heart.
=
Wasn't it awesome? ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Sujin's face acting Isn't it crazy? The real concept is children ... Unique concept ;; Horror Specialist
=
4:06 At this point, I think I'm watching a close-up of a cartoon illustration .. I was surprised ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Even though every child is a legend, it's like Latata and this stage, and Jeon So-yeon in the middle of the rap while crawling on the stage (?) Seems to be more legend ..
=
Very interesting that almost doesn't look like this
=
Really crazy
I can only say that I'm crazy about the rankings .. This stage is a stage where children can see how unique they are than other idols.
=
Selena Gomez equals real 0:53
=
When Sujin erased her lipstick, she felt like she was breathing.
=
The rainy season is a concept with only one eye.
=
The more I look at you, the more beautiful I am
=
Minnie feels like a model?
=
Cube is so good for Soyeon is a treasure of K-pop world ...
=
If you feel anger before killing the other members, Minnie is already dead and empty.
=
I still can't believe it ㅋㅋㅋ Queendom is over and it's ridiculous that this performance is 4th place.
ㅠ
=
The children are really real .. especially when I erase Sujin lipstick in the middle.

End!! It was really hard
Those who do timeline really respect
It seems like it's been an hour, so if you like it, you can see others like this. Please ask once. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Soyeon is a genius who wrote and composed this masterpiece. I felt the madness of a woman who fell in love with her because she loved her so much.
=
Let's go billboard. Idols who are at the top of the list Children are better than anyone.
=
This is so pretty
=
I doubted eyes because it was fourth in the stage and acting and expression.
=
Kids facial expression is awesome
=
It's the first time I've trembling my heart while watching Idol stage. Particularly when I remove Sujin lipstick, I look at the detail of my hand.
=
I was performing and I was doing art
=
Creepy in direction, creepy in content, songwriting arrangements once again, all the creepy, creepy infinite for Halloween season
=
It's like you're going to hate it and you're a guy, so you scream, not the audience's shout ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Minni: I still can't believe you killed a man.
Soyeon: Killing a man is getting mad.
Rainy season: Like a doll to revenge (♥)
Shu: I still don't believe that moment
Miyeon: I'm acting that I didn't die.
Sujin: I am sad because I killed someone I loved
=
This concept I saw all six people ... I was really crazy because the stage composition and Perfor made the song that was not well known ... and Miyeon's face and hairstyle that's really hot ...? You're pretty
=
We write history of girl idol real
=
Even in the first contest Latata, the children are scary and the mad mood seems to go well together.
=
It's really awesome ... I don't have any idols to play this concept in the middle of the game. This is the first class I've seen. This is the performance pack.
=
But I really enjoyed the other groups of Queendom but I think the children are getting the best performance. Jeon So-yeon is a genius.
=
No, we don't have any words. So Yeon tries to sit at the end, looking at the screen, laughing and expressionless.
=
0:39 Screaming Why are you yelling?
=
Minnie and burnout look great ...
=
This concept is totally sad
I didn't think I could arrange this, and I couldn't arrange it like this. Children are really you. I really love, love and love it. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ What is the genius of Jeon So-yeon?
=
3:06 Warhu
=
Totally creepy
I can't take my eyes off the stage. I think it's all crazy.
It is the first time that snow falls.
I am going to be a fan of you today.
=
Poor squash ... Who left you?
=
Children always think that Jeon Soyeon is dragging and dragging, but looking at the Queendom seems to be excellent for each member's individual ability. When Jeon Soyeon comes up with ideas, the rest of the members are doing well.
=
Like the children's real girl group history
=
Su-jin Seo That lipstick erasing scene .. I can practice. How can I really do that?
=
This is a must-see once a week.
=
It is said that Soyeon is influenced by the members when they write the song, but since the members express it so well, it seems that there must be no children at all.
=
Obviously the live feels better than the sound source. So especially the rap part is the sound and the breathing is stable and calm. + Feeling intimidating, but will you leave Live like this already? Tell me if you're going to leave? This feeling...
=
Idol bosses need to lower their children's height. If Soyeon hadn't been composing, she might not have heard that attractive tone of the rainy season. By the way
=
1:44 Rainy season, just one bite up. Wow.
=
This is real Idols usually say goodbye to the pain, but beautiful farewell, but if the loved ones leave, people are broken.
=
How is this fourth? How can you be fourth?
=
Queendom 2 is a second generation girl group or a solo singer.
=
3:59 Mi-yeon looks so good here; I'm hiding
=
No matter how much you think about it, except for children, this concept fits so well and the stage composition is like no one.
=
How many times do I really look at this? I'm never satisfied with the sound.
=
It might be a crazy woman, but I thought someone was thinking about Chucky because it's Halloween. It's also a toy story of cruel fairy tale.
=
03:06 seconds The scariest here
03:22 seconds
=
01:51 Minnie here ...
=
It looks like a deserted shovel.
=
I'm competing.
Come up with work ...
Neither works of art ...
=
I hope the stage will be good for the girls who play musicals !! The choreography and facial expressions are really creepy according to the concept. Especially Minnie and Sujin are amazing !!
=
It's crazy, it's really so good, every face, every gesture, it's amazing .. At first, Soyeon's head hurts, her eyes close and her lips are close to every detail.
It's a different story from a girl group who's flirting with a pink dress and showing love shyness.
=
This is crazy; Eyes and lips when smearing ordinal sticks, last laughs, the first part, the last part, acting like a different person, the rainy season loosened, shrunk the head of the shoe
=
1:44 Laughing Dogs
=
If you show this stage, you can't see Pyu
=
Your agency will be comfortable. Take these kids.
They are all writing songs, arranging compositions, producing and stage concepts.
Please support me
Especially in the long run
=
Su Jin was really born
So-yeon is a genius.
=
3:56 Beauty. What did Mi-yeon save her country from in her previous life?
=
Are you crazy? I'm really Miracle after my dog.
=
3:42 I had a head open fight with my boyfriend ... Look at the head.
=
3:06 Oh my heart is stiff.
=
2:31 I hate it. Smoke is coming ... Performance craftsmen.
=
This is a farewell song.
=
No matter how good Soyeon leads you,
If there were no members, Soyeon couldn't be praised.
=
It's a really refreshing song after the background, but is there a word to express it?
=
Even though I was PD, I can't send you a trailer.
=
I listened to the song and cried
=
The public over there doesn't know the true value of the children.
=
So-yeon said that children are a group that breaks prejudice, but it's not that they're really popular songs for the first place, but it's so cool to be adventurous. TT
=
4:00 I see sheep ..
=
어떻게 It's really great how the stage is planned and put into practice in the real mind.
=
Kingdom = Fandom
=
If you look at it, all the members wear a ring on the ring finger of their left hand. Every detail is like a woman who is betrayed and crazy by a man he really loves.
=
But styling is the best
=
Even if you say no, nightmare version video
=
Crazy madness, anger, and sorrow like a broken doll was a strange and creepy piece of art that was combined with modern dance, and it was an artistic stage with excellent expression and passion.
=
It's all Johnny, but Minnie is my style.
=
2:31 I keep coming in to see this.
=
Wow, it's not a joke that you've entered the name of the song that you composed.
=
I liked the stage so much that I came to watch the broadcast, but it broke more than 3:06 seconds lol.
=
At this time the makeup is really awesome !!!
Everyone looks good!
=
Minnie is so good on this stage.
=
It's the best on stage.
=
I've been watching Minnie all the time, but every time I see you, I'm laughing at the end .. I'm scared of laughing. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow, it's really a good idea to get all the cube board members up and clap their standings and put the red carpet on the way back. I really overwhelm everything.
=
Jeon So-yeon is great, but I think it's the children's power to express it and match it together. Messi has a great performance in Barcelona. Even if there is a genius that Argentina can't use the Mac, somebody around him should support it. No rice ...
=
This is the original song composition song Soyeon and arrangement Soyeoni did .. Self-producing girl group children are really cool and wish you well!
=
I like how this isn't even scary and all the girls are freaking out it's so dumb (eyes) but it was a good preference
=
4:00 Minnie and Sujin were too hard to see, but they're really pretty.
=
1:43 I'm just seeing you wet in the rainy season. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow everyone acting too much at the level
=
I became a Neverland after seeing this ... Only Otakuro Toudi was violently violated.
=
1:44 Ugnie is a big smile.,
=
ㅋㅋㅋ No I'm looking for the tenth time really ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ 핳 I love it so much
=
I love facial expressions and resent the madness caused by farewell? I think it's a crazy process because it seems to be going crazy. Above all, I don't care how my hair gets messed up and how lipstick is smeared. You have prepared a knife.
=
1:43 Look at the laughter.
=
Sujin acts so well on the broken woman who feels like crying.
=
This is true art.
After a decade of forgetting 'break up pain of farewell'
As you pass by, you will feel it again with the performance of this idol group.
Cube's planning power was brilliant and all the children were excellent performers and artists.
It doesn't matter if they're subordinate or how high they are in Queendom.
For K-POP fans around the world who saw the Queendom,
You'll be imprinted into a great and talented group.
Cube would have been looking for it.
=
This stage was creepy while watching the real thing ... as if to express the creepy theme of anger in sadness. This Halloween is dominated by children
=
3:06 Oh, it's crazy.
=
2:31 Sujin facial acting ..
=
This stage is even more amazing, but the concept is also a concept, but every member has a memorable point ... Soyeon Sujin Minni I don't really have to say this time. All legends have been taken to the gallery.
=
How is Minnie expressing her empty eyes?
=
This is the first time I haven't anticipated this while watching the stage ..... I'm completely nervous because I don't expect to see how each scene will come out next time .... ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The children have become proper names. Whatever you do, I remember you as a good group
=
Jeon So Yeon Rap part is so creepy
And I saw Sujin tremble when I erased lipstick. I'm done. My life is children.
=
2:31 It was ..
=
3:40 The rainy season I don't know if one side of the eye is a little straight, but I really like it.
=
3:05 LOL blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
=
The most intense scene is Sujin's lipstick scene, but Minnie's dreamlike eyes are not erased from memory.
=
2:28 I'm crazy. I really like you. I love you.
=
1:25 4:06 Minnie's eyes are absent ;;
=
In my heart you're the first place ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I guess these guys are all crazy I'm so crazy
=
The performance is so good
Song is so good
=
Jin-Jin's kids are crazy. I like dogs.
=
No, it's really like a musical acting like a musical song .. No, it's a farewell and a broken self expression. Especially, I'm shocked to remove my hand and eyes. Become a group ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's an addiction. I'm not a fan. I watch it three times a day.
=
3:06 New Gunya ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Shiba ㅠㅠㅠ TT TT concentration concentrated laughter ㅠ ㅠ TT TT TT TT TT 옼 ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ
=
Sujin was scared of removing lipstick and Soyeon rap ......
=
When I first saw it, I was shocked and scared.
=
2:31 Sujin Legend ...
=
1:44 Woogie's look is really crazy.
=
I'm worried that this concept won't work so I'm worried that children won't try this strange thing in the future. I didn't look too negative and kept expressing my creativity.
=
Sujin's Part
Killing loved ones
With the witness who saw it
Eye contact
I woke up
I feel like I'm shaking.
=
But this really creepy doesn't even have English 1
=
Wow, but the expressions are all good as one. If you can't choreograph or have too much or too little facial expressions on this stage, it would be strange.
=
Wow, I'm crazy. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅇ Mimi expression is funny.
=
Aren't you really crazy ????? It was so good at all levels regardless of the real rankings. Really ... And not to mention Sujin and Soyeon, Minnie, Woogi and Miyeon and Shuhwa ... I couldn't get together at all. I couldn't get mad at the crazy madness and gestures. He was so good. Especially, the rainy season was cute and vivid, so I couldn't imagine this ... I was surprised because I was so good .. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Creepy sprout ;;;
=
2:31 "It's disgusting" Look at Sujin ㅠㅠㅠ TT That's so sexy and decadent + You can be pretty.
=
When you removed Sujin lipstick, your editor really did a great job ...
=
When I give it the impact at first, I feel a lot of sagging, but when I remove the Sujin lipstick, I shine with my eyes Jeon Soyeon rap Minny's eyes last Jeon Yeon, I sit down and change my face.
=
Wow, this is not a transformation, but just evolving. I don't think of any other girl girl group to digest this concept.
=
3:51 Are you a true story? ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It is not possible to create such a stage with its own production, even if it is not a rookie title. It is impossible to be a genius.
=
3:06 I'm so scared of this
=
I'm here to see Sujin tell me that he's awkward. I'm going to be in the rainy season.
=
Soyeon 4:47 Look ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㄷㄷ Pendulum
=
3:21 Mimi reaction craftsman
=
Let's talk about the rainy season. One eye grimacing. I feel so good at expressing emotions.
=
3:44 When everything breaks down, choreography breaks down in their own way. It's really crazy.
=
Borderline Personality Disorder
=
Oh Mimi Oh ~~ It's funny.
=
So we saw a musical starring six women?
=
Wow ... I thought it was just a good and good group for girls, but this stage was so crazy. I don't care about idols and I found old songs all the time.
=
2:39 I'm sorry
Horror movie
It's too dark to see
I'm the one who didn't understand it. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Shu is really scary
=
Sujin can't really wake up with Snow White.
=
Wow!
=
3:06 I'm surprised.
=
I was surprised when I saw him.
This stage can't breathe ... It doesn't make sense ... Wow ... It's ridiculous that it's only going to be an idol for the second year ... Really great ...
The rankings may not be good because of the special examination, but really ... more people should watch this stage.
=
This is really good acting story voice
=
No. The last Jeon So-yeon expression .. When I lost focus and moved from a slightly mad pupil to a laugh with madness, it was really creepy ... I think it was the best stage I've ever seen in my life.
=
6th place was a shock, not a tooth, but a change of gum;
=
It's a legend every day
Minnie .. I love this time. ♡♡♡
=
Really crazy ........
=
It's so creepy that the feelings are different
So Yeon-Man Leas and Gets Angry
Rainy season-weeping
Sujin-committing work, confused and embarrassed
Minni-Already kill a man
Mi-yeon-Trying to forget alone
Shu-hwa-let go of yourself
=
It's a virtue ...
=
Soyeon Rappart is crazy ....
=
This song is addictive and the atmosphere and quality are much better than the others.
=
How many times I've turned it around. Real geniuses are creepy, but the finger ring ring is dark and the barrigate is invisible and dark.
=
What a bad expression, not Psycho? Oh really? ㅇㅇ
=
3:07 Stripper
=
Minni three hundred is likewise used; Real concept faithful crazy
=
There seems to be a genre of children now;
=
When I rap Jeon Soon, dict is good and I didn't hear the lyrics, but I hear everything !!
=
I couldn't hear it once, so I kept looking at it ㅠㅠ Whenever I came out of the scene to remove the children's lipstick, I hit my forehead and it was as if the turtle was washed.
=
shuhua is so amazing! very good
=
It's over and the rainy season is reversed.
=
Mi-yeon and Shu-hwa are still affectionate in their eyes and if they have a sad look at me when they leave me in the rainy season And Sujin is sad even though it's cold
=
Every time you do something bizarre, you scream, wow 웃 ㅇ ㅇㅋㅇㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋㅋ
=
Don't forget to be fooled by a lion and say no.
=
Only me in the rainy season 3:40
=
Sujin: Break up with your lover
Rainy Season: Keep Hanging on Lovers
Shuhwa, Miyeon: Between sorrow and anger
So-yeon: Killing Lovers
Minni: I'm already killing a man
=
Seosujin look crazy. My face muscles trembling when I really cry
=
Children are the future
=
It was the best stage among idols for Halloween concept or horror concept. Feeling of seeing one musical. It's really cool to have a song written by Jeon So-yeon at the beginning, and the stage composition, costumes, and children's facial expressions. It's really shocking
=
I can't take my eyes off
Real song performance, all your voices are great.
Really the best !!!!!!
=
Miyeon's tone is good but the gesture is limited.
=
If you watch the stages in the Queendom, the songs, stages, or concepts are really unique from the time of Latata .. It seems like only children can do it.
=
This song is the first time I listened to the expressions and emotions. The song itself is also good. I wanted this to be possible
=
Introductory work. How is this lower right
=
I think I'm going to work once a day
=
Expression acting wow ...
=
It looks like you're really crying when Sujin removes the lipstick.
=
I'll spend money so I keep doing this
=
It was all good, but what about the others
It's really creepy that Sujin is crying in the middle .. (´ ༎ ຶ Д༎ ຶ `) Nothing looks good on the children. (ू˃̣̣̣̣̣̣︿˂̣̣̣̣̣̣̣ ू)
=
1:43 Is this just scary for me?
The rainy season that comes out of dreams: it's scarier than pennywise
=
I think all the ghosts that are likely to be from all over the world are so united. I love you
=
And my facial expression continues from time to time (0o0) This state ㄷ ㄷㄷㄷ
=
Mnet always lit something else during the stage;
Let's just keep on stage ...
=
Honestly, I don't know how well the remaining teams will do, but I'm afraid they're the best.
=
Really crazy ... no way
=
3:06 The real dog surprise. 3:11 The second.
=
I don't know anything else, and I composed a song, arranged, and arranged.
=
3:07 ... Are you surprised?
=
This is not an exaggeration to say that the facial expression is exhausted
=
Shu Hwa's facial exercises are more natural and intense
=
Wow, someone said that it was a poison addict because it was the last on the stage after the fire comment. I helped
=
The scene that removes lipstick remains a length legend.
Only children can think
Only children can digest
Sujin's expression of emotion there .. I think it's over.
=
Wow, I've never seen a real Queendom, but I've seen this by accident. Really like the world.
=
Minni and Seo Sujin Three hundred eyes are fascinating ㅠㅠ In a dark concept like that makes the atmosphere much more
=
Believe it or not, you're a rookie.
=
I don't care about the rankings. I would like to have a high ranking, but because it is a stage that can be mixed up, I want to give first place in my mind just because I did this stage.
=
Minnie is really pretty.
=
Wow, you're so pretty.
=
It's more like a screaming sound than a shout in the stands, which makes the stage feel better.
=
This is art?
=
All-time Siksen Paap-Boda hurriedly with anti-horsepower
=
No. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ： 3: 05 Only me funny ??
=
Sujin is a real betrayal and a crazy woman.
=
1:24
4:06 I left it because I wanted to find you.
=
This song was made by So Yeon ...? I think it's really sad
=
Do you see the lip fluttering at 2:34 and get water first? I'm ... I'm creepy ...
=
The real cube is bowed down to Jeon So-yeon .. In the early days of the children, I came out with a lot of expressions, but now ... Minnie's face is really Wow ... Wow ... Not to mention Miyeonido ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Seems to develop as the day progresses, so amazing and now seems to be no further development, but break through the limits every time
=
Actor with 6.63 Million Views ...
Suh Sujin's lips are better than other people
Sister .. No Sister I Love Both Lips .. ❤❤
=
ㅎ No why is this fourth ???
=
Can I express “I hate you” more than me properly?
=
It's just art It's amazing how you can express so many emotions in less than 5 minutes
=
I'm creepy
Not to mention Su-jin, Min-ni has a hard time expressing her expression, and the rainy season has only half her eyes.
=
Miyeon's Jeon So-yeon's facial acting
=
4:00 Honorable
=
Everyone is so pretty.
=
I would like to do what I did
=
Yew was upset when her performance wasn't flipped forward at the same time in another video, but I was very creepy because I felt something more distracting. !! Good job Yew! Well done! Children ~!
=
I was going to write a comment for the legend part, but this is all legendary
=
Minnie's dreamlike look and Sujin's dance line are so creepy
=
I thought I was screaming at the beginning when the man leaned in and turned on the red light.
=
1:39 I'm ticking, but it doesn't hurt ..
=
I think the biggest beneficiaries of real Queendom are girls. You're so good.
=
Unexperienced
Sujin Suehwa is in a row after the demonstration
After the rainy season demonstration, my lover George
Minnie Joe is waiting for the police.
=
That #Miyeon tho ~
=
Wow, it's crazy ... Soyeon's madness, Sujin's trembling lips, her crying look, her wet one-eyed expression and Minnie's waist bending .... especially in her head ... It looks like Sujin and Minnie are really showing something in Queendom. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
For K-pop idols so far, makeup was just "receiving" and this stage made it "a stage that can be used."
=
I watch this video only a few times a day and every time I see it, I'm new
=
I think it's a bit of madness, but I'm really good. I'm really good at acting like psycho. Idol girl I usually touch my face.
=
The game has already ended since the songwriting / composition / arrangement
=
Before I erase the lipstick, I feel like it's a reality
=
2:41 Yuji is just greedy.
=
Composed, wrote, arranged Soyeon ... Cube should thank Soyeon a hundred times a thousand times and give her money straight.
Stand and find
=
It's like seeing a real stage.
=
This is a real generation, Queendom All the stage was the most shocking and so good at all.
=
Wow
=
3rd Contest Overwhelming Hits Difference
The second highest number of views is less than 2 million
True Queendom is children
=
A little scary but intense.
=
Sujin seems to be betrayed by a real crazy woman.
=
If you're a girl group, there's a lot of cutie sexy talents, but it's the best formula for girls. It's like the stage gets people to concentrate
=
No, it's funny, you can't see the stage when you're playing with Sujin. You can't see the stage. You have to focus on other stage performances. The evaluation is fair and it's polite to listen to other stages.
=
It's really creepy. It's so scary
=
When I erase the lipstick, I've seen Sujin's eyes and lip fluttering
=
I feel creepy, weak and loved ones who went to the other side .... Shu Hwa I'm so good at this time.
=
It's crazy and creepy
=
4:06 with
=
When I was a producer, I wanted a girly concept and Jeon So-yeon wasn't selected because I didn't think it was the right concept. Nevertheless, Jeon So-yeon had chewed on the stage, so many of the evaluation was good. Of course, this is only based on awareness and popularity. I want you to be more successful, like the one who humiliated you
=
Shiva hair why is this the fourth place
=
Every time I see this stage, I tear up
=
What should I do? I was creepy because it was so cool looking at this stage.
=
3:06 This look is steamed
=
Queendom Best Stage
=
I thought Sujin was really crazy when she erased her lipstick.
=
Even if I'm dressed for Halloween
=
I don't know how many times I see each one.
=
Performance just crazy
=
It's a little bit of a noseline.
=
Did Jeon So-yeon need to be a genius to that extent? It was a stage that made it clear that children couldn't be locked in the frame of the other members.
=
If you have this feeling, you can be a joker.
=
I don't understand why it's sub-order even if I die ;;
Children's stage is a fresh concept not seen in the idol group, and a little bizarre stage + a horrible and dim song atmosphere + Oji stage seismic power + left hand ring ring detail + Soyeon's madness acting, Sujin's facial acting, rainy season One eye like a ghost is a little closed detail, Shu is a beautiful girl who seems to be sick after her lover left, Miyeon's acting look like it's a lover's fault. Minnie who seems to be revenge
I watched this stage, and every second was creepy and the song ended, so I couldn't say anything, didn't think anything, and stayed for 5 seconds ... and I was sorry for the other group because of the fresh shock, but the back stages were normal. Three times a day
Is this fourth? Honestly, I thought it was # 1, of course.
Ha ... I think there's no stage at the scene.
=
3:06 sec Who knows who?
=
One more time before going to bed
=
To be honest, if this concept is foolish,
I'm so good at it that I'm immersed and shrunk;
It feels like a horror movie.
=
No, this is not the 1st place but the 4th place. Ryan and the real girls are so awesome. 37 years old, idol video.
=
Creepy when Minni calls part;
=
There are no holes in the members ... The charms are different. Each one plays his role very well. Shu Hwa's face looks like a Japanese doll and it's creepy ... Minni's three hundred eyes and facial expressions go well with the song.
=
Oh children? haha
=
3:06 3:22
This is someone ㅋㅋ ㅋㅌㅌ ㅌㅋㅋㅋ ㅌㅌㅋㅋ ㅋㅌㅋㅋ ㅋㅌㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Members' left hand ring finger If you look closely, everyone is wearing a ring ... A man who has pledged love enough to give a ring is sad and angry that he no longer loves himself. After all, they're crazy about the conflict and are caught in madness. Sad but creepy
=
Shuhua, love line ...
=
Minni was betrayed and suffered from men.
The rainy season is like a doll the baby played in the attic
=
Min ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
Shu has developed a lot of facial expressions and room really.
=
Minnie and I'm crazy 4:06 Look Already killed a man right me ^
=
Are children real rookies? I'm so good at the stage. I'm really immersed.
=
When I remove Sujin lipstick, my lips tremble
=
It's like Jeon So-yeon Jeon It's very similar to the Joker who's currently released. From facial expressions to acting.
=
With me creepy crazy
=
When Sujin erases her lipstick, her face looks almost crying
=
Once again
=
Only me 3:07 Is this part funny? LOL LOL
=
I feel like I'm the best ever in Queendom ... It's crazy that I'm in a completely different world.
=
On the stage, Mi-yeon's Minnie is very strong Sujin was surprisingly surprised by the lack of force.
=
It's just really crazy from the beginning to the end, all the scenes are killing parts Oh, but despite the introduction of Soyeon, the song tone
=
But the first time that scream was actually screaming How scared it was .. ㄷㄷ ... If you look at the real scene immersion is not a joke ..
=
Tell me you don't like this movie
=
I think there was an idol stage that was so cruel and insanely expressing the common material of love, farewell and obsession ... This is the first time for a real queendom. It's so nice to see it ㅠㅠ Everyone was really good at appearing in the Queendom and Jeon So-yeon is a genius
=
This is not an idol
=
Soojin's Facial Acting
=
There's no evil, but I don't think Lovelyz's look is bad ...
=
Can you perform a ranking competition on Mnet now?
=
I was a fan of children but I thought that Miyeon and Suhwa weren't expressive until Queendom, but people also grew up competing.
=
It's scary
=
So-yeon, I'm so scared
=
Mnet employees should pay their salaries
=
The woman was her first love, and once she was a lover who loved to die like crazy, she felt so shocked and lost, and she felt like a cursed doll who had a psychotic illness and a depression. Is there Korean? Where are Koreans ?!
=
3:07 I was scared at the time.
=
I'm sure it's coming out .... I'm scared and scared. Is love changing ?! You can't be scared
=
Mnet's masterpiece is coming, but planning is too damn bad
=
Sincerely, I'm almost the first to see this idol stage I can't concentrate on other stages because I'm still stupid .... It's really ridiculously good.
=
Wow ...
=
Unaccompanied
=
Fell
=
It's not like dancing, but acting. Why are you so good at expressing yourself?
=
I keep looking back
=
So beautiful
=
It's not just people who are self-producing girls and are geniuses. 걍 Differences Not in comparison with other idols, but expressions are different from the performances of the public.
=
Wow, I finally laughed at Jeon So-yeon
=
There is no need to worry about the limits. If you shoot the best, then you change the genre and shoot the best again. There was no song that wasn't fresh from the title tracks to the Queen's stage so far ㅠㅠ Always bringing in a new genre
=
Seriously, Soyeon doesn't seem to be angry and Sujin is on the verge of working.
Minnie comes back already after one
The rainy season is so sad that I couldn't eat any snacks.
=
Ant
=
Seriously, why is this not the first place?
=
Wow, Soojin should act ..... When you rub your lips, your face is really ..... Awesome performance. .Awesome....
=
cool..
=
Honestly, it may not be able to digest the concept, but all the kids can't digest it, so they're so good.
=
The children are really big members, but each one's personality is so different. It's a team. How do you put them together?
=
Well, it sounds a bit like a date abuser, or a crazy person who couldn't accept a breakup.
=
I feel like I'm maximizing my feelings because this stage is so sad and heartbreaking.
25 From the idea, you get more money
=
I was really shocked at the crying and lipstick rubbing of Sujin, but I was looking at him with creepy eyes.
=
They're steamed Let's go first place Children's Jeon So Yeon's ant
=
Sujin Minni is the strongest but the rainy season is overwhelming. Shu-Hee Mi-yeon's cold atmosphere and not to mention God So-yeon
=
The children who came to the linen stage watching children's Queendom stage.
=
The real story is also alive and expresses his feelings with each member's tone. I also see Sujin brush her lips in the middle
Do you think the acting is so serious?
=
I don't think love will change
How did that hot change
Are you lying or
Say no to it now
Even if I do this
You can leave me
If you leave me this way
You can leave me
=
2:31 This scene is really creepy ... really eyes and trembling.
=
These guys are really good when they go overseas
=
2:31
And crazy
Really
Jackpot
Jackpot
=
3:21 I'm surprised
=
How can this not be number one ????? I understand that my girl is number one, but I can't understand that children aren't number one.
=
2:25 TT TT TT TT
=
Real genius Soyeon Cheon Soyeon
When I was in the ending, I laughed like a good memory when I said 'as good as it was,' and when I said 'I love you', I returned to reality and forced myself.
It's really crazy to melt the tempo and tempo emotions into the lyrics.
Exciting Songs In the world of music that can be divided into sad songs, children will become a new standard.
=
2:41 facial expression;
=
I think the kids best matched the theme of Pandora's Box.
=
OMG! Cada performance que veo de ellas me impresiona (・ o ・).
They are very talented.
=
It's a true fourth place.
=
This theme is difficult to digest.
=
I do not know how many times ;;; It's creepy every time I see it ...
=
I'm going to point out the heartbeat
2:25 Sujin lipstick. Why does Seo Sujin erase lipstick so beautifully ???????????????????
4:06 Let's take a look at how we handle nice eyes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:39 When the rainy season is half my eyes closed
=
What is it? ;;;; I thought it was creepy because I caught a cold right now, but I was creepy while sweating.
=
Children who wanted to express bizarre horror anger on stage .... And those who are awkward and completely successful. I'm so crazy
=
Wow, but I didn't know the kids were so pretty.
=
Keep your mouth closed and say no,
=
Unsurprisingly, there are few reactions of Seung-hee ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ haha
=
Perfect for the introduction to the audience scream timing.
=
This is the first time a female idol has expressed madness. Smearing lipstick, grafting modern dance, and putting expression before pretty. You can see that the color of the lighting also has a clear intention. It was said that the red costume is actually stained with blood. In the beginning, a man whose mouth was clogged with red tape ... probably couldn't speak with his mouth torn. He died of grotesque death and the reason for his farewell declaration. The woman who is the culprit of the murder goes crazy or goes crazy in sorrow and anger. Medium Medium speed is like an excited emotion ... Jeon So Yeon's appearance is creepy. Extremely defensive attitude with crossed arms and arms.
Children's color was unusual possession of vocals, genius producing, rap ... Jeon So-yeon's planning power itself is a weapon. The ability to grasp the members' talents and distribute the positions is great ... I never thought Shu was able to catch the eye. I was really surprised.
The rainy season makes Hong Kong mysterious. Too good for the stage itself.
=
Something I didn't usually use on this stage, So-yeon seemed to try to show the card so much.
=
It's a dog creepy. Real subtitles were good. It's impossible to take your eyes off. Jeon So-yeon No. God-so-yeon How do you support you?
=
Wow...
=
The rainy season Rapunzel's mom Looks like a witch
=
This stage was seen by all the children
=
The voices of the members' faces are all good, but it seems so great that Soyeon thought this song as an arrangement ... (+ Sujin's face ..)
=
I saw all the members. I knew why Soyeon was the member of her choice.
=
The rainy season is amazing. I thought other members would do as expected but the rainy season was pretty. I wasn't able to imagine it.
=
Someone who came to see
=
This stage should have been the last time, but it's a legend. I'm crazy for facial expression
=
3:05 Who is this ...? I was surprised
=
Oh, even if you look at it, it's really creepy, Soyeon is looking at the camera and laughing scary at the moment.
=
Children have facial acting ... real
=
Why is it fourth?
=
I don't think you hate it at first. Chi .. But when you plug in the earphones on both sides, you hear it alternately.
=
Now I'm really scared over a scary rookie.
=
Jandere, who often appears in Japanese novels and media? Obsessed and murdering ㅠㅠ Scary madness girl It's scary because it's such a concept.
=
Soyeon's Psycho Laughter Surprise the smoke and Sujin's lipstick, admire the crying eyes, crying in the sad deep blue eyes of the rainy season, lightning in Miyeon's beauty, and my sensation in slumber, my brow is falling into two and Minni's most overwhelming I knelt into my eyes and went into the ground.
=
The stage itself was insane, but the members were insane too. When I started Queendom, I only knew Jeon So-yeon, who came out from PewDue.
=
Soyeon feels like a woman G-Dragon
=
How can I love cubes? I love children.
=
How is this lower level?
=
I've come to see Ryan again, but this stage is really creepy .... The more I listen to the lyrics, the more I chew. The sadness of a woman who is crazy about love. The anger .. The emptiness .. The madness that collapses in pain .. Who can dare try this stage other than children? So-yeon ... Really ..
=
So-yeon's smile is so creepy and impressive
=
Wow, I just saw the Queendom stage. Crazy, crazy, crazy. I love you.
=
I wonder if this stage is the first place.
=
Real all stage.
I didn't expect to see the idol stage like this all the time .... No. 1 in the history of Queendom stage in my heart.
=
It's a real idol revolution. How do you think about this?
=
Minnie part song is so good, but Shu Hwa's head part really reminds me .. It looks so good .. The face looks a bit standing in the reeds, and it feels sober.
=
It's weird. The views are so high. Why is it ranking?
=
I love it so much
=
Sujin Crazy, really, when I erase the lipstick
=
This is fourth place ...?
=
Minnie's eyes look .....
=
Whenever I see Sujin lipstick, tears come out.
=
Everybody is tired of concept digestion ..... Really .. I love you sister ... ❤️
=
This song is really sad but it makes me feel obsessed and makes me feel scared.
=
Please vote for the girls at # 0011.
It's reflected in the girls' rankings.
Vote for # 0011 in time to see this.
=
Is this fourth place?

Please send 5 or girls to # 0011 !!

=
Unlike the other stages, the children's stage seems to have a charm to keep seeing again; I don't want to comment but I want to write a comment ;;; Minni's makeup is a face that can't be seen for a week .; Just like kids, the whole video can't even show the time of every kilopora ;; The rainy season was so cute all the time, but this time it's cute, but it looks so good that I don't just think it's cute, but I feel sadness. So it's fatal. I'm crying because I've been passing sad feelings. I didn't know the children well. This was all produced by Jeon So Yeon. I'm watching the queen and I'm a good boy
=
Wow ... it's really cool.
=
Real one
I've never commented on this stage, but this stage was so perfect that I couldn't express it in words that make comments .. The members' awesome facial expressions make the stage more immersive and I'm creepy all day long. I think children should be number one.
=
I think this is the first time this bizarre concept is ever, but I don't think anyone can do it in the future.
=
Say you don't want to see Halloween
=
I'm trying to make up for children's make-up under the light ㄹㅇ It shines on stage Han Han-soo is Jeon So-yeon Jeon, and God's two-members are members who digest the concept and regain the face of God
=
Jeon So-yeon concept I can't go out of the way ... How do you arrange ballads like this?
=
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm scared I love you Children, take my bank account
=
Surjin's expression on her lipstick was so grotesque and terrible, and the dancers especially amplified their feelings, especially with their hands and forearms. Jeon So-yeon's laughter at the end Two kiltpo ... There's nothing to discard
=
Jeon So-yeon writes as if he is a true genius, and comes up with ideas and arrangements this time and leads the team as a rare idol leader. There are other members who understand the concept and take control of the stage and act on their faces. Especially, when Sujin closes up, it looks like a creepy face. The woogie and Minnie are awesome and I knew the children were outstanding.
=
Queendom starts today at 9:20. Please vote. ❌ (Girls) Children or not kids ❌
Unconditional ✔️ Girls ✔️ I can not write ㅠ ㅠ Thank you everyone !! I'm sending you a hasty text message, you can't send girls.
=
Queendom's concept winner seems to be Oh My Girl with the kids. It's so great to dig into each other's extremes.
=
It's real, it's all generations. Girls, come on, really.
=
This team is always one step ahead. They prepare for performances that nobody did at first and then other teams prepare for the next competition.
=
☺ Pretty armpit
=
Fire tells me he hates sixth place, and fourth place ...
I'm secretly taking a camera Is not it..?
=
It's really scary from the fast forward part to the scouring lipstick
=
I don't understand why the stage is not at all yet.
=
Wow, the real children are crazy. Miyeon fits so well with the tone and song. Minnie feels dreamy. Soyeon is a genius and Sujin is really .. The rainy season is surprisingly good. I'm so good at you
=
It's fun to be a foreigner, but it's fun for people who are popular. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Debut Song Entering the chart every year, the second single limit was about a week or so. It's been a year. Music entry is still a rookie. It's a single digit .. Discussing the popularity in Korea to those kids ㅋㅋㅋ And the children did not have the popularity in the Queendom ~ 1st competition Neka 1st, Korea Youtube popular video 1st, 3rd competition Neka 1st popular Korean Youtube video 2nd place children had a hammock lol and October idol brand reputation ?? It's second only after the Wolkle Namdol.
=
Jeon So Yeon is really smart and whispers with Minnie tone, Shoe Hwa innocence Visuals, Lipsticks in Sujin, Slippers, Rainy eyes of rainy season, etc.
=
I'm the most memorable stage in Queendom .. I did the best. Really just the artist itself .. I can say it with confidence when I see them. 'Idol is not anyone.' ..
=
2:30 Really bad dogs .. Really ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm so crazy .. I love you so much. I love you so much. I don't know. I don't know. Is it human or is it not God?
=
It was really a stage legend and I heard Ryan but it's really hard. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Minnie chewed on the 1st contest and the 2nd contest was so full that Soojin 3rd is all full so don't be nervous in the rankings. I would really like to show only the maximum that children can show ♥ And I think that the stage is not 4th place and all the views are the highest. When I posted this, the popularity was rising 1 2 3 It was not only seen by many foreign fans but also by many Korean fans I'm a fan as well. There were foreigners in the bleachers in the main room, but there's no room for foreigners. Do you attract foreigners? ㅠㅠ Anyway, you'll think this stage is number one forever ... ㅠㅠ
=
Real Soyeon goes well with any song
=
Soyeon's writing skills are really great ❤
=
Why isn't real Eva just a field vote?
=
1:35 The goddess of wind and waves seemed to be betrayed by love
=
Please vote for the live Queendom live tomorrow. Please ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Ah, but I've found something interesting ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ It's a coincidence. The team also finished 6th, then 4th, and the crying children were 6th last time. Even though the score was low, Minni Hyejeong was very good
=
Minnie was really ... the color of this group was crazy.
=
It's a man who loves me because of the spell he did in Latata. Do you love me? If you leave, I'll be like you, but are you really going to leave? It's like a shaman who's been crazy about reality
=
Rainy season, my eyes are all attractive
=
Mimi expression in the middle ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
This song was a legend for me., It was great to remove lipstick and my eyes fluttered. It was creepy.
=
Jeon So-yeon .... If you are really talented, what would it be like? If you encounter Jeon So-yeon, please start with me.
=
This stage is also a legend of all members. Really, every moment was perfect. Jeon So-yeon, who designed everything for that, is crazy and all the members of Woo-gi Minnie Sujin Shu-hwa, who completely digested it, are crazy. I think it was a legendary stage to be left in the history of music industry. Every second was very perfect. I am thankful that I was born with my children.
=
Wow ... this is steaming ... this is steaming ... this is the one that erases the lipstick and Soyeon is creepy in the first and last part ...
=
Seosujin ~~~ Lipstick hit!
Children Billboard Gazua ~~~ ^^
=
I don't know how many times I've seen this stage.
=
Expresses feelings that can't be seen. 100 points
=
How is this fourth?
=
No, it's just crazy to erase Sujin lipstick.
=
I did a good job, but amnet is fourth ??? If you do, just say they don't like it.
=
Of course I thought it was at least 2nd
=
Wow ... Idol class talent.
=
Sujin's Lipstick Shaking Eyes and Lips
Minni's spirit
Half-eyed eyes after the lipstick removal of the rainy season
Shu's vague atmosphere
Soyeon's real crazy woman
Miyeon's solid vocals
It is perfect
=
People look pretty much the same
Sujin's erasing lipstick ...
Wow ... this is ... the real look and movement
I was born
=
Personally, I saw Sujin's facial expressions and exposed the highlights of the stage in advance so that the freshness of the stage disappeared. I was worried about it. Just every member, every part is a highlight.
=
If you know how to practice, you can practice acting only if you know how to act.
=
All the members were good, but I'm especially open to Minnie's peculiar eyes.
=
01:16 My expression
=
I think that Soyeon will be promoted to the rank of cube director.
=
Female idols were a time when they were able to see and listen to music with high musicality in the age of cute, sweet or sexy. Thumbs up.
=
I put an X-shaped tape in the first man's mouth and the lyrics say "I don't like it." The members are crazy
=
Miyeon, Shuhwa: Sadness before work
Rainy season, Soyeon: Myeongjung
Sujin, Minnie: kill one person
=
Honestly, I thought it was Jeon Soyeon and children until I saw Queendom.
=
Miyeon and Shuhwa Until recently, the acting wasn't so good, but this stage seems to be perfect. Immersion really good, and the shoe feels like a Japanese doll.
=
When I look at the whole children of this stage, I think every member sprouts like a legend. I don't know how many times the member's direct cam is seen. But I ended up revenge, but it was a bit vain, and it was a bit vain. When I was finished, my face was so conveyed that I felt creepy and impacted, but it was only me .. (I don't have much talk ,,) My face keeps coming back
=
Really great !!!!
=
Mimi's face is real?
=
Awesome ... except for the word ...
=
Sometimes children think they're new ... they're really over.
=
What kind of girl idols with bare skin in bare feet with lipstick removed from the stage and the madness concept? Even if I've been on the stage barefoot, my legs have doubled the width of my shoulders, or my toes have never been outward.
I'm holding the development direction of the world like this
=
Even if you're not like it, this challenging stage is a million times better.
I'm just looking for cutie sexy innocence and I'm just looking for the eyes and watching this stage I've opened my eyes until I'm done.
=
Pact's kids are overwhelmingly chewing on every contest.
=
2:44 D. C. Smoked Really
=
How loud the fans shout can be heard in the video ...
=
4:06 Minnie
=
4:38 Superb
=
Oh, I really like it. It's awesome.
=
2:52 perfection
=
They're really scared of rice cakes, they're going to get scarier.
The finale is the main destination for a few years.
My skills are so ... Wow
All these songs are good too
=
Next time, I would like to adapt the rain boots and red lotus in the style of a girl idol. TT TT TT Please see me.

I was surprised to see the results .... I was really good at this time. Children can be first or third place ... ;;;;;;;;;;; ::
=
No, Mi-yeon's face after Soyeon's rap part I was really immersed and I was watching the stage, but I saw my face and it went off completely ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Quality that should be used on mama stage
=
I'm really a fan of the singer, but it's creepy to express it, but this is the fourth place.
=
It's applied to Sujin
=
Bizarre ...
=
Missing this video watching Minnie .....
=
Are you mad at fourth place?
=
When you cut your hair with a single haircut, you couldn't stop if you saw my sister
=
I'm not a fan, but every time I think they're pioneering the genre of 'kids', I expect it to be scary three years later, five years later, and ten years later.
=
1. Songwriter Arrangement + Idea Jeon So-yeon
2. About 5 million views
3. Concepts that no one tried
4. Singing Performance Performance Stage Composition Coordination Perfection
5. Complete the storyline from the police line to the end before the song starts
6. Therefore, the work and the publicity at once
7. The fact that there are a lot of overseas fans in the kids fan base
8. But in the global era, overseas fans are also popular.
9. A lot of overseas fans are incredible in their second year of debut, which may not even have representative songs.
10. It is reasonable to argue that because the venue is a standing seat, audience members couldn't see this stage because they were creepy on each face.
11. It can be seen in stage size or distance to the camera or in terms of audience.
12. I usually remember that there were at least two close-up screens when I was making a concert or music broadcast outdoor stage.
13. So I doubted that there wasn't a display board with a close-up screen when Mnet was originally produced.
14. In the middle of the stage, the dancers are so bizarre and sudden that it is hard to see, so the claim is that the ranking has fallen.
15. But when you understand and see the whole story of the stage, and before the dancers' dance starts, can you leave me?
16. Also, in the last Nana Sea, the male dancers and the dancers in this year's dislikes, of course, may want to enrich the meaning of the song, but the people who are active in the minor genres are sent out on the air. I guess that there is a meaning of respect that I want to lose
17. The unit stage and the Pandora stage itself are totally different in character, but they add up and rank ...
18. I thought unit stage was unnecessary for the contest because I thought it was not a fair contest from the beginning while I planned to divide the unit into performances and vocals.
19. However, anyway, fans can receive various stages in a short time and don't want to fight fandom.
20. But it is not a real comeback, but I wish I could have appreciated the efforts of the artists who participated in the contest by changing their souls.
21. In the meantime, the singers are preparing a new song and preparing for the contest.
22. Children's new song is also a song composed by Jeon So-yeon, so I know a lot of schedules, but I worry about when to rest and work
23. It is quite shocking that only one team can stand on the comeback stage with this effort.
24. If all released music is released individually, the top chart is unconditional.
25. Currently, the singers in the music source are too competitive (Taeyeon, MC Mong, Vea Girl, etc.)
26. Most people who don't even know about Queendom due to lack of self-promotion
27. I know that the ranking of the music sources is counted in the contest, but the album jacket photo is the original purple Queen logo, so I can't compare it with the previous music and I can't see the characteristics of the team and the song.
=
This is the best part, but I personally want to see the whole stage direct cam. I wasn't the only one.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius. Lyrics in this place are mine.
=
Children are the best predators of the current generation of idols. They are geniuses who will lead this era. Thank you for being active.
=
Say you don't like it in the nightmare version.
=
Really .. I don't know how many times I go around.
=
If Jeon So-yeon carries such a hard carry, some members will be buried.
=
It's really ant, and how is this stage for the kids who debuted last year? Jeon So Yeon is a real Gaecheon inventory. This is the first order of this stage. Two stages haven't been seen in the back. All members have a killing point.
=
It is a girl group performance stop.
Jeon So-yeon just thought I'd be bored at the time of production. I'm drawing that picture in my head at that age.
Awesome.
=
So Yeon-ah, I want to do this experimental stage, I can't think that it wasn't so bad that I'll see it on the air. Where are the members' stats?
=
It's my first time seeing a real idol feeling like this ... I think I saw a crazy woman acting mad because of a man in a horror movie.
=
I think I love you even if you get it
=
Let me see a lot of these stages at the year end awards.
=
Children's Queendom is as cool as ever
=
Wow, how are they the newest guys?
=
I don't understand it, but I can't understand it. I think the dancers performed a bit bizarre on stage.
=
Personally, I don't see the other team's stage and I don't think about it. Lovelyz and Oh My Girl are both a favorite group, but it was just a music-centered feeling. I love it
=
No matter who the final result is, the kids are number one in the end.
=
Geniuses seem to gather together for music. I used to think that Soyeon stood out. There seems to be no member with presence
=
Oh, it's really scary and steamy, but I think I've seen a musical, and it's really amazing. I'm bizarre, but it's really the best.
=
3:06 ....
=
Half of this stage also played a part in the performance of the members So Yeon did not say that Sujin, Minni Woogi Shuhwa Miyeon is good at acting
=
Is this modern dance?
=
Legend ... the rainy season really pretty ghosts
From Soyeon's facial expressions to Sujin's lip erasing.
=
I don't really like it, and every time I hear rap song rap, it's creepy ... The surroundings get cold ...
=
Minjin looks at the scene, so it's a pity that Sujin can't see the smoke well. We're catching each individual with a camera, but at the scene, we'll just see the dance, and the details can't be seen. .
=
When you watch the broadcast, you can see the details like facial expressions, but you don't see it well in the field evaluation, so the number of votes seems to be low. It's a pity that it's not 2nd but 4th.
=
Hope the kids find out that the views outside the program are a real contest!
=
3:06 Mimi Expression My Expression
=
I've seen it before, but the rankings aren't really touching in this competition.
=
3:06 I was scared the most ... This wasn't the fourth song.
=
I can't really explain it
Mnet program is making a good haha
=
I'm a real Queendom. I wasn't really interested in idols.
=
4:07 Minnie's eyes are creepy
=
Why are you watching this video? Why are you crying?
=
The stage is good but the reactions of other idols are cute and funny ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I don't like it when I'm rolling kids around on Amnet
This time, I'm just fishing for the second place.
Overseas like bulletproof
Let's go play, and I can't even touch the Amnet craps.
=
First place vote if not online vote.
=
Sorry. I can't admit it's 4th.
=
Honestly, I'm a fan of Mamamu
=
Honestly, I've heard this song for the first time and I liked it so much that I liked it from the original but it's getting better ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ But this song is not the first place I thought it was the first place ㅠㅠ I am sad even though I know I can't help it
=
Shuhwa always sunny, so I thought it was really cute, but at about 1:48 Shuhwa ..
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
I'm a miracle, but it's a performance that won't work for Oh My Girl. At least 2nd and 3rd places are the most memorable stages and the most memorable stages. Other fans see me more than 8 times.
=
This is the first stage
=
It's not related to this stage ..... Kay is cool in the middle .. But I'm only salty .. Kay also wanted to do that stage. Im ㅠ But children are good at the stage ㄹㅇ
=
I'm discouraged because it's low .. Because the children have already been caught in Korean or overseas rice cakes. Children's Jeon So-yeon has been cast by Riot !! 2 consecutive times !! This time, she plays Akali and sings like KDA popstar! November 10 release!
=
I'd like to add some freestyle rap and views.
=
The more you give me the rank, the more Jeon So-yeon will wake up.
=
If you notice, register Jeon So-yeon
=
Do you know that? The ranking is 1st or 6th, and every time the number of children's video views is the highest. ㅋㅋㅋ Don't tell me you hate it. Lata and Fire have more than 10 million views. Please don't give up if you didn't get the ranks and give me a lot of concepts and songs.
=
If you see this, you'll come in.
=
How is this stage fourth ?!
Did the rank change?
It's really creepy but the concept is so sad in anger.
=
Honestly, I was good at Oh My Girl, but it's not the stage for kids
=
If the girl group's idols are Girls' Generation, then the new ones are not children. While BLACKPINK TWICE is in the midst of the trend, these challenging and unexpected concepts of children, and the expression and performance of the awkward facial expressions, will be the standard for 'idol' in the future.
=
The last lyrics are creepy
In the original song, "Like a good time .. I can't love it now ..."
In the arrangement, I write a number to make you say that you like me .. ㄷ "Keep telling me like that.
=
Sujin must be crazy. How can I get that facial smoke?
=
I can't help but say that I'm really crazy It's the first time I've written a new history of idols I'm so proud that I started with children Even though I've seen this concept abroad, it's wonderful to try this concept as an idol in Korea
=
Honestly, the unit's score and the special evaluation team have a big influence.
=
Jeon So-yeon was crazy to think of this, and all the children were crazy. Sujin's crying smoke and So-yeon laughed at the end.
=
Miyeon Shuhwa is better to practice facial expressions
Sujin and Minnie are the concept.
=
Shouldn't you pay ????? Is this stage free ???????!?!? Kids pretend to be a mistake and put up an account ..
=
Rainy Minnie What's Visual?
=
Rather than trying to look really pretty, she does her best for the best performance. Really cool
=
We are serious with creepy battering
I want to see more stage
=
When I was on stage, I didn't have any new face. And I caught a concept nightmare. I felt like a real nightmare.
=
Ranking Why
=
Every time I see why do you want to do So-yeon? I think so, Soyeon is a genius
=
Sujin, it's creepy
=
Everyone was good, but Sujin is a horrible smoke-sucking member. Even if I go to the actor later
=
Minni Makes me work I'll have a good taste Minnie should say something like drawing paper It's the face of cloth to make up according to the technique of make-up and hair styling.
=
Honestly, I don't understand why the kids ranked fourth in the competition .. (Girls) Children should be able to adapt to the vote (?) And children, girls. At least children can recognize Mnet.
=
[Personally creepy point clearance]
Sujin 2:31
-It's really creepy to lip.
Rainy season 3:38
-Real poodle poodle
Not 3: 3
-I'm really impressed to see this time. I'm dying.
Minnie 4:07
-Just ... infinite looping.
=
It's crazy and it's crazy
=
In fact, I thought Miyeon was the flattest member of the children, but when I saw this stage, I changed my mind. Miyeon is not so visible but seems to be a pillar that gives the group a solid place invisible. The visuals of the Jungseok Beauty Impression are mesmerizing, but they do not fall behind in their competence, while they are unique and buzzing voices. The only drawback is that there is a slight lack of dancing and facial expressions, but as you gain experience, it will be covered to some extent.
=
So Yeon sister made a real arrangement like a genius ... The members' acting skills are just geniuses, and the coordination details are just geniuses.
=
Wow, I've done something to my ex-boyfriend when I removed Sujin lipstick. I didn't do anything wrong. You didn't like me. That's how I did it. I don't do anything wrong.
=
I'm looking forward to children, but if Soyeon's career is made later
=
This is the artist, I've never been to an idol concert, but they really want to go
=
I think they only gathered geniuses. I can't count how many creepy things they've seen in this stage.
Have a good time
=
I'll see you again. Really. It's already the fifth time. Every time I see it, it's creepy. It's the first time I really want to see the video.
=
02:30 Sujin Wow ... the smoke is so delicate ...
=
I can't believe the operation king Mnet contest ranking
=
Wow, well done, fourth place ...
=
It's really ridiculous. Why is this fourth?
=
Fourth place is because Queendom is Mnet ~
=
I'm a pure Gem Duck with no interest in idols
This is the first time I've gotten creepy on an idol stage on YouTube.
=
Why is this the fourth place?
=
I'm really excited about the children's year-end stage
=
Did this song go 4th place? All the acting is good and there's nothing missing from expression to tone ;;;;
=
It's not enough to give first place. What's the fourth place?
=
4:34 I feel like I'm talking about the whole stage.
=
And what about Mimi Reaction? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Take a fly in your mouth Mimiya ,,,
=
I think it's all crazy.
=
It's really cool. The game ends from removing lipstick.
=
Honestly, this stage is for children 1.2.
At first, I thought it was similar to Latata because it was bizarre, but I was surprised at the concept, acting, and Jeon So-yeon rap.
=
I'm not an idol artist
=
Mnet probably doesn't have eyes, and he won't continue to operate even after seeing so many comments.
=
It's not a sub-stage stage. Really ... I personally liked my stage, but it wasn't underestimated.
=
Isn't it a real hit?
=
I see you on YouTube a few times .. This stage is not here. I want to see it at the year-end awards stage.
=
This is the fourth place I thought one team out of Oh My Girl and the children would come first and second;
=
Another thing to note here is that all members have a coupling on the left finger ring. I am wearing a coupling that is a symbol of couples, but this trivial expression is more creepy. Minnie `` aches '' at the first chorus, and the ring shines
=
Sujin when I noticed .. Sujin right? The last time you smile, the more you see it, the more you see the details, the more you see it.
=
The concept is real .. The only ones who are able to do this in the Queendom are those who can do this. Replying to @JustinLee
=
This is it.
=
I honestly thought I would be number one
=
Is this fourth? No way real ;;
=
It's not crazy! It's crazy but bizarre
=
October 31 text vote (woman) children
=
I know that the unit score is low ... This stage is a stage that is more than enough to chew low unit scores. It's good for you. Even the idols piled up consecutively can't be challenged
It's great to be able to digest it well so I hope you don't have to.
=
Even though I've been talking about it, I keep thinking about it
=
All other members are mentioned, why is this not the last Jeon So-yeon acting crazy ;;;;; I watched this scene dozens of times a day
=
Look at Sujin's eyes
=
Honestly, it wasn't the fourth place. How was the stage 4 ?????!
=
Did you see Mnet again? How is this fourth place; Director and emotion are all first class ;;
=
4th place !？
=
I'm sorry for the oh my girl, but this is better ...
=
How many scenes were there that were creepy
=
What a blessing the cube got, those kids rolled in
=
Earlier, they saw Jeon So-yeon carry and the other members were free. Every member is overflowing with nothing missing
=
I didn't care about the ranking because Queendom itself felt like a Korean rock festival, but I don't understand that the fourth stage of this stage is not a typical concept. It's a fact, but the result is not understood
=
Sujin is shaking her lips while removing lipstick.
=
If you wear only the shoe red shoes, the atmosphere is not a joke. Feel like a Chinese-style fine doll ,?
=
It's more creepy, bizarre and cool because you don't know the original song.
=
It's really creepy when the speed gets faster.
Soyeon has the best facial expression
Are you really sad when you erase lipstick? I expressed that feeling well
Minni got the tone in the first part, and the atmosphere was concentrated. Shu Hwa was really best at flipping her hair. Miyeon really increased her facial expressions, and Woogi was really scared despite her cute face. It's weird if you don't go to the top without fan fan. There is not much Halloween left, and this Halloween is children.
=
I'm crazy. I'm shocked. I can't see anything. I can't concentrate.
=
Mnet vote everything. Just include the children vote. Even though mothers didn't like it, it doesn't make sense. All-time
=
Stage feel: I decided to think of it as a manipulation
=
It's not comparable to the team members who wrote the lyrics and arranged the stage. How can the ranking be lower?
=
Seriously, the more I look at it, the more I'm scared of comments
It's ridiculous if it's a rookie, but girls are a girl group.
Everyone is definitely a genius.
=
Soyeon is crazy to think of this concept, but the rest of the members who digest it are crazy.
=
1:56 2:43 4:04 4:16 4:47 Write down your favorite parts.
=
Miyeon looks good with this hair, but I hope you come back with this hair ... ㅠㅠ
=
Mimi makes me look surprised because I'm just watching the stage .... I'm more scared because of Mimi's makeup ...
=
This is the best view on YouTube, but also the most comments. Ranking means nothing. Children show me this concept ... Why the fourth place?
=
Honestly, this time the stage is so well designed that the full cam is scarier and the concept looks better than the editorial.
=
"It's their first year of debut."
?
=
I just don't know. Girls are number one.
=
It's the first time I've been creepy on stage .... It's not a song but a performance performance.
=
It feels like I've seen a horror movie in the meantime ... The children are just geniuses.
=
2:32 Sujin's facial acting is crazy.
=
Minnie's face is so good.
=
3:06 A heartfelt expression.
=
2:25 Killing Part
=
I hope you don't have a popular and obvious song on this day. I watched this stage 50 times ㅠㅠㅠ
=
1:43 At this time, the rainy season is so hot and sexy, why not mention it?
=
Do you like it because it's 4th place ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
This perforon should be number one or two.
=
If you're done with the Queendom, you can vote cleanly.
=
This is why Ozzie is fourth.
1. In the late stage of the scene, there were many choreographers who sat down so that they could not see the front row.
2. If you have a special evaluation team
3. It's far from the scene so I can't see facial expressions well ...
4. Unit stage score floor
=
The power of the stage is the best. I'm the first in my heart.
=
Maybe you're talking to Amnet.
=
I wander around my ear and come around.
=
I see, Queendom is voting. Nobody can believe it;
=
Minny
=
Expected ranking
First-class Om Girls or Children
One of the top two teams
Third place
4th Prize
5.Park Bom
6.Eoe
I thought it was embarrassing.
=
Mom, I'm scared here
=
2:39 Who is it?
=
It's crazy. Each one is a true artist
=
2:25 Sujin suddenly got faster BPM, but I hate it. I'm slowing down here. I'm confused about what I'm saying. I'm confused about what I'm saying. I felt so upset ... I'm so ...
=
No. It's the fourth place where this stage really looks; I thought it would be the second place
=
I think the first place is a stage to get at least third place
=
I don't know why
=
Isn't it a combination of specials and unit stages? No. I want to believe that.
=
I hope you do this concept a lot
=
The rainy season's hair varies from concept to concept. ... so why is it fourth?
=
I thought it was the first place. Why not?
Why the hell is it even lower ????
=
I'm scared .. I thought I watched a real horror movie. I think it's an artistic stage.
=
I watch this tenth video and it's still creepy but it doesn't make sense to rank low;
=
Can you give me a ranking?
=
The girls said that they only see So-yeon and Su-jin. I'm sorry. I'm sorry ... I will reflect ... Each one is so unique and so good. This is really fresh and attractive! By the way, fourth place ????? Does it make sense? I don't understand
=
I thought omg girls and children would split first and second; Wow, I was wondering who was the first, but I felt like I was on the air.
=
Oh, amnet really like.
=
Oh, I haven't seen that in real life.
=
I don't understand why this is the fourth place. I don't understand. Even if you give me the first prize and award, it's the fourth place.
=
Stage that looked like contemporary art ㅠㅠ I can only express it as art and I was not interested in Sujin, but when I erase the lipstick, my emotions are conveyed to me and I feel tired
=
Do you think this stage is fourth? Isn't it frustrating for the Queendom kids? If this stage is fourth, I'm the number one dancing dog?
=
How is this fourth place ... I don't understand.
=
The quality is low, so it's not for 4, so I don't need to be intimidated by fans.
=
Honestly, aren't kids saving the Queendom views? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ There are a lot of overseas fans just by looking at Lanata or Fire.
=
Why is this ...
=
Why are children fourth? ;;;
=
I don't watch the Queendom, I just watch YouTube, but please let me know the overall ranking. If this is the fourth place, who is the top ;;;;
=
Really try this one more time
=
I can't hate u ...
=
There are mazes and blow your mind when you say no, and there are many other good songs that express the children's view of the world, and I wanted to win something with this calming song. Wow. What I wanted to do now is to believe and see what I do as a fan.
=
Cube is the real thing to Jeon So-yeon.
=
Can't you give a real YouTube popularity score ??? I always got a fandom and was 6th last time, but this time my mothers came.
=
ㅇㄴ Amnet is working again?
=
Minni's look is scary when I'm originally expressionless
=
And So Yeon are really geniuses
The children who digest it all are geniuses.
=
It's more scary than the shaman Ratata ... The original song is a decent song.
=
I think it was a huge idol stage that I have never seen before ...
=
When I say "I don't like it" in the middle of Sujin, I am sad and scary.
=
Wow, it's the first time I thought it was scary while watching the stage ㅋㅋ ㅋㅌㅌ ㅌㅌㅌㅌ ㅋㅌㅌㅌ ㅋㅋㅌㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Wow ...
=
The breakthrough attempt and the success were separate, but the kids caught both.
Usually the girl group is innocent cutie sexy girl crush, and grotesque & anger is a minor genre that can't try or succeed. I want to applaud the courage and ability that showed this.
It's really great to have a cool and appalling response from the public so that it isn't too crowded. Expressive power is also cut. Even if you don't explain what emotion you want to show, you act perfectly.
The only group that can show sorrow, anger, madness, and grotesque and stage it for the masses will be children.
..Children are possible attempts and success
=
I couldn't see the stage because it was too dark.
=
It's not a real idol stage, but a horror musical, but I've seen it ... Not to mention Jeon So-yeon, the members aren't expressive, and I'm looking at the beginning of Sujin's verse 2 and Soyeon's rap part. I don't know, but it's a concept coming soon with Halloween, and it's a manipulation
=
I'm afraid this is also a masterpiece. I was scared of the children, but it's the fourth place.
=
I was surprised to feel what I wanted to express. It was called anger in sadness, but it seemed to be revealed when I smeared lipstick in the middle, and it was scary and creepy.
Jeon So-yeon produced is capable and awesome, but the members who follow and digest it are amazing. I hope you'll hit the next activity after Queendom
=
No, Sujin is acting Obasa. I'm really good. I love you creepy.
=
Even the screams of the audience are felt as stage equipment.
=
For those who do not understand this ranking
The debut fan and the official Neplan's official first, Go3 Active, are full version 4k full cam member job cams at least 10 days a day, sucking at least 10 days a week, and watching the entertainment community such as Bluebird Inti, who had a hard time reaching out for the heat. Analyze why
1. Difference in Unit Score
: I don't know how different the number of votes is, but the score difference is 1,000 points in vocal unit 1.2.3.
But the Perfor unit gives the score according to the vote rate. 2500 points for 1st place, 24xx points for 2nd place, 23xx points for 3rd place.
Question: Why did you do that? Shouldn't they do the same, either by percentage of votes or by absolute evaluation?
Maximum victims of these score allocations: children
-3rd vocal unit score difference
-There is not much difference in score for third place perfor unit
Anyway, the children with both ♡ vocal medals of the vocal unit perforated unit have almost 1 ~ 2000 points lower than those of ㅁㅁㅁ, ㅇ ㅁㅇㄱ and ㄹㅂㄹ.
2. Limit of Field of View and Children's Stage Composition
: As you can see on the stage, there is a lot of floor choreography. (I struggled with my knees) But there was no seat step on the scene (I don't know whether it is seat or standing).
Also, when I see the full cam, the reaction of the field makes sense, and I don't see any expression. Since the lights are so strong and there is no screen, the actors' shameless acting might not have been felt unless they are completely in front.
-> The most outstanding thing on this stage was the acting of the facial expression and the stage composition.
3. Stage order and concept overlap
: Can you hear the screams in the video? Steamed scared That's ... It's scarier than the horror drama. Although their original intentions are well-inspired, they're proud, but the atmosphere itself is so scary that many people don't get a lot of votes. (Bonebreak dancers also share ... I'm good.) Some people said that it was not their own style
I'm careful, but when I take out the brainstorming, I personally think that the concept is a bit similar in this big frame of 'horror' with ㅇ ㅁㅇㄱ people. So the less frightened people who staged in the back order seemed to get better ratings. I thought I was so scary and shocked and scared so I could focus on the stage itself rather than fear. ㅇ ㅁㅇㄱ ㅅㅎ said in the interview, "I thought you would hate" was in that context. And it was a good stage. Anyway, it is my opinion that it was positive in many ways for those who played in the back order than children.
4. Special Evaluation Team
: Well, as you all know, the main parts ... I wasn't surprised by the expected result. The other candidates were broadcast academy students and foreigners, and it was a little disappointing to think that if they were one of them ...
5. General audience
: I received each fandom at the same rate, and received a separate application for general audiences.Because of the experience of listening to this music program, I recorded almost 6 hours in one hour of broadcasting. I think there won't be much ... Of course, big and old fandoms will be mixed in the 'public' ... Debut freshly over one year old, freshly recruited 1st official, even fans coming in through this stage Was it in?
In my experience, if I give 2 votes per person, it is divided into three cases.
A. Choi Ae Team 1 + Cha Ae Team 1
N. Favorite Team 1 + 1 void vote
C. Choi Ae Team 1 + Choi Ache Team 1
If Choi Ae is not a child, it means that he or she will never give a ticket to those who are 'competitive' even though they're good at it.
I understood this with my head, but I couldn't possibly accept the fourth place ... and who gave it to the children below. Is that a check? Do you really think they did better?
+ Quadruped
I just want this contest to disappear. Don't rank it; It's a fandom fight. This is ... It's a little over a year since the kids debut, but it's absolutely unfavorable; The new stage unit stage is all good, but it's a fan fight for you
Don't you really do Kingdom, Amnet? That's all I'm done. So if you put the Namdols, you'll know what it's like. If you stick them, don't think of Queendom 2, but let's just rationalize it and let the 6 teams come back.
=
I talk about Sujin a lot, but the facial expressions are crazy, but something Jeon So-yeon only talks about planning and leadership, but the rap part was really lyrical and expressive, especially when everyone was scared and sad. It was crazy acting to go away with psychopaths ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Because of the image that Jeon So Yeon is so unique
=
Real children may be crazy ... I never imagined that I would be able to see this stage.
Red Mini Dress + Unsuitable Barefoot Outfit from the Costume + Red Lipstick + It's Crying and Smearing + Digestion of Sorrow into Madness + Perfection + Perfect Performance
I'm sick of saying what you're saying, I love you children, you're my queen
+ I think this stage more clearly than the champion, who showed who Quinn is.
=
I'm a fan of omg girls, but I've watched dozens of times a day and decided on Fleee first.
=
Seosujin's lips are really crazy How do you think to express it like that?
=
Like the Nanahae, this stage has a high degree of completion but Ho-ho-ho was a split stage.
=
Why are you crying?
=
Of course I thought it was # 1 ...
=
But I thought it would be the second place ... This seems to be art, not Queendom. But the reason why the children were fourth: People who went to the scene said that it was a stage where there was a lot of dislikes. There are a lot of foreign members in children, and children are popular with foreigners.
=
How is this stage 4th? I personally think that this stage was the best. I'm acting on my face, singing, dancing, and there's no space. Why is this lower? What kind of madness can I express so well? It's a lot of fun to see ... I'm still not sure that this is the fourth place ... I expected the first place to be unconditional ...
=
No, it's the ranking of the vocal unit dance unit. But what is fire?
=
It's amazing how they arranged what they didn't do and I'm one pick in the Queendom.
=
Only me 2:50 Do you like to rap here? LOL You can jump in and beat the beat too well and rap and wow, you can leave me at the end. Why is it not first place?
=
This video is for Sujin to see the terrible scared teeth when he erases the lip ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Rank ㄹㅇ Meaning Sincere girls were not interested but listen to the songs;
=
The fourth place is not a voting operation, but the unit score is added.
=
Wow .. how many times does this really goose bumps .. Really I want to stage once more with this concept .. ㅠㅠ
=
I'm just saying it's a real dog.
=
It's awesome, I'm really surprised
=
I'm not a fan, but Sujin lipstick erasing scene, I'm floating on Instagram and I've come to youtube to see the stage .... I'm creepy all the time ... No. This is not the first place ㅠㅠ .. ㅠㅠㅜ Girls are the best ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Real facial expressions are really good and the concept is unfamiliar and good, but the concept is so unfavorable that the ranking seems to be low ... ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I'm a bit brighter than this concept too.
=
3:38 My God ...
=
Wow, there's a ring on the fourth finger.
=
I can't keep forgetting in my head
=
This is fourth place.
I saw this and gave it to Minnie ㅠㅠ ❤ Fighting children❗
=
Good. Good .. I want to see a lot
=
3:06 Every time I see a surprise.
=
Wow, this is not the first place ...
=
4: 224: 22
4: 224: 22
Shu look look ....
=
2:30 Look at the acting creepy
=
This time, I was forced to be number one.
=
You won't see it in any other girl group.
Melmu or tell me that you don't like children at that time.
=
I didn't realize that someone was saying goodbye to the shoe, and Minnie had already died. ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Too funny ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Didn't get the first one after commenting? Of course, all the other stages were good, but this is the stage legend.
=
Korea's idols are global. Whoa ~
=
Like real lovelys and kids, I really like the colors that only the group can do.
=
I've been completely into Om of Queendom but I think this is the best
=
The rankings are unfortunate, but regardless of the rankings, everyone is doing well .. Don't dwell on the rankings. Prove it. 아 It's a bit unfortunate to be in fourth place,
=
I don't think your sister Amnet is. I'm singin 'my sisters all day long, how is this lower level ;;
It's a stage where nobody thinks it's a sub-stage, so I hope you keep doing it.
=
There was nothing to miss from the beginning to the end. Really. Look at the facial expression smoke. It's children too!
=
I sang a song .. It's funny. Pretty. I'm glad.
=
Oh my girl. Overall, I thought Omgirl was good, but when they look at their facial expressions, they are creepy. Especially the lip erasing part and the last part are really unforgettable scenes. I don't watch the broadcast but I only watch it on Youtube. I think I'm overwhelmingly better than everyone else.
The station is good
=
Whoever was the best
=
Why are there so many people who don't recognize the right stage?
=
The stage quality and composition is very different from other teams. It feels like watching a real horror movie
=
Honestly, all other groups are good, but there are no groups to follow the children's stage. Amnet ... It's pretty, but the concept and the stage are completely different. Can anybody make a good fire? The other group can do a pretty, refreshing and exciting atmosphere. Who can really do this?
=
Minnie makeup is amazing
=
This song is sung in class and this is 4th place ..? ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Wow ... I'm surprised at the slightest reaction in the middle.
=
I'm not a fan of idols in Queendom. Why aren't you number one? I thought it was crazy. I was really looking at it. I've been doing it ㅋㅋ 2:30 I'm tired of facial expressions but I've seen Jeon So Yeon rap how cheap it is ㅠ Honestly, performance and song concept are all 1st and I understand why it's not first place.
=
As much as this stage, the shouts of fans are creepy and scared
=
The production of Soyeon's sister is also a great composer, but at first she decides the song and stage atmosphere and drags the stage.
=
Minnie, is that horror? Mysterious sounds and sensations.
=
One question here
Why does Sujin have no country?
=
It was like a stage where I saw an Everland horror experience, especially 2:47 Here, I wanted the kids to be scared because they couldn't stand the creepy screams from the squeezing lips. I was really scared ...
=
Honestly, I didn't like the bizarre and it hurt my head so it wasn't easy for me to see the stage, but I thought the quality of the children's facial acting, stage production, and arrangement were very original and well expressed.
I realize once again that the greatest advantage of the group is children's facial expressions. All members were really good at acting on this stage
=
If you see this stage and don't know that Soyeon is a genius, it's stupid. Stage planning, arrangement, competence as a personal idol, and leadership.
=
I'm glad Cube wants you to do it because it's a company. Let's care more about welfare and publicity .. ^^
=
Mimi in the middle is killing
=
Crazy stage with only girls
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real monster .. Honestly, it looks straight and looks small. It's hard not to be a stage where there's a smash. The Korean public likes the familiar and straight-forward concept, but it is a group that looks forward to the future because it challenges new things and is good at it again.
=
I think it's big pictures to give Mnet final children high rank ^^
=
Minnie Jackpot ,,,,,,,
=
I'm really sorry for you.
=
Fart farting ☺
=
This is Jeon So-yeon's genius ... Honestly, it's a bizarre concept. It was a powerful stage, so I thought it would be similar to Latata's concept, but at all ... I just chew it all. Soyeon listened to the rap part and thought it was really good to do this as a grotesque stage. Well, Sujin's lip and lipstick are just floating .. Feelings go crazy .. Minny sat down when she sat down. And the rainy season ... nothing to say Emotions, smoke eyes, triple beats Perfection Shuhwa was really good. It was the first time, but every time I saw another stage, I was always slack .. This stage is the first or what stage is the first ... Children's best.
=
It's all good, but suddenly rap
=
It's the first time I've seen a crazy stage and it's creepy. This stage can be a real kids legend stage. This is not really a stage for these guys. I knew this song from planning to stage production ability. I've been controversial because of the real dance skills Mi-Hyeon and Mi-yeon are all so good Live is so good The best I've always listened to the group I'm always listening to the first time Jeon So-yeon, Su-jin's facial acting is crazy I can't catch up with it. I can't catch up with this atmosphere. It's so good with this atmosphere. It's so well seen in Queendom. Mi-yeon is so pretty today.
=
I don't like to eat it, but I want you to know my heart
=
6 million us
=
I think it's a legend after seeing these things.
=
But I don't know why the real ranking is lower. If you look at the stage where the real girls did, it's a voting operation.
=
Overseas fans are also embarrassed to know that Mnet is a piece of garbage.
=
Honestly, girls are all legends, so why do you only get 1st place and 6th and 4th place?
=
Idols who break prejudice as they say, cheerful children who do everything they want to do on this occasion, idols who are not familiar with the prejudice that our country idols are called dolls in factories and foreigners I feel catharsis every time I see children's stage. This stage is also creepy to genius and just cool.
=
I hope you don't blame yourself for any problems with your production or judgment. Even if you see real hits or other reactions, you can be dissatisfied, but it's so clear and creepy that you showed your children's ability and digestive ability.
=
The other groups are not drawn to keep watching, Arrangement is done by the members and the stage composition, preparation was the hardest and facial acting was not a joke How was it fourth ???
=
No, this makes no sense;
Maybe Am Jun-young again ... get our kids back.
=
Minnie is really awesome ... No Jeon Soon ... Sujin ... No. I just think it's crazy ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I really like it so I'll be back so I'll be back ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Yes ...
=
But the first place in my heart is our children ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I really need to watch Minni direct cam.
=
Why not really No. 1?
=
The rappers are all talented at Queendom.
=
Sujin / Minnie is the best digestion of this concept .. While watching while the rainy season closed one eye shocked ㅋㅋㅋ What the hell did you do ???
Though it's the fourth place in the contest, it's the first place in my heart. ♡ Even though I'm a rookie, I'm still so good.
=
Wow, the last Soyeon expression is so scary ... Really so creepy ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㄹㅇ Night mare ~
=
I'm not a fan of the kids, but I honestly should have done this
=
How is this stage fourth place?
=
It was the most amazing and exciting stage in the Queendom stage, but I don't understand why it's fourth.
Anyway, I want to show you a better stage next time.
=
No matter how big a fan you are, you're going to pick the best stage. Oh, I'm so sad. Why the kids.
=
The reason for the 4th place is because the vocal unit scores are so big. ㅠㅠ This stage score is the 2nd place, but the vocals are 1st and 2000 points apart, so if the vocals were 1st and 2nd, I would have eaten the 1st place.
=
Ah really crazy
=
And creepy detail ringed on the fourth finger
=
Even now, this live is this live ... Rookie is amazing.
=
I love it
=
How is this fourth?
=
I don't know why, but I'm really crying.
=
No, it's unfortunate that the real special evaluation teams are mothers, so they don't have to vote for the stage. This doesn't mean that Lup didn't do it.
=
Properly ranked by children
I don't think I'm out of the 6th place in the 2nd contest What's the 4th place in the 3rd contest?
=
I'm crying ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
3:06 Mimi Sinstilner
=
0: 52-seconds was like Coreline
=
I'm only creepy in the rainy season ...?
=
What wasn't a lip-sync?
=
I love children
=
As Sujin erased her lipstick, she was absorbed in the act of anger and sadness.
High-performance performance I am impressed again by the talent and effort to realize it
=
Is it the beginning of backtracking?
=
Didn't you take a legend in a real girl group? This stage ... But how is this lower level? I don't understand ...
=
Why do you think they're fourth?
=
It's not just an idol, it's an artist ...
=
If you're going to operate Mnet,
=
Every time I see this, I'm surprised when I'm surprised that I've drawn a spider's web in my eyes ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
The people in the field said that the performance with low sitting posture was not seen well from the back, and the sujin smoke and detail were well caught in the camera, but it seemed that it was small or invisible in the auditorium. I can't believe it .. Not only in the field, but on the same day, I'd like to open the stage together and reflect the results separately on youtube and the Internet.
=
If you listen with earphones
=
No I thought this time the kids were the best ... How could this not be first place?
=
The real Queendom ranking seems to be in the taste of the audience ... all teams are good
=
The children are more popular on YouTube than on site voting. 4 million times, the first team has about 1.5 million
=
I love you
=
The real seosujin is queen. Look at me floating. I'm creepy.
=
I guess I'm crazy, I think it's really creepy
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius.
=
This stage is full of costume accessories dancers, and the stage behind the waves and thunderstorms is a must.
The original music, Pupo video, and nightmare version lyrics are slightly different.
=
Guys, you really are crazy
It's great to know which part can be digested like a rice cake, and it's great to think of this feeling.
Every time one person came out, it was creepy
It's really good to see some of my shoes, but it's really nice to see a lot of new shoes, but Minnie's new side is really good
=
My eyes are so high because of me
I thought all idol groups were great when it was Engang.
But I think it's really scary to see all the dance song rap lyrics compose arrangements are terribly good.
=
Every time I see them, I'm just crazy.
=
Minni and Sujin are cute outside the stage, but the stage turns to change. LOL Cool
=
The rainy season, my hair and lens, I'm a little blue, but it's really coming down.
=
You are the best
=
6th place and my stomach hurts a lot.
I was very determined.
Yes, you all.
+ Okay .. It's the first time I've received so much ..//
Isn't it +1? this?? ((Dead..
=
When people said they didn't like it, I thought it wasn't good compared to the contests in front of the ballad.
=
It seems that the evaluation team has gotten more popular. YouTube views tell the results of this contest. I've written more than 4.5 million comments now. It's almost 6 million combined with the full version.
=
Crazy Jeon So-yeon is a treasure. Real Spectacle monsters. Crazy Minnie. Shuhwa. Rainy.
=
* Girls are the future of idols *
=
If you say you don't like it, you're afraid to pluck it.
=
It's creepy Honestly, until Queen Queen, Soyeon thought that members had a little lack of planning and concept. In Queendom, members seem to be increasingly able to understand and express concepts. So-yeon knew that Sujin was good at it, but Minni seems to be a big hit.
=
I really thought that I was going to eat first place when I saw Queendom. I thought it was the first order. I'm sorry to be stupid to see them. But I didn't see other idols after that. Honestly, it doesn't make sense that it's in the lower ranks. I thought it would be second or higher even though it was low. I had a good grip on the stage, stage composition, facial expressions, and details. I don't understand why. Lol I really got creepy, but I thought Sujin was tired of the lipstick scene and the darkening part of Minnie. ...
In summary, I don't understand why it's fourth.
=
Although it wasn't the number one in the contest, it's a topical and overwhelming number one among the public.
=
The other concept team just tells you there's a story, and this stage looks too bold ...
=
At first, children feel different .. Other group stages are like all generations.
=
If I was a child, I was 6th because of the burning of heat, and I worked very hard.
=
I don't really know why they're in fourth place.
=
Unexpectedly, I'm already expecting a breakup
Shuhwa-just parting
Sujin, Ugi-Despair and Frustration
Soyeon-I'm already ruined
Minni-Who Hana
=
Minnie is really coming.
As more and more people stage back and forth, they seem to use their personality and characteristics well.
Shoe shoes, Miyeon feels cold and beautiful
Minnie is dreamy and sucking.
Sujin and Soyeon are so good at acting.
=
I don't understand that this stage came down from the self-assessment.
I can only see the checklist.
=
This is a creepy story,
At first, the yellow tape is attached as if it were a crime scene, and the ring is seen when the fourth finger of the members' left hand is seen. So there was a fiance I loved, but the fiancé was tired of a strong attachment and expressed his feelings that he hated it. Go crazy like you deny reality after killing. It also expresses that it wants to go back to the old days as the lyrics. It wears a white dress when it is wedding.
I'm just seeing stories .. I like horror stories so I'm watching them all the time.
=
It's ridiculous that this is the fourth place. Cheer up! The first place in my heart is children.
=
This time, I thought it would be hard to win the first place, but I expected the third place .. But I'm sure that I only watch children on YouTube.
=
It's too bad that I didn't have first place.
=
This is fourth place.
=
This is the fourth place 얔 ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's a Amnets game.
=
The monsters that Cube created ... Look at the concept ... Creepy ...
=
How can this be the fourth place? The number of views is also many times higher than other teams, so I thought it would be number one or number two ... ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's really addictive .. When I think about it, when I study, it's all in my head
=
This is the fourth place ...
=
This is the 4th place
=
It's a bit of a high rapper Vincian.
=
This is 4th place, this stage is 4th place
=
Why is it fourth place?
=
I think I was pushed back because of the unit stage.
The fourth place is never ...
=
Please try some shoes at 4:22 seconds
=
If you look at this
=
3:06 = my expression
=
I saw the kids at school for a while, but it was apaia and it's a bizarre or spooky part of the Japanese stone.
=
4th? Nonsense..
=
Tell someone you don't like it. I keep hearing in my head
=
legend
=
But looking at it, Shu Hwarang and Mi Yeon look like Janghwa Honyeon and Honyeon, which I thought was pretty.
=
Mimi reaction I think it's not my meme when I try to catch one shot.
=
Mnet too
03:06
=
Do you say no? I say good
=
Stage acting is really good. Min? I think I've left my arms stretched out and lipstick removed .. Legend scenes seemed to have been counted. ㅋㅋ Songs and perforations themselves were minor in the contest, but I was sorry in the rankings. It's like a metaphorical version of the song.
=
Back dancers are also empathetic properly .. Different facial expressions. Some people look mad. Some people look so sad. Children and back dancers.
=
I can't believe you're a rookie ...
=
Children pioneer the path of being children rather than being second
=
6th place and a knife. I'm abandoned by a man.
The concept is unique among the girl groups.
My mouth is bitter because I'm surprised ~
=
Why is this fourth?
Do you want me to play the game
Oh my girl is the first to admit
Why is Mamamu second?
Oh my girl and the kids are going to win first and second place ;;;
=
Anger is like this in sadness. It's so creepy at the end that three people express sadness and three others express anger.
=
This is not first place
It makes no sense This is first place Children are first place Children are the best
=
I was so stunned because I saw one of the rainy season's eyes unfolded, so I was stunned.
=
Children Contest Hits
1st contest LATATA-11.7 million
Second Contest Fire-12.96 million
Say No to Third Round Contest-4.45 million
Even if the rank is low, the children are already recognized.
=
It's more of a story plan. Everybody's left hand ringing, he's wearing a ring.
So-yeon rap part in the middle Even if you do this, this part of the gesture is like a stabbing heart, and the bizarre men's gestures that follow indicate a joint or post-stiffness of a dead person.
If you look at the costumes, the dress is reminiscent of the dress. The original white dress turned blood red and turned red.
I can't believe the feeling that killed my fiancé-> madness-> ecstasy Emotional lines can be seen if you focus on the smoke You can see the end of the laughter, I love you enough to kill me
=
I gave the queen singers a very small fee, and the singer was responsible for all the cost of the song arrangement and stage preparation. Please pay a fair fee.
Please give youtube profit to the singer please !!!!
=
If you look at the number of views ㄹ ㅇ 1st and 2 senses, why the .. ???? Can't you give an additional number of YouTube views?
=
I'm worried that the voting scores will be great because the special voting teams are older women.
=
I know that idols are not anyone
I have to be born.
=
Seems to be better at foreign than in Korea first.
=
So Yeon is great and the members who are good at their planning skills are amazing. Trying out various genres that are not easy to try is unique.
=
Have you seen anyone on stage like this? Really crazy Jeon So Yeon You're a genius
=
Jeon So-yeon is also a genius who plans this, but the children expressing the feelings that Jeon So-yeon wants are more than just the geniuses, so many people said that they would like to be back in Melmu and Mama after the Queen. It wasn't that I did not participate in the Queen's War, and it wasn't much lower than other groups, but why couldn't Mama appear ... I'm sorry to know that I'm sorry but I want to be recognized and loved by many people.
=
No girls are cool but back dancers are cool
=
Please give me a stage at the awards ceremony. I don't care if it's the same as what I did in Queendom.
=
If it was me, it would be frustrating if I could record legends on each stage, but if the ranking couldn't go below the lower ones, I'll grind them up as I go up.
=
Stage where the title of this contest shows Queendom
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius who will appear once every 10 years in the idol world
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius, and the children just feel like they've just pioneered a new genre. They are right to say that the real children's group is the genre. Children who make this genre and interpret it like a real one. .. best group ...
=
Oh why Melmu idiot did not call the children come to see this again ㅠㅠ We have to Ryan at the children award ceremony ㅠㅠ
=
When Minni raises the sound of cheers, she raises the sound and creepy when singing ...
=
Real part distribution seems to be crazy It's not a part of one person, but each part is a killing part
=
I told you to do it. Who said the kingdom?
=
The best stage of 2019
=
If you make it bigger at the time of Melmu or Mama, you'll be harassed. I'm not a fan. I'm already curious about children's stages
=
Queendom quality was saved by children
From the beginning, I was encouraged by other idols
=
Looking at this stage alone, the level of the existing girls group is different. It's just another world.
=
Lion family
Soyeon: Grandfather Grandmother Lion
Rainy season: wonderful dad lion ‍
Miyeon: A modest mother lion
Minni: Scary Big Sister Lion
Sujin: Ferocious Teen Second Sister Lion ‍♀️
Shuhwa: The youngest lion yet
=
Here is the best composer from the girl group Jeon So Yeon You're real Honestly I'm not a fan
=
I'm good because I'm good. I know they're good.
=
Idols have to leave
Wink and lovable, the company sucks the dog with a dog sucks easily and easily grabbed a few crowns ㅋㅋ children are their own personality, the company is famous for saying that the company is going to work ㅋㅋ ㅋ Such a group is a true three generations Ao ;; The kids just went to sm or jyp
=
Honestly, the views weren't already done ... It wasn't enough for the other team stages, but the kids' stage was huge. I don't know why the total votes so far have been ranked, but ... If you live scores, the children are first place.
=
Jeon So-yeon I think it's the top of the physical idols
=
Honestly, no matter who says it, the kids were the best.
=
I didn't want a real Queendom comeback show, but I was creepy in the comments that I used Queendom as my comeback show.
=
Even if children aren't first, it's first.
I have goose bumps all the time
=
They are all queens
Soyeon: Warlords like Richard the King and Alexander
Shuhwa: Joan of Arc style monarch introduced to the intro
Minnie: The Lich King (in succession to feat.
Sujin: Side stream
Rainy season: Hamba Natata beaten and awakened Simba
Miyeon: A purely noblessed perfectional monarch who has been educated and raised from the time of her queen. (Example = Elsa Lett.)
=
Why is there no mention of Sujin's last expression? I really saw what I thought .. I'm crazy.
=
To be honest, it's overwhelming to have this perfect storytelling that fits the most contested theme.
Jeon So-yeon seems to show her dignity once again in the opening performance.
=
You can never watch this video once
=
Honestly, I think the kids did best
Of course everyone was really good, but personally, this stage
Jeon So-yeon is a real scam ....
I wonder why I didn't get first.
=
Jeon So Yeon is a female queen !! When I knew the true queen reigned. I think it's really admirable and planning, I think it's amazing
=
Jeon So Yeon is scary
You're growing
It's going to grow more than gd
=
Who crowns himself, not who crowns it?
=
The lyrics are Im the queen and it is amazing that it seems to perform so that the word "Queen" itself is higher than the existing level.
In fact, the word queen exists in the first place, but the king itself is not mentioned, and "we'll show you how great it is."
=
I want to be loyal with all my strength ....... When everyone was released for the first time in Queendom, everyone sweared.
=
The real shuhua expresses the raw lion too well. Even the controversial shuhwa is so good that now the children are really perfect.
=
It makes no sense to rank children in order
=
There wasn't any bad girl song ever, and when I saw the album, it wasn't a lovely or sexy theme, but I wasn't looking at a stage called Girl Crush. I knew it, but I didn't think it would be this much. The song or whatever, the real queen, the head, the captain itself.
=
Even if I look at it, I'm crazy
=
Cube is now so don't be fooled by Soyeon's money.
=
I'm not interested in idols, but children Lion is very addictive.
=
Shaman, Jungle, Horror Movie, Medieval Queen ... The concept artisans were children.
=
Personally, I think that Shu was really good. I started with shoes, and the middle part was really good. The other members did well, but the shoes were really shocking. In fact, I always thought it was a bit awkward. Let's marry me
=
Are children really revolutionary? Lion's intuition at least once before death
=
When I looked at the stage, the stage composition or the performance of the atmosphere was like the first place .. Real musical, but it seemed to be seen .. Drooling Spring .. It didn't mean that other idols didn't do it.
=
Personally, I thought this was a great stage that best matched the title of Queendom.
=
Really, only bulletproof Septin Wanna One. One day, after seeing the quantums, fans fanned Real, I'm so crazy ... I can't really express it. This is a floating group.
=
The children had forgotten that they showed high grades from the beginning of the competition, but they have only debuted for a year and a half since they debuted. The quality of the stage is amazing and Jeon So-yeon is 98 years old.
=
The obvious braids have kicked their tongues
The applause you get after doing it
It's more spicy
I tasted it and now I can't deny it
I ’m a queen
=
In fact, female idols wear a fluttering vinyl-like lace dress
Maybe it was what the king wanted to do.
=
It seems that it is important to have a real talent in this situation.
=
The little girl you laughed at grew up to become a lion and came to the throne. It was really a god to have Shu Hwa as the main character.
=
Will you do it in Mama?
Give children 30 minutes
3 minutes
Mom is waiting for you ^^
=
Cube should bow to So-yeon
=
Yes, Korea is too narrow to accommodate you. Let's go to the world
=
The best idol stage I've ever seen personally ... My best love stage was amazing. Maybe something new. This is more awesome
=
Honestly, after seeing the children's stage, I can't see the other team's stage. The children's stage is overwhelming ... Probably not just concept, but also storytelling.
=
Shuhua is like a girl king in a real story. I see why you did it. Sujin feels a bit poisonous and sexy Cleopatra. Something might have risen to the throne. The rainy season is like a tribal chief over the grasslands, and Minni is like an ambitious king who goes to conquer other countries. Mi-yeon is an elegant and stately queen with only an elite course in her palace. So-yeon was born as an illegitimate child of the emperor, was abandoned when he was a child, and it seemed to come to usurp the emperor. The bottom line is this song is awesome
=
Wow ... But the real kids are the kids, but the dancers aren't ordinary ... The concentration on the stage and the empathy are like the real female warriors.
=
I think I'm going to be a girl. Lattata Ryan is a legend.
=
I'll pretend I don't know Come back to this song
=
For the first time, I looked for a girl idol stage.
=
I don't know how many times I've watched this video. Please try again on stage at the end of the year. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Please don't give this one more at the awards ceremony, but everyone really needs to know. Thousands of children ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Please do it again at this awards ceremony ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Refrain English message that I really want to say "I'm Queen", but if you usually make up Minnie and Miyeon rainy season. This part distribution completes the theme of the song "Queen" for all six. Once again, I feel the genius of Jeon So-yeon.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a millennial stone ...
=
I felt like watching a musical, but at first I wasn't looking at girls.
=
Jeon So-yeon ㄹㅇ Smart use of Queendom properly .. Soyeon, Ugi other than the other members do not know well, each of the four stages in front of the rest of the members seemed to introduce each one ㄹㅇ
=
I'm looking forward to seeing how awesome they'll be after 2, 3, 5 years.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius.
=
At last, when the dancers sit on the throne, the dancers follow like lions ..... and the feeling of a lion surrounding the throne.
=
I still wonder why Jeon went to the cube
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius. Whenever I see how I make stages and music at that age, I feel like a genius is a sample of meaning.
=
Back dancers are amazing too. From that to barefoot horns. Should I have a dance or theft? That beat is perfect.
=
Really lol Children are all Jeon So Yeon not genius ?? How do you write these songs? ;; And story, stage composition, background, part distribution, concept, song and lyrics are crazy .. Is this the first year rookie is overwhelmed ..... Last contest, even if it wasn't sixth I think the children were able to win first Anyone Jeon So-yeon Jeon Jae-go Concept Members who can make perfect fires Jeon Jae-go Shu shoes I thought I'd put it on So-yeon The best ... Sujin has always been the best on the stage Miyeon-gi Rainy Minnie I'm overwhelmed by the seats and I'm really number one for real children.
=
Honestly, the real number one was these ~
I didn't win the existing fandom number but everybody knows you're number one. I'm a fan of Oh My Girl.
Number one children
=
1st place
Decorate the stage so that each one stands out
The song is good too .. The concept is amazing .....
Real Soyeon is in the contest
Best in class
=
It's like watching a fairy tale with Oh My Girl in a secret garden and watching a movie with a lion.
=
I think the cube is exciting if it's supported like this
=
I would like to set up a separate company .. There is a competent representation! Soyeon .... ㅠ members are attractive each and Soyeon is really a fan or the public know how to feel creepy and fresh, something is expected to disappoint as higher expectations But keep coming. Children. I feel like this.
=
This is the best girl group I've ever seen
=
If you are not first, who is first ... No.
=
Honestly, 1 day 1 Ryan video viewer Please press quietly
=
The True Winner of Queendom ♥♥
=
It's different from the idol group, which is called the 3rd big group in the big enterprise and the second group of the famous girl group. Just wonderful Idol was the first to think of going to a concert after 2NE1.
=
The youngest, only a year and a half since he debuted, stood up and said, "I am queen." I feel like I can't say anything ...
=
It's really hard to see it all the time.
=
Last month, I went to the reserve and Queen Dumbo was a girl.
=
Only the girls are alone.
=
I love real girls.
Idol is really an idol irregularity .. girls
In the real rainy season, low and pretty clear sound
It's a sizzling and explosive song and rap
Miyeon's clean and clear voice
Sujin's sexyness and facial expression.
Minni's charming, dreamy and vivid tone and tone.
Shu's vagueness, decadent beauty, pretty voice.
I don't have anything. I thought you'd be floating from uh-oh. Thank you for the real people.
=
This is a video of 50 million Koreans
=
I'm still upset that this stage is not first place ..
=
As I watched Ryan, I once again felt how great Jeon So-yeon was. The most marginalized and few parts of the shoe are completely saved, and I do not take many parts in this song. Really cool ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Back dancers are also going to suffer a lot ..
=
Honestly, if you close your eyes and bite the lion, you'll see the hits
=
Idol wasn't interested, but I'll keep seeing the stage .... It's a real stage
=
What the hell are you tired of seeing this many times?
=
It's a really big song. Children are legends. Every member is so amazing. I can't dare to evaluate it. I just can't miss anything. Hey Artist ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
ㅁㅊ What's this? Legend.
=
Miyeon is like a peppermint candy ... ㅠㅠ girl group is not a particularly noticeable vocal (especially children have a lot of bass ...) but the bass clear and refreshing ... ?? It feels like a mint scent It seems to make it cool ... I can't hear the bass like Minwoogi so much I don't listen to the vocals because I'm so interested in them but I can't get my eyes on Miyeon. There is a refreshing taste like candy
=
I think it's really insane and I'm sick to say that I'm good at all times It's hard to do it differently every day ... ㅠ It's really the first Queen in my heart is children ... ㄹ ... ... ㅠㅋ ㅋㅋㅠㅠ
=
Wow, it wasn't Shuhua at first.
=
I feel like Jeon So-yeon is a real genius
=
If this isn't the champion
=
This stage is not the first place ... How do you win this?
=
Honestly, I saw this chicken creeping up; I wasn't trying to prepare a music program, but it was appalling that I played it by myself.
=
If the children are lions, they are lions
If it's queen, it's queen.
You're a true Ryan Queen
=
The stage was really good because I could see Shuhwa's living expression ...
=
So it didn't win?
I've tremble all the time and tremble in my ear.
The only stage that made me feel so thrilled during the idol performance is G-Day's joint concert at the end of 14 years.
Really ... cool ... ....
=
These guys are really ... stage men .... blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
=
From the real singer to the back dancers to the stage, everything was perfect.
=
Jeon So-yeon must see rap once a day
=
I enjoyed listening to girls' songs, but I didn't like to listen to them.
=
If I'm not the first, I can't believe it's the best
=
Is there anyone who listens to this 1.25 times? It's really exciting and like club music.
=
Self-proclaimed. D. Children are king.
=
Even if you look at it. Manipulation. Three of the children's contests have more than 10 million YouTube views, but the other groups have only one million AOA songs, but the children are not first.
=
It's the best than any other stage. Really like other broadcasting stages.
=
You have to pay 70 million won
Haha
=
Personally, I think it's the only group that has surpassed the sound source. It's perfect without missing any outfits, makeup, or parts distribution from Ste.
=
I don't have enough shoes in music broadcasting
The presence of Queendom comes out
Well done Queendom
=
The only idol I sing is the real song
=
article
The number of times is going to be similar to Mnet subscribers. Why did you not invite Mnet Mama?
=
Are there any groups who dare to express such diverse and uncommon concepts among female idols? ... ㅠㅠ Amazing Children ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's a real legend stage
=
Honestly, I keep humming after the end of Queendom.
=
No matter how many times I see the creepy itself .. Is there a girl group to make such a big stage in idol history .. ??
=
I honestly think it's number one, it's stage ripple, performance, story, it's much cooler than other teams, and it's not all from one person, it's a song and a stage idea, and this is the girl group that made its debut last year; ;
=
I think this legend stage should be done once again in MAMA
=
When I first saw this, I ate with my brother at home and said, "Yeah, Queendom children, I'm really good at this. I'll see you in spring." I turned on the computer. I can't even eat a spoonful of rice until I sit down
Shuhwa walks to the side with a very nice beat and walks down to the center of Minni from behind.
The choreography was so cool and in the middle of the dance after the shoe, it was like a Joan of Arc knight, the god of the Athenian war, and I really fell in love at this time. It was a stage imprinted about Shuhwa. Soyeon wasn't immersed in rap and Sujin expressed lion's claws. So exquisite and real claws.
I listened to Ryan's music when I first listened to the top 100. I heard it because I didn't know who it was and when Ryan came out, the song was so good that I stopped doing it and saw it on my phone. It was a good stage ..... the best of children
=
I was on stage but I'm emperor.
=
Ryan has the highest views in the video with Queendom Final.
=
Love and pain can't tame children. Should I see this on Corruption Mnet?
Broadcast live all over the world
=
I want a concert
=
Seeing the beginning, half passing through it, admiring the wall
=
This is the queen final legend stage.
=
101 It wasn't Leberu coming out
It's a different dimension than those
Jeon So-yeon will succeed as a producer later
I honestly knew this group was fucking
But I'm the king of the idol stage I've seen
=
I've been watching the audience, but I hope I'll continue with this song. I'm so sorry that I can only see it in Queendom. Honestly, when I just saw the live stage, I was personally overwhelmed. Was an incomparable stage.
=
This was a children's legend stage.
=
No one is unstable
The part distribution was also very visible and perfect.
At the end of the dancers it's cool to follow the kids
The last to sit on the throne ....
Chew, eat, taste, enjoy and do it all with you ... ‍♀️
=
I'm not a girl fan
Girls did best
Every team tried
When Mamamu won, "Eh eh?"
Mamamu was good too ...
=
0:28 I come to see you all the time.
=
There must be a system that cubes are doing well, but it's good to see children.
=
Every time I see Sujin, I feel Hyuna.
=
Real kids look like real winners ...
Honestly, I didn't know the group of children, but I couldn't imagine this amazing.
=
So-yeon Jeon: Beethoven
Beethoven: No I'm Jeon Soon from Germany
=
This stage was just as good as mv ... So perfect ㅠ Whenever I want to see you come in to see me.
=
Everybody knows
What this team did best
=
It's a legend here, but it would be cool if I personally appear at mma2019.
=
This was a real class
=
The other teams are like the end of the year-end special program, but if they are gorgeous, they will feel like a different world or performing arts.
=
I'm so happy that I'm a girl fan. I love it so much more now
=
In the meantime, So-yeon was stuck with Supa, so I put some parts in here.
=
I don't see this pro, but this stage is so cool.
=
I can't express it. Really I feel like watching a musical on the other side. Just be king No Emperor No Just let's go to world conquest
=
You can't have children in your mom
=
The children of the name sit on their own throne
=
Shuhwa ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
I love you ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I think I will
=
Song lyrics kills real
=
Treasure of Cube and Treasure of Korea
=
Who's winning these guys? They don't crown them, they're already crowned themselves.
=
Real stage creepy ...
=
It's been a long time since I've listened to idols and thrilled for almost a year ....... They have a lot of stage storytelling skills.I don't care.I'm not interested in Queendom YouTube. I'm a genius, I'm a genius, I'm a genius
=
Why are you singing so well?
=
The children are not the queen or the king, but the emperor Jeon So-yeon's female queen and other members walk out and feel like I'm stepping on my heart ...
=
4:04 ~ 4:12 My favorite part
=
The group that showed the most thrilling and unthinkable stage while watching the Queendom stage is definitely children.
I thought this stage was like a musical all the time, but the more children see the stage, the more storytelling is on the stage.
I really thought all the members were kings of different feelings, and it was just perfect to sit down on the throne and look down.
I really want to kneel;
=
The cube did a good debut
=
Sujin is authentic, Soyeon is rough, and the rainy season is a lion.
=
Wow, I don't have a chivalry and I think I'm watching a musical.
=
Shoe concept is really creepy
And the middle lion crying
Ah it's just creepy
=
Jeon So-yeon look acting look.
=
Jun nice. Perfect.
=
The real president of the cube has to say hello to Soyeon three times a day ... I really can't do anything else but I want to support my children's ankles.
=
I'm only tired of seeing and seeing this in the Queen's stage.
=
I hope all the Queen performers are good and all good, and I honestly doubted how girls were not number one.
=
The other singers were as good as the final song
Mamamu, Parkbom- Mamamu was Mamamu. Parkbom felt springy.
Lovelyz, Oh My Girl-A New Direction
aoa-The song was good, but the lyrics were not good enough for the final song
But the children really wrote that this is the last song. Last really felt song before retiring. Real final feeling. Are you pouring everything? On the contrary, the other teams seemed to pour it in the second or third, and the idol felt like a final song.
=
It's a big hit. Each member is like a different queen. In particular, Minnie fights with her enemies alone in a war and wins the palace. She sings in the palace. .... It's perfect itself.
=
If you don't come back with this song, I'll go to the front office and protest ... You can't go past the stage of the award ceremony .. I can't go through this stage once.
=
(Girl) I love children ♥
=
Shu Hwa I knew how to do it well. When I was writing about why I didn't decorate on Instagram, I had a hard and firm value that was rare. When I had an issue, I noticed it.
=
Jeon So Yeon! You're good at this ~~~
=
The Legend of Legend Stage to Keep Children's History
=
So-yeon, unlike other composers, composes an image of a member's part in music.
=
If you use a lot of back dancers, the stage looks so full ...
=
It was really creepy when I saw it but I want to see it again ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I want to come here. This is !!!!!!
ㄹㅇ I draw a stroke of idol
Heungheungheungheungheungheungheung !!!!!!!
=
K-pop has made a lot of progress and certified as bulletproof.
Have you ever really listened to people who are still idols?
Each person may have a different taste, but will you ignore the idol even if you see this quality stage?
Continuing to create new genres
=
When I think of my shoe debut, I really increased a lot! Let's go more children!
=
Children's rankings will show you. You're never ranking.
=
Cube, Grain, Give it one more time at the award ceremony.
=
Ah, it's really inevitable, but it's too bad
I really didn't know it until I saw Queendom but it was the best song for this program
=
Jeon So-yeon, a great genius who will remain in K-pop history
=
It's one of the world's one-time stages. Won't you finish here ??? ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Really good children and the best in my heart.
=
Shu Hwa's facial expression smoke is so good
=
Jeon So-yeon is showing your hidden power to the members.
So the bottom line is that the kids are so good.
=
Are you crazy? This concept is the first time I've been born .... I can only say that it's the best. Just everything is perfect.
=
It's rainy season
=
Wow, really cool
=
It was a real scene .. The magnificence at the scene. I couldn't even do this. TT TT TT TT TT Real stage
=
The queen's crown coronation itself.
So cool
=
Real mouth is not shut .. Huge stage. Jeon So-yeon is a real genius. No. 1 in my heart unconditionally. Shu Hwa was so cool and Mi-yeon, Sujin, Woo-gi, Minni are also the best. Really creepy ...
=
It's so much better than the video Why did you film it so much?
=
10 million views ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I think I'll see 2019 MAMA in 11 years .......
What did the girls do to me ........
Dong Bang Shin Ki ......
=
This year's MV, the stage is this song runner
=
How is this not the first place? I'm not a fan.
=
I'll be seen a few times ...
=
I'm going to be scared Jeon Soyeon ;; Girl idol stage planning real thing
=
The rainy season is so cute and Miyeon is so beautiful and she sings well, but it's strange not to talk about it ...
=
It was a stage of the legendary class.
=
Narration Minnie voice is good
=
To be honest, the final stage was the best for the kids.
=
At first, when I saw children, I thought Jeon So-yeon was so unique and Sujin wasn't the only support member, but now I just ... Queen ... 6 lions. It's really nice to see. It's amazing.
=
Jeon So Yeon is so cool
Wrote a song? Wow...
=
Still coming in? I'm out today
=
In recent years, not only female idols, but also idols have developed this concept, or is it a group that has once again expanded the limits of the idol concept?
=
Look like a movie
=
In the beginning, a little girl sent her youngest Shuhua to poison because she became king.
=
Later, the cube should be reserved for Jeon So-yeon.
=
You really have to watch this regularly.
=
Children are not i-san mass production, but idols sweating by hand. Even though I wasn't the first, I'm honestly happy that I showed people all the charms of the children and all six of them.
=
Wow I like 400,000 !! (Girls)
=
I can't think of anything but this stage ... I think the real kids were the ones.
=
Who's the No. 1?
=
It's so rainy ...
=
Idol is also an idol
=
Oh, but I don't mention the back dancers, but the real children are really good at using the back dancers.
=
6 minute finishing ...
=
See you in the end of the century
=
Jeon So-yeon comes out as Las and says that children are a group to make, but I think they know their own identity. They make legends on every stage.
=
I don't want to go to this contest program, either Mama or Gaon Chart, but I want to go to a big stage and do this stage performance as it is. I should go to the narration and the throne, and sit back.
=
The reason I'm more immersed in this stage than other stages is that the music is good, but I guess it's probably because the story and the choreographed choreographed performance were all uniform and more noticeable.
=
I think it's the first time that a group of six real people each have a lot of personality and charm. There is a wide selection of members who can lead the genre and stage performance.
Challenge spirit and perfect digestion are already veterans. Unfortunately, I showed my skills, so I think I should give a more familiar image by appearing in a popular entertainment.
It's a pity that the agency has to reduce the running and harden like a storm.
=
Honestly, you know that first place is children.
=
No ... there are no children in the melon. Oh, I'm coming out of my mom, but I'm not coming. When can I see the children's Ryan stage?
Let's make it cool again, Ryan Stage.
=
Queendom, no one else's place
=
Oh my girl is a fan
Ryan's Stage is a real dog show
I used to be Ryan Mca
One of the best idols ever seen by Ryan on a real Queendom.
=
Soyeon: There is no mercy. I'm going to get rid of you today.
Minni: Close it? Do you hold me a knife? You are behind
Rainy season: When the enemy soldiers laugh at the power of a child like that, they laugh with a knife after killing five people with a knife. box
Shuhwa: I'll kill you if you see it.
Mi-yeon: A mage of luck who kills the enemy with magic spells without blood splashes.
Sujin: Lets 10 enemies run away at once
=
I'm a real girl but I miss you so much. I'm waiting for your album.
=
The person who changed the most to this Queendom is Yeshua no matter how much you think. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Nobody who couldn't even look on the stage would sing alone and sing and tremble from the beginning of the stage.
=
I love you children ... You are the best.
Isn't the Korean stage narrow? Play in a wider space ~
=
How can I say hello to you? Must be crazy
=
Everyone seemed to be coming out really well, but the children's stage is the most creepy. ㅠㅠ Soyeon is the real jungle jungle lion recognition. TT
=
Best ever! If there is a better stage in other performances ...........
=
Jeon So-yeon If you make a wish to Jeon So-yeon, your wish will come true.
=
Suddenly I hear this song
Suddenly the lion became charming and better ♥
=
Who did you play on stage?
=
Wow I'm good at taking advantage of my hair Really 1:59
=
I finished the lyrics.
Poetic and metaphorical, not just with concept and title
So I feel like immersion is not a joke every time I play solo parts
I'm not talking about farewell love
The narratives of lions and queens are written like a big drama, so people aren't tired.
Especially the solo art of Shuhwa
The stage I always wanted to see again was always children.
=
When I look at Jeon So-yeon, I tears
=
No, this is really scary
=
Miyeon is pretty as Jeongseok
Soyeon is charismatic and pretty
Sujin is pretty girl crushed
The rainy season is pretty
Minnie is mysteriously pretty
Shu is beautifully beautiful
I love you
=
In terms of views or topics, the children should have been number one, but they couldn't be second. Queendom was wrong ... but I didn't understand the Fire 6th or the first place.
=
Girls are love ♡♡
=
Year-end class ... I want to see Ryan stage again ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Mca was good, but like other activities, I want to see a variety of outfits !!!! ㅠㅠㅠ
=
So-yeon is a very good leader for a real genius. Usually when they write their own songs, they are forced to have the most amount. I would also like to set up Nara in Maine, but So Yeon sets up other members as mains in every stage and saves them. Of course, the members who eat well are great, but if I were, I would have been in Ojoburn Maine and greeted Ojoburn. This stage was too hard. The lion is originally a maternal society. I didn't know I would see on the music stage the victorious lioness leading the crowd to the throne. If you have a conscience, take Mnet.
=
Material 걍 crazy
=
It was a stage that was focused on So-yeon Sujin every time.
=
Real children can't be expressed in language
=
Good song
=
So-yeon is the last queen to creepy all over the body
=
This is better than Mama stage this year
=
I think it's the difference between fandom. The stage with the highest number of views and topic is only the third place.
=
3:11 I'm the only one addicted to the rainy season.
=
I'm looking back a few times after the broadcast
=
The other girl group was good too, but the girls were all over the wall.
=
4:08 W. Mr. Minni hears the lion's cry, 'Crown the crown of a young lion'.
=
It's so hot!
=
Melmu, Mama, or Golden Disk, please perform the stage. John ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Please ㅠㅠ This is really too waste
=
Is this the second year of a stage act?
=
Shu Hwa seems to be a knight of right justice ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ or the goddess of justice seems to have descended on earth
=
It's the back book, but ... This is not the first place ... Both the stage and the song are good.
=
Your company will be happy to give you nothing and give you money. Don't get involved with Cube.
=
Seems to grow while real
Miyeon had the same facial expressions in any concept before. It was a smile. I couldn't show the songs as a part of singing. I was crazy about it. Shuhwa had a few parts and felt buried. I hope you're good at coming back
=
I'm
So-yeon is the female queen! When cheering Maitreya
=
Minni is charismatically crowning the young lion, and the treble part he sings is more creepy the more he hears ... The children's songs are so my taste that I keep listening to them. .. I don't really want to be a fan.
=
It's really burned out. ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㄷ ㄷㄷㄷ
=
Wow, it's so cool .... I've never seen this stage for the first time. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Lyric stage production is great.
=
Honestly, it's okay to say that everyone's first. Idol All-Time Legend to dismiss you. You're already number one in the hearts of so many people.
=
YouTube algorithm recommended and missed it ;;
The best mistake of my life ♡
=
Is this a award ceremony? It's like a musical if you do it right
=
I'm not going to be doing this stage or directing on such a shabby stage,
=
It looks like she's grown a lot because of her Queendom.
=
Ah so good why I knew this right now
=
It's really amazing. It was a habit that So-yeon was doing well when she raped in the trailer last time.
=
I love you so much
=
Gaon Chart came out!
I personally want to see the LION stage dressed up.
=
After some time, the cube won't work or give you a strange concept. If you fight for it, you'll take your name when the contract expires. So Soyeon will take out the music and direct you to the music.
=
Honestly, the back dancers also played a part .. It was too creepy when the back dancers wandered in and out of the shoe intro and Minni came back to me. It reminded me of the Lion King. Just everyone on the stage is queen.
=
Not seeing ?? Why don't you come from mom
=
5:40 You really are the best
=
Mysterious contest program that doesn't know why children aren't the first
=
I don't have a girl group with such a dynamic performance nowadays.
=
Why did you see this now?
=
After the bulletproof concerts, it's been a long time since Idol stage.
=
Creepy
=
I can't do a solo comeback show, so I'll do a solo comeback show from Ryan to Final.
=
If you look at it for a long time, girls in the girl group will grow to BTS level ..? Solka Jeon So Yeon is a genius because he is a 멱 sal hard carry, but the members who are good at catching him are ㄹ ㅇ Chin.. I think ...
=
I want them to chew on the billboard
=
3:56 I really like it
=
4:12 This is great.
=
Children are the youngest, lacking a fandom base, I think I missed the first place. But as I write and write my own compositions, I'm definitely the best in my skills, especially this stage was Top of Top. It's the only one of the Queendom Group's live stage that has earned enough recognition to be a real sword. I hope the children and Neverland will not be too disappointed. ㅠㅠ I hope that this opportunity will be known not only to the Korean market but also to the world! As far as I can see, this stage was a great stage, no matter who ranked first. Let's get more children!
=
If you look closely, you're the first hair of a yellow-haired girl who appears as the Queen of the Queen = So Yeon (Blonde Bleach)
=
Younet won it again because Amnet didn't make it
=
I think I see it once a day ㅠㅠㅠ Children are so good ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ This time it was all legendary
=
Now I'm looking at the tenth and it feels like a musical
=
Personally, it's a taste sniping that I've been working hard all the way from start to finish.
=
I'll talk about it first. I'm a normal male college student in my mid 20s, and I'm going to ask my friends and surroundings and write about how I felt.
Queendom's message is "Idol Market Call for Awakening."
Most of me and my mid 20s don't even know the names and songs of rookie idols, and when they play charts, idols are skipped like "advertisements." In fact (I'm a man, so I'm talking about a girl group), TWICE, the girl group after Red Velvet aren't interested. As the idol market became more fixed, the killing schedules of idol members who continued after TVXQ, the diet and exercise that ignored human rights, and the concept enforcement were considered. It looks like an elephant or a lion.
Oh My Girl's ranking, which maintains the existing concept as opposed to the children who destroyed the existing concept during the first contest, shows the public's reaction when he lost his self as a singer and relies on the concept given by the company. Afterwards, Oh My Girl won the game under the concept of less popular Korean music, and as a result, won first place. This would have shocked various media and idol agencies. When the company broke the proposed concept and imposed autonomy, it would have felt the "potential" of these young singers.
In order to do this, Queendom gave a hint to "Girls" and "Mamamu" who avoid the concept of the existing girl group. In conclusion, I would like to inform all the media and entertainment companies. Just as Havana, Camilla Caveyo's solo debut with Fifth Harmony, was the number one billboard, acknowledging an idol member as an artist and providing them with a place to play. The singers, vocals and dances you've chosen have a lot of potential. So try to reach that potential. I hope you've traditionally done as a singer, not an idol.
=
I can't see you on the way
=
Creepy throughout seeing; ㅅㅂ 걍 It's a huge wall Seo So-yeon Jeon So Yeon Please dress up your agency later ...... ㅠㅠㅠㅜ ㅜㅠㅠㅠ
=
Honestly, under the theme of Queendom, children are the best.
=
4:04 It's my first time seeing a real stage ... Wow ... I'm coming in. I vowed to never buy an idol album, but I'm shaking. It's really cool
=
4:49 Weak lions are trapped in us, but wild eyes are alive.
=
Shuhwa is creepy and pretty ..
=
It's so cool ... ㅠㅠ The real Queendom voting method was an old-fashioned idea, but the fans enjoyed each other affectionately because they didn't fight hard and renewed the previous generation. After a while, I'm not going to see you after a month!
=
I love you
=
? These are the kids who hold the concept so well? Last time and this song I hope it's going to go away.
=
If you look at Mnet children's mom this time, I'm going to the company
=
Jeon So-yeon ... How is a genius like that really made out of my standards?
=
Is it about a month? I can't escape ...
=
It's the first time I've ever liked all the members of a real girl group.
Queen Sojin Maltese Milk
=
It's too wasteful that this stage is a one-off.
=
If you don't do this at the end of the year, is there a real problem? Sbs mbc kbs
=
I love you sister ♡
=
It's creepy ... It's an artist rather than an idol
=
I said that I didn't like it, but I felt a lot of growth in Shuhwa. TT TT TT TT I was awkward every time I was active.
I got a lot of parts but I digested well and acted well.
Good children
=
Like Sujin's upper body when dancing? When you do choreography like wearing a crown on your head, your upper body moves alone, so your eyes are closed.
=
Oh, and Mi-yeon's unique clean tone is really good ... elegant elegance ... not to mention So-yeon, I die in the Queen Queen ... Su-jin eats the stage with her facial expression and dance line. ... It's awesome ... I'm crowning ... ...... My sister's love is rainy season with Ryan. ... Conclusion: I love you sisters
=
Most of the idol songs these days are love, farewell, and the concept of the queen who won the war.
=
When Sujin may be ferocious, the pronunciation is too good
=
What's going on in the rainy season? Why are you so cute?
If you have hair !!!!!!!! I love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
2:00 I feel like I'm a hair lion ...
=
I think I'm coming to see you dancing rather than singing.
=
The stage is a real creepy creepy sniper sniper dog
=
I'm not a fan of kids and I'm not interested in girl idols. Actually I never liked all idols from Queendom. I was so surprised than the stage. This group is so different from other groups.
It's not pretty because it looks pretty. On the stage, the aura is so well-matched with Jeon So-yeon and the members .. I'm really going to get stiff .. I can't learn it.
=
How many times have I seen this?
Children kingdom
Became a Neverland citizen
=
I don't understand why the rankings are so low that kids are pulling out everything;
=
The addict is serious ..
=
I don't really like the choreography that's going to be a bit slow after the rapid fire rap, but it's too much for Lions to feel proud of the king.
=
I think there's a genre of real kids now
I think it's the most unique of all
=
4:04 Wow, creepy Minnie, I really love you
=
These are legends on every stage
=
The other group was good at random but I think the biggest beneficiaries are the children.
=
Why am I crying every time I look at shoes?
I have received all kinds of skills since my debut, but I plug it into the center
It's like a real queen.
Who will see you in your first year of debut?
Now, next year, if I have a sound source, one music room will be ranked first in four consecutive weeks.
=
Shuhua saved him so well in the early days.
=
Wow, you haven't even had a month's worth of stage footage. ㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
It's really creepy walking to the beat of the last song
=
It was the best of all girls' stages of all time ... ... crazy.
=
Is it live? Minnie or the song is good
=
I don't understand why this song is not first;
=
When I saw this, somebody said that this stage was the biggest hit and I would prove it.
The number of views overwhelmingly ranked # 1, rising rapidly.
I'm here for a pilgrimage. Where are you?
=
Mnet make queen performers stage in mom
=
I'm crazy ㅋㅇ ㅠ ㅠ Really ㅛ ㄱㅋ ㄱㅋ ㅠ ㅠ 입 ㅠ ㅠ Minni ㅠ I love you ㅠ So Yeonah ㅠ ㅠ
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius. I am Jeon So-yeon. I live in Korea.
=
Wow .. really .. wow .. I love you soyeon ㅠㅠㅠ children ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The real concept is crazy and the songs, costumes and dancers are crazy. How did you think about the stage? I'm crazy ... I'm creepy all the time. I don't listen to idols but I listen to this song once.
=
It's been a while since I started
=
Jeon So Yeon is cool
=
This video is really addictive. I watch how many times a day. Real backup dancers are so awesome and Shu Hwa is awesome and this is not a new singer but idol for years. It's a real lion song.
=
Had 10 million shots ㅎㄷㄷ So the children only have 10 million videos, what is the ranking ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Every time I listened to this song, I made a short wok song, which was more than six minutes.
=
As if six Heavenly Idols were born,
=
I can't express this in real terms ......... I tear the stage from the ste ... I want this to be really cool. Really, yes, I'm scared. What do girls do?
=
I think they've grown up. I looked at the stage before.
=
I'm tired of listening to songs because all the girls are cute and gentle these days, but the children's songs are so good.
=
The Queendom was too small to hold the children.
=
No, obviously, I didn't like them, but why did they come to listen to their music day?
=
1:28 I started to see
=
Cube did well: pour money on the LION stage
=
2:22 4:47
Shuhwa, my face ... Look at our Shuhwa look .. I've increased so much. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Let me get out of here
=
How is this perfect stage not a championship? I went beyond the legend .. From the end to the end, every member's voice, eyes and choreography are so perfect.
=
Now, Mamma Johnber
=
It's real mom class
=
Idol singers don't like singers because they don't like it but girls are different I think it's just cool I think other girl idols should be pretty
=
I'm coming to see you all the time.
=
Isn't it wonderful to follow dancers like the king of the jungle at the end; Ariana Grande god is a woman
=
Minnie saw it again
Queen Force Upside Down
=
My life song ... I respect my real kids. I love you sisters. (Spoken: I was worried when I broke the cube while we were fighting.
=
5:21 Looked here and felt that Miyeon looked like a queen in a real movie or fairy tale.
=
The shoe was awakened.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius
=
Wy directed backdancer song Rap dance is not a joke.
=
Wow .. Queendom. This time, with children, Omar Girl.
=
No matter how bad you can see it three times a day. I feel it every time I see it, but I don't think there's any overlapping forge. The charms are completely different, the tone is completely different, the feel is different .. The concept is different and it's amazing. The six are so strong that they are one team.
=
I don't know why they're really great, but I've stayed in a low position compared to what I showed in Quintam, but it was so good that I didn't lose a scam and prepared a stage that was so high and unobtrusive. ㅋㅋ .. children are trying hard
=
Please prepare your mom
=
So Yeon is a child with a tremendous planning power. This time they're hard carry
Not only So-yeon, but the whole group was a brilliant project
=
It's the first time I've been creepy for six minutes ...
=
Someone made a song like this with a lion motif ...
=
5:27 Jo, Mi-yeon. Take my heart.
=
Children are number one in terms of YouTube views
Not many people went to see it once, but many people came to see it.
=
Please do one Ryan at the end of the year.
It's really cool and awesome
=
I hope that Soyeon will survive again. So Yeon will be hard but ㅠㅎㅎ So Yeon did not win various competitions, but she always showed off her presence with her skills and attracted attention. The first place in my mind is children!
=
I tell you that I don't like the first place in performance. Like the second place is lion.
=
The kids ... The Queen Final was a comeback show ... The background story and intro of a song that didn't even show on a crazy stage scale, and more than 5 million hits in a few days. I think I'm going to build up the authority of the genre of "kids" that can never be replaced by another artist.
=
Children's Real Stage Jeon So-yeon
=
Really good ^^ Super cool ^^
=
Shuhua, I love you crazy. I'm crazy. I'm so happy to see you. I smashed my bed. I'm sleeping on the floor.
=
This stage is a stage that will remain long in the real idol history ... I love children ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's really cool
=
Every idol song is always in the middle, and I don't like rap parts that I'm not good at, but Jeon So-yeon is the exception.
=
I think I'm really crying TT TT TT TT How is this perfect?
=
But don't try to do anything to the children in front of the cube.
=
It's all a real legend, but I can only see Shuhwa this time .. The first thing I do is to end the crouting. My skills are increasing and my eyes are as sexy as everyone else's ㅠㅠ ㅡ ㅠ ㅡ ㅠㅠ
=
Honestly, how do you win this stage .....
=
Views say everything This stage was crazy beyond the legend.
=
Lyrics written by Soyeon! Ability
=
Papapaa ~ Papapaa ~ The part is still coolest
=
I love you Sujin
=
The real kids are legends, but the back dancers are also coming. So-yeon's crawling at the end of the rap and the lion's real expression is really creepy.
=
I don't watch my idol stage
What is this ...? I'm drawn
There is no feeling of being fed up like the existing songs .. Good Good!
=
It's so cool and creepy that I'm going to cry.
=
I have goose bumps all the time I really see you
I need to reach out and become a global girl group.
These stages and performances are not done in this unfair and cowardly place. Really eat K-pop, or just eat in the world.
+ Now the # 1 real gum soaring for kids
=
How many times does this goose bump
=
The stage goes far beyond the video
=
I'm blowing my hair at this time ... I'm creepy because I saw a lion;
=
Music, Queen and other Mnet stages
If you compare all three, it feels like you've been to Queen Queen and it's so good TT TT TT TT I really do it because it's cool and the Queen's stage has pretty clothes and I gave you a lot of money and energy
=
I'm a big fan, but the kids seem to have a good time with the three concepts. The purpose of the song of the final stage of the final stage? ㅡ I know what you want to say, the costume and storytelling was good ..
=
Even the crazy back dancer is cool
It's so cool to walk around Shuhwa and Minnie.
=
How crazy are you?
=
Creepy all the time
=
It's a pity, Shiva.
=
Minnie is really crazy.
=
Minny's highlight part creepy ... 4:03
=
Good job. You're so good. You're the best. Children are the king.
=
children
=
Wow .. I really saw it.
=
Jeon So Yeon You are a genius.
To digest the Queen's stage
I saved this stage on purpose.
Perfect!
Thank you, Soyeon.
I'll never forget what I said
=
Jeon So-yeon invested in each
=
If the girls say a stage, it's a stage girl who can be explained. Thanks to the genre of possible stage girls and to always be daunting.
=
Soyeon im Rappart im
I remember Freddie Mercury when I shout a qeen
=
Wow ... it's creepy.
=
Shuhwa seems to have practiced Korean a lot.
=
I've seen him in the main room, but the audience's clutter and the expression of Park Bom are not forgotten after this stage. Park Bom's expression = My expression
=
It's so cool, it's full of tears. (Girl) We support children!
=
Ok 400,000
=
So Yeon is really great.
=
It's a musical ... (2:22) Start
=
전 소연 is not a position to belong under his or her company. It is possible to establish a company and establish a country
=
1:44 He's already overwhelmed by the way he smiles.
=
I looked at it and there are members in each group. There were only two moms in the fourth round
=
I was Jeon So-yeon. I was crying really ..... I think Queendom was too small to hold children. Every time I see the stage, I feel that I have prepared souls on all stages, but I feel that I have not been fully compensated for that effort. I could not feel the expectation or immersion that I could not feel for a long time. Thank you for making me feel this way. ♥♥ I will support you from now on!
=
Man ... I've come to see you again.
=
I was really
=
Wow ... even if you look at it, you won't get tired
=
Seriously crazy just ...
=
I'm not really interested in idols like this contest but I'm admiring this video.
=
Kim Min-ni ripped from English at the beginning, and she was so good. She's doing nothing. At least on stage today, I think that the best song for the theme of Queen and Queen is the children's stage. I really missed the rankings. I just missed the showcase .. Anyway, all the singers all worked so well and worked very hard.
Jeon So Yeon You're Queen ^^ ㅣ Bar Good words, but I'm so cool
=
This video is over 11 million
=
L watched Queendom once a day
=
Wow, I'm mad, I'm the king, I declared early, and ridiculed the girls and sewed the throne. What is a lion and So-yeon?
=
I really like Minnie Queendom.
=
I want to join the Knights of the Children's Kingdom.
=
I see Lee Young-ae in Shu Hwa ...
=
Whatever it is, the real win through the Queendom is the concept of the children's steamed story and the queen who has already swept back.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius. Of those 10 million, 200 is mine.
=
Why is there so little talk about Shu Hwa TT TT TT 4:48 This part looks like a cool, cute, adorable and brave baby lion.
=
Crazy tears come from me
=
Shoohwa, who was nervous on stage when he saw ratata, smiled brightly on stage about uh-oh, and now the facial expression is perfect.
A lot of development in a year
=
It's a legend, it's a real queen.
=
1 day (s)
=
Keep watching while creepy
=
I'm sweating my belly button
=
I think I was scared of going up high, but Ratata, uhoh, followed by MV. This time, I went up to the lift ... My sister is the top of this era.
=
Minnie treble parts creepy
=
I always admire boring idol love songs
=
Wow, I came back to see you and hit other stages ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Ratata Ryan. Everything is good.
=
And girls are creepy every time they see the stage.
=
You don't have to trust the rankings on Mnet You can see who caught the hearts of the public just by looking at YouTube views Real kids aren't a common concept, they're not tired of music
=
Jeon So Yeon is a real treasure ~ ⚡⚡
=
Sujin, are you so pretty?
=
What kind of person is Jeon So Yeon Survival Queen of this age who survived many auditions after all? It's really cool.
=
Shu is really cool.
=
Queendom jackpot ... closed the door ...
=
The real stage should be at mom.
If you don't, you'll cry in front of the cube
=
Please know how to get out of here ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ TT TT I don't know how many times I see.
=
Come see 10 times a day Legend video ...
=
Honestly, this was the best of the finals. This stage is so intensely impressed that other stages fade out of memory ...
Who thought of this concept ..... ㄹ The skills come true and the real clothes were the coolest and 1ml per performance scene scene.
In the final stage, children are the first and the winner and runner-up teams are the final group.
=
It's a musical;
=
Let's rehash it
=
I like singing and dancing well but the clothes are so memorable.
=
I feel like you've really grown a lot more .. ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Minni high-sounding crazy.
=
To have a new religion.
=
Musical watching line
=
Return of kings
=
I think the children are the first in the final stage. ㅇ .... There was no other team that didn't have any other teams (ㄹ ㅇ The final was the best). The concept went well with the creepy ㅠㅠ and it was the first time that I was frozen in real life.
=
Wow! You know Ryan? Jonah Hothorn Eats Everything
=
Why don't you call the children?
=
This stage is not the first place
=
This stage is truly a stage
The word legend is meant to be used for children, they really have to go higher
=
How good is it to be able to take the crown and take this piece off?
=
Can't you just give me more at the awards ceremony or the year-end stage?
=
Tearful
=
I was very sad because I was only once in the Queendom, but the most overwhelming video views on each stage proved the children's grip on the stage and their skills. I think it was a good opportunity to spread the genre of children. Don't be frustrated. Thank you so much. Cho Mi-yeon Kim Min-ni Seo Soo-jin Jeon So-yeon
=
Sorry for moving the camera.
=
When the first five people come out, Soyeon is in front of her sister, so she has Sujin with me behind her, and Woogi and Miyeon have been well behind her, and she's good at this time.
=
It looks like we've woven a lion well and looks like a charismatic boss
(Girls) Children
=
It's a real masterpiece to follow the last male queens. How do you think about this?
=
If you don't like it, it's not like this. Why is it the first place? This was honestly broken at the last private part of Shuhwa. . . Is it Mnet?
=
My Taekwondo Master's friend is Miyeon
=
This is really back dancers. I've turned it back many times because of the back dancers.
=
What I want to say to the girls is that after Queen Queen and the next day, when I go to school, I always go to school full of pride and thank you for making me feel proud.
=
Hull 1 hour or 2 hours ago, there were 1077 million views, now it's 1083,
=
I admit that one of the two finalists is Mamumu 1,000 times, but I don't understand and doubt that Oh My Girl went up instead of kids. The only team that didn't have any fans but was creepy was the kids stage.
I'll fix it, I only judged on the final stage. It turns out that the total scores we have accumulated have been included.
=
Sister have me
=
I'm so sorry for this song, as Jeon So-yeon said, I've been a whole class, and it's too bad that this song came out for the Queen's stage. Suhwa, which has been developing since then, finally received parts like the members and performed the center and dance from the stage stage. I think it's number one for Neverland.
+) Because I'm a Queendom, I could express something grander than the existing stages, but I'm so sorry.
=
I'm going to the army in January.
=
And views are overwhelming
=
Jeon So-yeon is a queen without worry
I can write a song and write a rap trainer
Good at English, good at dancing
Wow so cool ...
=
Jeon So-yeon, the leader, planned everything. His English name is Genius.
=
So-yeon seems to have the ability to maximize the possibilities of the members.
=
I like your queen.
=
Minnie sister Soyeon sister Woogie sister likes ~~ ♡
=
Once you see the children stage, look at the lineup.
Why are you here?
Isn't this the first place to shut up? Did
The only real thing I can't put down even if I put it on.
Queendom Stage Each team has a legend.
Lovelyz Cameo
Kids personally fire except all stage
Omgirl Destiny
etc...
I rediscover a lot
=
I've seen a lot of cool stages so far, but this is the first time I've ever thought of. It seems to have created a different world. I think there will be a welcome ceremony somewhere
=
What views are only video views,
=
No, I'm not mama and I'm a kid in the Daejeon lineup ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ
=
Came from Queendom to Queendom ...
=
Really always hits the best and the best to see the stage is not strange ranking ㅠㅠ I still do not have enough fandom firepower.
=
Hits go crazy.
=
Sujin is really pretty
=
Is this the best? Angry every time
=
It's best to be in a song
=
Oh My Girl Mamamu Children Space Girl I like Red Velvet, but I personally think children are the most anticipated and the best among the existing girl groups. Idol is the only girl group that provides the best concept and best things to show. Expect to grow into the best girl group
=
Queendom Song Michine ...
=
Shuhwa is crazy. Like a secret weapon that has been concealed so far. Like the first time in a generation girl group
=
Wow .. I can only see Jeon So-yeon. The presence is overwhelming.
=
Jeon So-yeon and the last female queen! While the look and the poses are so good that I come to see you all the time.
=
Jeon So-yeon, I like Koreans
=
This last stage animation is a bit of a child's situation.
Although they may have been criticized as Born to be Queen and rookie, it is the children who will eventually win the war.
Since the opening performance of the Queendom, Jeon So-yeon's rap lyrics have already been revealed.
"Yes, give me that crown
. That queen is me. "
In other words, the queen was already decided since the beginning of Queendom.
It is not a queen made by someone, but for themselves as a queen.
Regardless of the result of the vote, the final stage is already envisioned and prepared from the beginning of Queendom for their grand welcome and crowned victory as a queen.
I started making this song from the first contest Latata.
SWAG of Jeon So-yeon is able to match his confidence and confidence.
"She is a Lion" The stage is already over for this narration. Queendom is just chewing children.
=
Cubes are really fast for children.
=
Personally, I think you can play around the world if you bring a really unexpected piece of music before this dish.
=
This is the famous Queen's Lion stage, and I've liked it since the children's original, but I'm glad that it's becoming more popular this time. Jeon So Yeon is always great and Su Jin is really like this concept.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius, and the first place is cumulative anyway, so she thinks they won't be in the first place. I think it's a thorough plan to go out on the stage and raise the topic.
=
No, I'm just creepy watching this stage ... Chickens are really ... Oh, awesome, sisters, my sisters are coming too much.
=
Wow, this is art. I was tired of performance.
=
I like dogs, but I've run out of teeth now.
=
Shuhwa's rediscovered song
=
Not a tone ... not a face .. The concept is unique ..... composing well ..... tell me what you can't do ..... ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Jeon So-yeon is crazy.
=
The middle of the steamed lioness cry is creepy.
=
Once again I realize that Jeon So Yeon is a genius
=
Wow, this is the first time I've ever had such a great stage.
=
No, I don't know how many times I'm going to run this.
=
Honestly, you shouldn't do it in the low stage mom ??
=
Jeon So-yeon's lap alone comes from the Lion King Scar
=
Punishment of back dancers, what?
=
ㄹㅇ I don't know how many times I'm going to try, but Minni little prince part creepy all over the body no matter how many times in a row
=
Wow .. Really cool. I've been a fan of this.
=
Wow .. I like a good song.
=
If you look at the cover stages, there are some talented people who transcend the original stages. This is not satisfactory when you look at any cover stage. It's like fish is floating.
=
The best choreography song is the best
=
I like the song so much ~ ^^ Most celebrities sing a lot of farewell and love, but they go differently .... 헉
=
Can you really come on my dreamcatcher Queendom 2?
=
I'm an Oh My Girl fan, but I like this song and performance the most in the final song.
=
I cried while watching
=
The rainy season bangs are so pretty
=
I'm so cool, I tear up.
=
It looks like a musical ... The charm of each person is different so it's so nice and the expression and the stage acting is so impressive.
=
So Yeon is honestly lying-Shouldn't he be better off and praised as a G-did when he was a heartbreaker?
=
Please give me this song
=
The children are true queens Directing Songs Dance Do not miss anything and keep watching.
I always tried a new look and I think it melted to match the contest itself. This was great.
With respect to the real Jeon So-yeon.
=
Earth pusher pusher
=
I honestly saw it because of Queen's O 'My Girl, but as soon as I saw the final contest,' They are the winner '.
=
Shu finally found out how to use her face; I'm dead now. Shuhua will eat.
=
I was going to sing in Ryan Karaoke, but I paused.
because? Soyeon Rappart + Minnie Treble
=
Another team stage ㅡ oh ~
Children stage ㅡ ..............
It was so ridiculous that I stared at it.
=
How did this not go first? I'm curious to see it.
=
The big picture I've drawn since the opening is really creepy I've been creepy since I told you to release the crown. Like a growth idol
=
Michota. It's cooler than you.
=
Looking at the stage, especially the last part of the back dancers crawling and seeing the screaming intro story described really perfect on stage.
=
The shoes that have been pointed out in terms of ability in the children throughout the Queendom are put on the front and proved by their ability as if they were seen.
=
Shu Hwa was in charge of the beginning of the stage and the solo dance. The main character of the song seems to be Shu Hwa. When the little girl called herself a queen, everyone laughed at her, and she eventually won the war and won people's praise. Since the debut, people have consistently criticized Shuhua for lack of dance and lack of dance. The shoes on this stage fit perfectly well that awkwardness cannot be found. That's how Shuhwa grew up, and I think Soyeon's selection of the song's lead and introduction as Shuhwa is an excellent choice.
=
Low voice High, thin voice Characteristic voices There are many voices, so there is no time to be bored Repeating sins are all different and good ㅠㅠ
=
4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02
4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02
4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02
4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02 4:02
Minnie Treble
=
The title was Ryan, so I thought it would be wild and desert, but it was 'Welcome ceremony of Queen who came back after the war.'
=
Shuhua, walking in the end after the first bite, it's cool and it's like a lion.
=
Super cool
=
I'm impressed.
=
What is the concept with.
=
Jeon So-yeon, I'm a real cube. How many idols can I produce?
=
Legend edition
=
What is Mnet Voting? Suzaku. Since the news that Mnet picked up the kids they wanted to pick from PDU1, Moff is just a big arch company
=
Just crazy
=
In the future, lions are busy and crying.
=
I didn't tell you
1 cube not supported
2 Will other groups get buried
Pressure
Is there a reason for this?
It's just a personal guess
No matter how much I think
Was hosted by Mnet
I don't understand that you didn't show me this stage.
Who wants to see plastic pants
Really don't understand
So the lowest viewing rate
=
My standard three queen stage
Oh My Girl-Destiny
Eo-You do it
Children-Ryan
=
The organ symphony of the bells and the first to come out of the cathedral? I feel like I'm standing alone in the middle of the ruins of the ruins of the old palace, and I feel like I'm looking at the best days of the dynasty like a fantasy. I think it was the perfect match for the program itself, and I think it was the best for the program itself. It's so good that I've got a lot of overseas fans in Queen's Kingdom. I'd like to have a long time without hurting hard work.
=
genius
=
38 people in 3 seconds
=
Ha ;; Creepy
=
Jeon So-yeon was just crazy ....... Idol, not an artist .....
=
It's not like the real kids are coming out here, but it's been a while since the other group has already debuted, and it seems that there was a difference in fandom size, and the views and the music charts tell the truth.
=
When I sat down at the end of the throne, the back dancers were so appalled. Really ... The kids were really good and as soon as I saw this, it was first place.
=
Cube seems to be a luck by just having a rest period and children
=
I know why you did it with Ryan ... Lions are female hunts ....
=
When you see the lyrics to Soyeon Rappart, 'A pioneering road that no one has ever been to,' it's just like children.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius or maybe a genius.
=
Jeon So-yeon works well in foreign countries.
=
In the early days, Jeon So-yeon Carryed her, and she became more confident, and everyone on stage was no less than Jeon So-yeon's presence; Everybody has awakened
=
Children are really awesome
Really became a children fan
Minnie's treble and Soyeon really
It's pretty and cool
=
Look, this song is 3rd place ....
=
I really need to pay ... I'm unconditionally my personal Queendom first class children ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Who sees every morning ??
=
I think I'm not the queen who won the true war, but just the king.
But I think I'm going to shoot ... Sincerely cheering!
=
I love you so much, why did I know this song today? I really love .. I love you. I love you. I love you.
=
Queen story that came out of war that followed from Ste is very good.
=
I watched this stage and looked for almost all the stage videos since the debut showcase, but it seems like the real Ryan was the stage where all the members were all generations. So attractive TT TT TT TT Miyeon has been so far + tone, so this time the concept of voice and song is so good and uplifting ?? Elegance I felt the same, but the rainy season was always cute, but this time, I wasn't even thinking that it was cute while watching the stage. I went so well with Seo Sujin's face. I think it's really good to sing like a powerful chew .. And I think Jeon So-yeon is the most killing. Make-up gives me more facial expressions ... I feel like I'm up to any song and performance. I didn't play this, but this is Jeon So Yeon's heart that wins every victory. It's cool and it's the best.
=
Except for the fans, I think it's the number one ...
=
Seo soo jin shout scream seo soo jin
=
I've been to Queendom since I come to see this every day. I knew Jeon So Yeon from the time of production, and I took care even when I was unhappy, but I'm new to Jeon So Yeon, there's no way to explain it except a real genius.
Minni comes up like a queen who has really won the war, so I understand why Cleopatra
What does Sujin say? Only your mouth hurts.
The rainy season's voice is really my preference.
Miyeon looks awkward at first and I didn't notice well, but I don't know that now.
Shuhwa I always thought that I made my debut because it was always behind and there were no parts and it was just pretty but I felt that I made a lot of progress.
It's just a new girl.
=
Young crowned lions. If you leave the real Queendom, you will chew not only the idol scene but also the music scene.
=
Seosujin's real face is the best part .. I'll turn it back a few times.
=
It was a well known fact that Jeon So Yeon was a genius, but it was so nice to see the "team" of children through this broadcast, and Jeon So Yeon makes the members attractive. The team atmosphere is so good and 걍 so good I love you ♡ It's the number one in my heart!
=
I've brought back all the groups' songs since it was released last week
I think it was Ryan who remembered me
So I expected what the stage would be like, but it always shocked me more than expected.
I wish I could shock myself with better stages and songs.
=
Every time I hear a lion cry before the refrain, I get creepy ....
=
Queendom saved CJ and Mnet, who have been troubled lately due to the controversy of the Pewdu operation. Mnet has a big reward for the six teams that have worked hard.
=
Wow, it's really cool .... Lion himself ... ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Creepy ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Kids best ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It was an undeserved children's stage for Queendom. I dare to bow to seeing it for free.
=
I saw a musical ...
=
It's just a legend 걍 Legend ..........
=
Honestly, I didn't see Queendom if there were no children.
=
Oh, I just love you So-yeon ... That's awesome ... It's so cool and my idol.
=
Wow, the views are the highest
=
It's another fan, but it's really cool.
=
I cried when I saw this ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I love you ㅠㅠㅠ I fell in love with my life for the first time ㅡ ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Are you crazy?
=
I feel like watching a musical ...
=
Over 10 million views ;;; It's worth watching on stage
=
This story and concept Minnie Shuhwa.
=
After .. When will this Lionpon fall out ... ;;;;
=
I've been attracted to something since my first debut, but my eyes are complimentary TT TT TT TT TT TT TT TT
=
Whenever I really think
I don't even say it's great ...
=
Wow. The atmosphere is crazy.
=
Shu is so cool at 2:05 ...
=
The children's sister songs are always good, but there is not enough Shuhwa sister park, so I wanted to listen to the Shuhua sister song ㅠㅠ What are you doing?
=
It's really the best idol stage I've seen in six minutes.
=
It's creepy
=
Who won this
=
The other group is 100 ~ 300 and this is 1000 ...
=
No, it's a shoe that I've known for a while.
=
Each of these abilities is great and every stage of the kids they've gathered takes on legends, and Jeon So-yeon is a real genius.
=
This stage seems to have been perfect.
Most of all, I was surprised at the tremendous development of Shuhwa, which was talkless. The choreographed the song so well, and the coordination and the stage composition seemed to be all-time. As the video appeared on the intro, it seemed to be enough explanation.
Although the ranking was much lower than I thought, it was good to see the children's colors differentiated from other idols through Queendom.
=
It's the only song I've been looking for on stage after Beagirl Six Sense
=
Slightly musical feeling
=
I'm tired of the stage.
=
Yes I wanted this!
=
I'm getting tired of choreography
=
How is this not the first place? Real stage is so good .. Songs in the middle of the lions crying and Jeon So-yeon's smiling face. Real people make me crazy. Jeon So-yeon. I'm so genius. I'm so excited. So Yeon-ah. It's the best joa tt TT I don't really say that Jeon So Yeon is so good and grateful that these members are so thankful. I feel so great at us. like this...
=
It seems that the number of children gets the most views when they look up each episode.
=
Jeon So-yeon said that because of the facial expressions and motion cut-points on the stage
When I'm hidden behind before the rap stage, I'm waiting for me to move forward and I'm sure it's ready.
=
I think I'll do it at the end of the year.
=
Queendom is too narrow a stage for you
I don't think so. But you know your kids are queens that will spread to the world? Queen's children in the wide world fighting!
=
Mnet Survival It's been a lot of work lately.
=
And revolution
=
From the first part storytelling, my hair was brimming
As soon as the shoes are introduced
My hair became curly like a lion
Use my warm fur and leather on your carpet
Femdom ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
=
This stage is really a girl's victory ... So Yeon is not a real genius I've seen so many concepts for the first time. So Yeon is a member who is good at all next to Jeon Jae-go.
=
Mama please
=
Jeon So-yeon is so amazing that she put on the perfect clothes for the shoes that weren't noticed in the group.
=
Sujin? My hair looks really good
=
cool
=
I really want to do this at the Queen's end of the year.
=
Isn't the stage video cooler than the official video ... ???
=
This stage was really good for the real children, but it seems that the completion of the performance was so great that the back dancers were there. When you walked to the chair, you seemed to have saved too well as if you were taken by a real animal king from behind.
=
No, just a few hours ago, it was 9.9 million, but it's already over 10 million .... Really exaggerated and Ryan is the best song of 2019. It's regrettable to see Ryan once a day.
This stage is more than a music video.
=
The popularity ranking is meaningless right now.
A talented group that will last long without trouble or accidents. All the teams did well, but the most memorable ones are cheering for the girls!
=
In the end, in the name of the program, Queen, the queen seems to be a song that eventually declares himself. Although it wasn't the first place as a result of the broadcast itself, it is almost the only song that continues to be heard and heard after the program ends. Yes. The true queen was 'girls'.
=
Even if the SAT is ruined one day one Ryan
=
In front of Jeon So Yeon's song, put a whisper that says SYJ.
=
I see this a few times
Other teams are looking at the stage
I came back here again .....
This is tonight ...
When the other teams are watching the stage
Woo woo woo woo hae woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
=
I can't get out of here.
The most perfect
=
what? You're only welcome to the Queen's stage! Wow ~~ Seriously. Ratata, Fire and Ryan are all over 10 million!
=
Ah. Idol ... just an artist.
=
Watching work every day. Really every day
=
Minni's narration is always creepy. Ryan looks like Jeon So-yeon's gift for Yeshua.
=
In the last contest, the gel is high ... but it was a good stage.
=
Wow .. I accidentally listened to this song on the radio.
=
The song that fits the theme of Queendom. Queendom himself is a late debut, portrayed as a little girl.
=
Everybody can hear live on full cam, but Jeon So-yeon can hear live even here
=
Wow .. Real dogs are coming.
=
It is like revolutionaries who hold the throne.
=
When Minni comes to the end of the treble crying ㄹㅇ creepy ,, wow ..
=
At the end, the group that is remembered by many people is the real number one
=
It's crazy, I've expressed fantasy on stage
Queen of the sun.
Queens of the Golden Lions.
Regal cry of the rulers.
=
I'm always looking for a cute and fresh girl idol
=
Shu Hwa, stage genius. I definitely didn't do this when I was ...
=
Is it the first shoe? Of course, I thought that Soyeon or Sujin would come out, but I was surprised to see that the little girl who was ignored by everyone in front of the intro became queen.
=
Until now, the stages that are bored every stage of Shuhwa are so pretty, but the clip as an idol was 0. Who said Shu Hwa is free?
=
Originally, only lions are said to be kings, but in that sense, I think it's a bold challenge to hire Ryan.
=
The biggest beneficiaries of the Queendom are the children. The stage video is the most viewed and the public has been informed that the children are over.
=
But Jeon So Yeon really makes each one a member.
=
The dancers are so good that the kids are more single.
=
The real shoe is like a legend this time .... Jeon So Yeon is a real genius.
=
4:47 Here's the Shushu eyes. It's so amazing.
=
I look like you come every day
=
Videos you should watch periodically.
=
And the real world is cool
=
I'm just a fandom, not a queen.
=
Oh my god .. ♡
=
Time to come back to see you again and again ... ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Periodically come to watch godly
=
If I'm a back dancer, this stage would be so fun ... !!!
=
welcome. You thought it was an animal kingdom? "Neverland" is!
=
You're welcome! 999 million ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Nothing to throw away a second
=
Thank you
=
Oh, is it creepy?
=
I really love you .. ha .... ;;;;;
=
I will shoot 10 million views soon ... ♥ So cool sisters
=
I'm really tired
=
4:39 What are you doing here? It's really neat ...
=
Ahh ~ You're welcome!
=
Michota real
=
Hm ... the lion king?
=
Wow ... Soyeon ...
=
Wow really ... the children who always showed the stages of the length of the Queen's history, the talented genius Jeon So-yeon and the team members who always cooperate with each other and support all the time, always show quality that is unbelievable. It's so cool that you really prepare for each stage. Children always cheer. LION
=
999 million views true story? 999
=
Honestly, except for the pre-score, the children's stage with overwhelming quality, narrative and preparatory process is by far the first place .. It's really cool and you're crazy all the time. I think the stage to show more will be endless.
=
4:04 You are crowned with a young lion!
This part is creepy like real catharsis
It's really simba. Young lions. When you leave Queendom, the next generation of kings is you.
=
I'm crazy ... I keep saying that I'm really crazy. Each and every child is fully remembered and remembered. So-yeon Sujin Minni Woo-gi Shu-hwa Mi-yeon Each song is unique. Soyeon's ability is a treasure. Thank you Queendom. For the first time in my life, I'm going to start with what's called panning for kids.
=
I'm not a real fan but I've never left from the beginning to the end. 'Alternative guys are the first or who's the first.' Real This is a real legend.
=
I'm really good at cameras.
=
You're cool.
=
I would have been very hard to participate in the Queen as a youngest child. Thank you so much for leaving the legend stage every time and I'm so rookie that Fandom is a little smaller than other people so I can't support you so much.
=
so cool
=
If Mnet sends this to Mama
+ After all, Mnet guys ...
=
What is this rookie? 7 years minimum
=
Didn't you say that with the billboard? My peers still can't get out of the Queendom. Especially, the children's songs are converted. No matter how hard you listen, even the opening laps ;;;
=
I'm glad Jeon didn't do anything.
=
I've never seen the broadcast, and it's an attractive group song that can't help but catch the attention as I listen to it every time it flows out, stimulating my ears in the melon top bag that flows from the store meaninglessly.
=
What was it? So far, I'm really good at singing children. I'm so good at Sujin.
=
Best concept found by Soyeon's artistry
This is just the concept itself, no need to say anything else;
=
It's amazing that the 2nd year girl group has such an effect.
Looking forward to seeing more growth next time!
=
If I had real money, I would have put my kids' performances on 365 days around the world. Like a public service announcement.
=
Ratata Minni Shaman
Tired rainy season
Ryan Shuhwa personally gave me
Lion's big picture that makes the children all level up by bringing out the less talked about members
=
The song was the best of all the children's songs so far, and the performance was almost finished once again in MAMA level.
=
Soyeon is too wasteful to work as an idol.
=
It's the first spring ever
=
Phew- I went into a fantasy novel and saved a country
=
It's just the story of a couple that's crazy like a lion and a queen.
=
The members are members too, but they are cool
It means that Han River is made) Back dancer is so cool ............. I am happy ..... This is Nara ....
=
The groups that come out of Queendom aren't interested in it.
=
Recognition of all stages. Soyeon writes songs well ;; ㄷㄷㄷ ;; What's more, the stage production looks like a musical performance!
=
The members feel like coming out, and Shu Hwa was also good at all stages. So Yeon knows what's cool and what she's really good at when she makes a song with her real plan. She has a different personality.
=
It doesn't taste when I see other stages than the real Queendom stage ... There's a time limit in music broadcasts, so I'm rushing to finish the song quickly.
=
No matter who they see, it's the first place from start to finish.
=
Jeon So-yeon feels like changing one member per song
Some members really stand out in some songs
=
Come back to the next album title song Ryan ... You can pretend to listen for the first time.
=
I was amazed at the time of my real debut when the children weren't Queen, but I can't imagine how I can grow further as I can see that Queendom continues to grow as she goes back.
=
What is the number one popular video every time you broadcast Queen Queen?
=
This stage is also a big hit.
It's a seasoned stage that doesn't feel like a group that has just debuted!
But Shu Hwa seems to need a lot of practice.
=
This song is for the real Shuhwa sister ... I wasn't the first, but I'm the first in my heart. My sisters are still rookie.
=
The rate of views rising
I'm a newcomer of children, but I'm glad to know the song style and ability through the Queendom and get good things in many ways! ♥ ️ Growth potential and impact on the world has already been proved by YouTube.
=
ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I've prepared since the beginning of the Queendom I love the quality Eva ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Songs from the Queendom so far and the stage quality was so good that I had a lot of things to worry about preparing a good song Jeon Soyeon is just a genius. .. Make a company later ㅡ ㅜㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Reaction reaction jam jam ㅋㅋㄱ ㄱㄱㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ This was a legend
=
Really nice and so pretty. Real queen.
=
The stage is really crazy
=
Intro Minnie's voice is so overwhelming and good ..
=
So-yeon is a real genius
=
5:10 The tangled braids kicked their tongues
=
I feel like I've watched a 6-hour stage and a 2-hour movie
=
I have to see this every day
=
I hope you'll do it at the awards ceremony, please Melmufu ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's cool. It's been a long time.
=
Soon, you're welcome.
=
The crown of the little lion is very nice and the lion's cry behind it is really impressive.
=
It's a musical.
=
Minnie is crazy,
=
I'll be crazy, I listen to it five times a day.
=
Wow, the kids are really ant
=
4:05 I really do it 500 times a day. I love you.
=
Dedicate a lion dance
Dance to the lion ... and the meaning of the word is completely changed.
=
Good song
=
Completely new This newness seems to be a great advantage for children. Girl group always trying! I cheer for you!
=
4:50 When I first saw you
How many people can go up by themselves to lift up and get rid of it ... Besides, they express their gestures and expressions without any dynamic dance.
=
If you look at the stage, omg girls or children should have eaten first ...
=
Minnie treble climax so good creepy
=
Came to see again .......
=
It's another fan, but I think it's really cool on the stage. Particularly, people like Minni and Sujin have similar makeups. Sujin seems to be a sister because of her little bit more (?) Image, and Minnie follows her sister and feels like a younger brother with pure makeup. Of course it's my personal idea.
=
It's like the Chronicles of Narnia
=
4:04 Legend
=
Busy
0:27 Begin talking
1:16 Intro Start
2:25 Start the song
=
Wow, it was a stage suitable for the finals, as if it was appropriate to rip the stage.
=
No words are needed. Let's go billboard.
=
You're welcome soon !!
=
It's been a little over a year now since you debuted.
=
You're welcome.
=
When I walked out of Yeshu and Jeon So Yeon rap ... The legend that the length of the road remains ... ㅠㅠ
=
Wow, you're crazy. You're so crazy. You're so crazy. You're a monster. Shoe is becoming a different person.
=
I didn't understand the ranking of the children while watching the real Queendom. I'm good, I'm overwhelmed, and I'm so fond of it. And Minnie sound is crazy
=
9.9 million !!!!!!
=
Crayon Pop
Crazy addictive bosso
The lion is crying now
=
The children are starting from now on ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Opened up
=
9.8 million !!
=
Well portrayed by Real Lions and Queens
=
Whoever said anything, the most influential in Queendom was the kids.
=
The stage was so wonderful, but the back-up dancers were really creepy ... Finally, when the six children went to the throne, they followed their heads with four legs like lions .... All
=
I'm sure I got a lot of Shuhwa .... Jeon So-yeon is the best ... So this is a talented and good artist, a group member and a leader.
=
I caught my heart when Jeon So-yeon got a stone.
=
It seems like the last time I was seriously insulted by not wearing a shoe, but I was thrilled because I was thrilled because there were a lot of comments that other members were buried in Jeon So-yeon at the beginning of the group's debut. I am so happy.
=
Who would call this an idol song? On the other hand, a short, intense musical-like movie scene.
=
In order for the real kpop market to grow steadily, there must be many distinctive groups like children. Like bulletproof success in the US market with the slogan of love for yourself.
These days, all idol groups have so many dance songs that only repeat their choruses.
I hope there will be more groups like children in the future
=
Honestly, at the end of the year, you have to do it as a Queendom special stage at the end of the war.
=
Sincere song and lyrics dance visual facial expression smoke is not to say, the dancers from the stage composition Cody storytelling concept Everything seems so perfect that we cry. Too perfect stage ... Seriously, it's a wasteful stage. Please come up again.
=
Jeon So-yeon is going to succeed like real CL ...
=
I see a narrative for each member.
So-yeon-Smart dog. However, he can no longer ascend to a higher position because of his identity restrictions. In addition, the king now is a freak. A dumb, king who wastes money. Even if Soyeon advises national politics, she is busy listening and playing. So-yeon couldn't see it anymore, and she gathered supporters and made a smart coup plan. And he executes the plan straight out, eventually expelling the original king and becoming king. This song is a song that Soyeon makes a coup.
Shu Hwa-A young princess who dies quickly. The war breaks out as the nation is divided into two waves who will be the next king. Eventually, the group that supports the shoe wins. Of course, these people tried to sit as kings because Shuhwa seemed to be full. Shuhwa left formal power and tried to get real power. Shu Hwa, who was on the throne, was originally a man with many tears. However, they wake up to see their servants trying to eat them. And he is blackened and kills all his servants who have made him king. Even though she sheds tears alone in times of trouble, she acts incredibly charismatically in front of her servants. This song is singed when Shuhwa is blackened and ousted by his servants
=
Please tell me how to get out of Ryan.
=
Mamamu was in first place, but the views were chewed by the children.
=
It's not like we're going to do other teams, but the stages of other teams are just as common
I was a little more concerned about the stage of idols and girl groups, but the stage of children was just crazy.
=
1:11
She is a LION
Is this part good?
=
It's creepy no matter how many times I see it; The real kids genre is kids ... exclusive
=
The first time I saw the children in the Queendom, I was a very talented and talented team.
=
When I want to go creepy once, I watch the Queendom children's stage.
=
Shu Hwa really the young lion itself.
I feel like I'm hiding my skills just for this day ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I think this is a stage to see Shuhwa again.
No, it's not just the shoe, but I'm starting with Minni, Soyeon Sujin, Miyeon, the rainy season.
=
Why didn't this win? Is this too operation?
=
No, it's pretty if it's cool like this. Focus on performance and face.
=
In the meantime, when I saw children's stage, it was always creepy because certain members stood out, but this stage shows the whole group of children.
=
Beagirl 2ne1
The next ones are kids ... I'm really good at the stage ♡♡
=
It's good that Ryan knows more than the stage movement.
=
"Perfect itself" so cool
Children fighting !!!
=
Like a succession to the throne, a terrible and difficult war to return to the king and crown. I am the king who was like a lion. Cover my eyes, lean on my music, and cheer.
=
It is wonderful and looks great many times❤❤❤
=
5:28 Mi-yeon really looks like a king ...
=
2:51 Jeon So-yeon's face really broke
=
1 day 1 attendance ㅠㅠㅠ TTTTTT Really crazy
=
If you float this on YouTube, your hand will just be spontaneous ;;
=
Wow, nothing to say .. Every single person has an impact.
=
How many times do you watch this video?
=
Wow, really Soyeon's virtues? After the end of Miyeon's lead, he's really creepy ... soldiers who win the real war and walk proudly ....? It was all good, but personally, the stage was good in Queendom. So So Yeon went to work, and all the members went to practice.
=
Tears steamed in the growth of shoe shoe How much did you practice?
=
The rainy season is also really good
=
It's a real new stage.
=
Soyeon sister ... Let's just set up the agency ..... No.
=
The first place in my heart is children. The stage is really cool. Jeon So-yeon is a genius.
=
Lastly, the back dancers climbed up the stairs
Really cool production
=
The rainy season is so cute
=
Really cool
=
Ssam chicken Jeon So-yeon .. I've been a fan since the time of the .. I thought I'd buy it someday.
=
I feel like I've watched a movie
=
Shuhwa's All-Part Distribution? ㅠㅠ Good
=
Cover the song
I made a musical legend
=
Wow, crazy, Shuhua, crazy, real. Really lol. Wow, this is amazing. Jeon So-yeon. Real genius. Children's concept. I want to be stuffed with this. Really ..
=
Even if you see it, it's creepy ...
=
I've called Papa's part once every time, but Shoe is the best Papapa
=
3:18 Rapa ~
3:28
4:30 ㅸ ㅏ ㅸ ㅏ ㅸ ㅏ
4:40 papa ~
5:21 Very cute ~
5:29 Puapuapua ~
=
Who sprayed this video; Who is it; I have to compliment you
=
Jeon So-yeon is like a genius
=
2:28 Start the song
=
Queen watching fans fanned
=
It would have been nice if the cloak was a more flexible or lighter material.
=
I'm hit by Minni's introduction and treble.
Soyeon = Universal Cattle
Sujin's facial expressions are so scary ...
Miyeon's voice keeps hovering.
The rainy season is really good with the inner voice
Shuhua has really developed.
=
Wolshhwa has gone !!!!!!!!
=
It goes so well with Akali No Jeon Soyeon
=
Hits are crazy
=
It's really crazy. I'm crazy. I'm crazy. It's the top among female idols.
=
The kids are good too, but the dancers are crazy, especially 03:29 ..
=
Hits tell me who's the real queen
=
There are no words in the world to represent the children's stage.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius.
At the end of the year, the members who recognize and praise such leaders and digest the concept seem to shine more.
I feel like creating a brand of real children .... and .....
=
I'm not a fan of singer teams in Queendom, but when I only saw the stage, I thought the kids were the most appalling and the concept was alive.
=
Complaining that Jeon So-yeon is the ultimate king of versatility, I am already sick and look at Queendom. So Yeon-yi comes up with ideas and gives them the opinions she wants, accepts each other's opinions, and digests them in her own style. ..I can only say that children are the best ...
=
Who would have thought of starting a story for an idol song. Really unexpected start. This is the king of a true little girl. I wish I could be under those kings.
=
Now the views will tell you the impact of this stage
I couldn't breathe and I sweated my hand
I hope you don't mind the fandom ballot.
=
I liked the other of the six teams, so I fell in love with them. I think it's the group that got the most profit from the real Queendom.
=
..........
=
The only part that thinks Ryan's Queen Queen song is that it's a good thing to do on a small stage.
It would have been a bad feeling
=
Like a stage that will remain in the history of doldol
=
This is the bed
Is it the stage where you see on your knees?
=
Yeshua Shuhua, I can't believe my eyes right now Suffering to die Our precious Shuhua, aren't we?
=
No choreography, no directing, no music.
=
I've never seen an idol who's seen this concept before ...
Really cool ...... ☺☺
Children always seem to be creating and developing groups ... I have never felt so cool while taking care of them.
=
Shout out the word that I wrote like this
=
Real kids are so cool in the world. Tell me that I don't like rata fire. All Ryan's contests are first class.
=
It's a bit of a personal opinion, but I'm the king without this one. Feeling
=
Crazy concept is different
=
I'm meeting with cover dance just for Korean idol dance, but this song is so good that it's a concept song rather than a dance.
=
It's Maracle, so I voted for Oh My Girl.
Children's contests
Wow. It was a huge stage.
=
Oh oh is a new concept compared to other girl groups? It was nice to do the same thing, but Lata and Hana were not as good as they used to be, and Larata and Han were known a lot. Oh oh, it was so unfortunate that they were not known so much. However, I have more fans. The only thing is me ...
=
I'm really scared of dogs and I love dogs and I love them so much
=
I think it'll be ten million soon.
Celebrate the children ♡
=
Oh my god, it's 10M.
=
I'm just a fan and I like songs and choreography every time I was looking for the stage video, but I'm looking at the stage video ... why I'm all so good. I can't get this point. I heard the sound and started to revive the crown from the middle of the activity and it's just perfect.
=
What do you think that's that Disney movie The princess's name is Mary? Are you merry? Orange curly hair mother turns into a lion and the movie ahhhh I love you idol anyway ...
=
I hope this is done at the year-end awards ceremony
=
I've seen my mouth open all the time. I really like it.
=
This is creepy every time I see it;
=
I thought she was a different person. Really like a lion.
=
The dancers also played a part.
=
2:20 Shuhwa gait like a real lion walking.
=
2:20 I really like it here
=
I hope that you will do the same as the end of the year award ceremony ceremony ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ❤️❤️
=
The real lyrics are so good ... Rainy season.
=
The shoe was really good and the stage was so good that I tried.
=
Isn't this the championship?
=
2:28 Come on.
=
Real chorus part Miyeon's voice goes so well
=
Just make Jeon So-yeon,
=
This is the highest number of views in the final? ;;
=
Every time I see it, it's a legend
=
It's almost ten million, almost ten million
=
Stage composition choreography is the best
=
Sujin looks so good.
=
I don't like this. Honestly, I don't know why. Real perfect art itself immersed 1000000%
=
The song is really good
=
I listen to the 10 times as a basic ㅠㅠ part distribution is too good, and I've been upset because I've heard that the shoe is not good at showing up, but I'm very upset with the perfect concept. Sujin always has a great red lip and the rainy season is so good ㅠㅠ Just perfect ㅠㅠ Song Soyeon's really well praised ㅠㅠ
=
Last but not least
=
You won, it's cool, kids
=
He said he would be king at first, and he would just crown him at the end ;;
=
The children are children too, but I get sick of 1:45 back dancer
=
The best stage. Thanks to you, I have a strong spirit.
=
I don't know how many times I'll try
=
How is the stage more attractive than music music? I have to kick my tongue.
=
And it's really cool
=
It's a musical lol
=
I'll be happy.
=
10 million Gazhua
=
I felt creepy from a female idol. That Soyeon is so awesome ~~~
=
King, not queen.
=
Jeon So Yeon was so Yeon Yeon again
=
Weir Crook Amnet
=
Jeon So-yeon is sick, and the members who follow her well and always encourage Jeon So-yeon are great.
In today's meeting in Queendom, Jeon So-yeon always said that I wasn't confident but the members are good at it.
=
Sluggish
These are the queens This is the queen or who's the queen Keep on creeping
=
I'm a big fan, but for me, the first was kids.
It's perfect from storytelling to the moment you sit on your throne. Especially, at the end, it's creepy.
And unlike the other teams who received the song, So-yeon Jeon thought himself of the concept of the song, the lyrics and stage is a solid story ..
=
I can see a few twisted bands in the comments here. Do you want to see a performance that sings like a stick for 1 hour with a standing microphone?
In the beginning, Queendom never wrote the word singing competition.
=
Wow, I was surprised to see the real shoe this time. It's the first time I've been creepy watching real shoe.
=
Why is this not the first place ????
=
But the costume is pretty ... Idol styling uniforms I've seen all the uniforms, but this is the first time .... Velvet red uniform is dying.
=
9 million views Wana Cascade
=
The real children are like a god of Queendom ... This contest program or wherever you go on this magnificent stage. .... so precious ...
=
I am not Korean. Streaming music video Lion. I love you
=
There are some people who are sorry about ranking. I've found Billboard Cotyledon. It's not the kids who are going to end up in the Queendom rankings now, but the kids that are starting to watch where they will go up in the world charts later. Fandoms, please move this song to the next title ... I think it will be a group that will be forcibly exported after bulletproof.
=
It's over 100 times a minute
=
In this contest, the first place was kids.
Although the final rankings were unfortunate due to the last sixth place, the performance was very meaningful.
=
It's a very personal idea
I regret 200 percent of the comments that I hope that Jeon So-yeon will be so successful later and set up a separate agency.
I was the only one who saw Jeon So Yeon
I felt a lot like Park Jin-young
JYP is the best at making
I really like Jeon So Yeon's ability to draw women's image is very dark and excellent.
In particular, when we hear that each member is lacking, the ability to catch the best part of the member and show it as the best performance on the stage is really missing.
Whoever said, Jeon So-yeon is the first Jeon So-yeon
=
I don't swear at cubes, but every time I see children's stages, I care about the quality of the stage.
=
If you still see more than once a day hands?
=
Every single part of the members, this genius shouted at all, what is this genius? What is that genius?
=
A group that should be in three idols ..
I'm not good at my company, but I'm going to be fed groups
I don't even have a .. I hope the cube is all-in and push the children. Of course, this lion was really big but I think it will cool down for a while.
=
The girls are amazing.
Jeon So-yeon, who writes well, writes all the songs like members.
=
Queendom> Children's Title Song Stage> Listen to All the Songs of Sagrimont> lion Infinite Root.
You are king
=
Shu Hwa's look has increased a lot ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ 10 minutes please Children, please, I'm more than a real queen Ryan ,,, ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅜㅜ
=
Every time I see you, I don't understand how this isn't number one
=
Wow, the last direction. Really .. When you walk proudly in the children's chair, you crawl like a subordinate following the real queen lion.
=
I was wondering why it wasn't the first place.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real genius.
=
5:34 Soyeon opened really
=
I'm really crazy I want to say that this is great ㅠ How should I explain this ㅠㅠ Jinhja This is really the best Children are the first place Where is the first I can't explain how much Queen I know if I do not know this stage ... Children I'll know everything. Please build a real kingdom.
=
I'm so nervous
=
What should I do? Goose has grown for over 10 minutes now
=
2:00 Shuhua, I'm going to develop my hair blowing
=
Honestly, the other idols were getting better and better, especially the finals, who didn't miss out on everyone, but they were like real legends. It's not a low rank, but it wasn't a third place.
Sujin is just ... You just awesome. You're Queen. You say you don't like it in Queendom.
=
Wow;;;; It just came away; the sisters are awesome. In my heart, I'm a lion ㅠㅠ TT TT No. 1 lion ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ Woogi sister I love you completely ,,
=
Wow, awesome!
=
All six children have their own personality, and they seem to be doing their best. So, no one can miss it. One person's tone dance visual rap is clear and six people are filling the stage under the name of children.
=
No, but it's good, but if you leave it all, Minnie.
=
I keep coming to see ... This stage is a legend ...
=
I always feel it, but the dancers are really passionate.
=
I hope the video goes with this concept ㅠㅠ or this version I want to make a video ... Too wasteful concept TT
=
At the end of the rainy season, I keep thinking about Puapuapua that I followed in Minwooshu Vapp.
=
The more I saw Miyeon's bleeding was the greatest luck of her life.
It must have been very stressful, but it was more exciting to meet a good leader.
=
Come on, chew it like you eat billboard chewing gum.
=
If you wear the costumes, make-up, and stage equipment in a big place, you'll be able to chew on the stage. You can't miss it. It's so good
=
Minnie, every time I tremble, goose bumps all over my body
=
It's a real legend.
=
It feels like So-yeon has been hiding to show Shu's stormy growth on this final stage. It's really amazing.
=
2:23 Busy people
=
I've come to see it again ... it's a stage plan and it's cheap to complete the song.
=
I've seen this stage dozens of times, why are you creepy again?
=
This song seems to have been played by the dancers (?)
Shuhua look ... I'll be here.
=
It's a real stage ...
The president of the agency, who undresses and undresses to take off, must realize that the public wants to see the stage, not the exposure.
=
Scale
=
Are you trying to be real? It's not a video, it's a real legend.
=
Who's not getting out of here right now? I'll turn it ten times today
=
Jeon So-yeon is so great Jeon So-yeon is so amazing There are tens of thousands of ideas in her head
=
Overwhelmingly different views from other teams show the birth of the next generation queen.
=
I'm surprised by Jeon So-yeon's ability to write songs.
=
Minni has a huge gap in the bottom and top of the stage. Everyone is so creepy.
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius.
=
I felt it before, but Jeon So-yeon is more than a real genius.
Song rap dance facial expression smoke talent talent song composition
What if I didn't have a singer;
If you hit children as a person, Jeon Soyeon's heart level
=
The stage was children's best ... Really ...
I was a rookie with no chins compared to the performers.
It was like watching a piece of art not an idol stage every time and thrilling every time ...
=
This is the newest of the six teams, but the stage is the most gorgeous and there is no awkwardness like a veteran. Above all, the advantage is that they write their own concepts and compose their own songs. I felt different. This is a true artist
=
It's been three days since I've been turning it for dozens of times, but this stage is too daring for those who have seen children for a long time.
It's like the lyrics show what the kids are doing in Queendom.
I was a bit worried and ignored for the second year of my debut, but I am not being pushed by my seniors at all, but rather show the best quality and shocking stages and show that they can get the best at the end.
Even though I'm in the mood through the Queendom, how impressive is it to be seen by the fans and company officials who watched during their debut?
=
Overwhelming Views Children might have been top if not for a cumulative score
=
Wow...
=
It's creepy all the way
=
Jilin
=
I didn't know what it was like to be thrilled by watching the stage of the idols. The children broke the prejudice against the idols and expanded the concept. I showed you who the queen was.
=
The number one in my mind is children.
Queendom, Idol is not only in Korea.
I want to stretch out more.
=
roundly
This time, the shoe was amazing. I didn't have any shoe parts until I got out of Queendom.
=
This is the end of the game at 2:19.
=
I really messed up the obvious rhythm .. Really ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I have no words Where are the end of your children TT ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The song that says you've come back after taking out your pretty Queen's album art
=
This is a work. Is there a girl group who can represent a lion trapped inside us as a king and release it into a song? Idea Concept Singing Appears to be the only group with everything.
=
Minnie
=
No, but r stage
No, it was really the first place
I really hoped that my girl would be number one.
I wanted to see the children's stage hard.
=
You should have a real overseas vote and a video score.
The best performance in every plum looks like the best performance, and Mi-yeon is the main vocal in that visual.
=
Oh, but I'm a creepy guy who debuted last year. I don't dare imagine how much more it would get if you pile it up
=
I think Soyeon is the best among girls but Sujin is overwhelming.
=
Honestly, the popular vote is overwhelming No. 1 every stage
=
I'm from Mumune next door. Honestly, I've been clapping the children's stage since last time ...
Despite being the youngest group, I admitted to kneeling that it was a girl group that really had their own color.
=
The kids are going to be topless.
=
And it's really crazy. There are genius artists representing the field in each era, and Jeon So-yeon is in the idol field of this era. That stage composition and musical talent is crazy. The children with Jeon So-yeon are a genius team.
It's better to produce than a welcoming musical. What's this lion dance?
=
If you come to the Soyeon part behind the real members, the member part, Soyeon part will not be broken and you will see it.
=
I think this was the most impressive and the quality was amazing during the Queendom stage.
=
I followed the theme of Queendom best .. Mamamu was good, but I honestly ...
=
Soyeon Rap is so close to my ears. Real voices are so attractive.
=
Queendom ㄹㅇ (we) pro for kids ㅋㅋㅋ
=
For me this group is a real kpop queen
=
Please do one more queen version of Ryan at big awards ceremony like Mama.
=
Wyger is a concept that includes all the real stones.
=
No, I don't like it even when I'm watching the stage. The human beings are fans of other groups, so I'm jealous.
=
Let's shoot 10 million !!
=
Wow, this is a real class. The song was fresh and the choreography was so good.
=
Are you crazy? What is this quality
=
Every time I see this stage, I'm tired. I just set up a diaper factory.
=
I'm so pretty. I want to put your hair.
=
It's very fair ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Cute ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Children's true story ..... ????? A ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Idols are really cool ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Serious Warrior itself ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow, I'd like to do this at the year-end awards.
=
4:13 Is it a lion?
=
I'm not really kidding ... I think I saw a musical.
=
It's like seeing a musical ... Crazy.
=
It's cool to dance at the beginning of the shoe.
=
Oh, let's go Ryan!
=
Everyone is doing it too.
=
Real costume box really
=
This is real
=
The children have already gone to the world. With KDA .....
=
2:20 3:40 4:38 Shuhua is so pretty
=
I don't need it. This Ending Just Chewed And Swallowed Wow!
=
Hits are crazy ....
=
1:28 Intro Start
=
Song Good ㄹㅇ
=
How many times do you see?
=
Rolling Champs True Damage Stage Video
=
Minnie treble what .....
=
I won the Queendom, but it was the children who won the most.
=
Stage where you can see graceful lion gesture
Stage to announce the birth of a grand kingdom
I love you perfectly
=
It's a real fan, but I can see that the shoe has grown tremendously
Latata was also good, from the acting of the facial expressions to the snagging of the audience, but compared to the current stage seems to be much more relaxed.
I grew up in just a few months, and I'm really looking forward to my future.
=
Shaman version Ratata + Lion = 2019 Mama Absalam
=
Cube up to them and bow down.
=
Ratata, I don't think you'll ever jump on the stage.
=
It's a song that is too sad to end with contests ㅠㅠ With digital singles as Ryan, I would like to play music and replay choreography for music broadcasting.
=
Why is nobody talking about Shu Hwa in the comments? What are you gonna do?
=
The views are crazy and nothing extends from the end to the ending. I don't know any idols, but I admire my children more than Queendom, and this final stage is really great. Yes you are queen!
=
Minni high-pitched tone ... feels like a roar of joy when an ambitious lion wins the throne ...
=
Honestly, when the stage comes out without the fandom size, this is the first place unconditionally. It's the most important issue even after the end of life. This video is why it's not the first place. It's too wasteful
=
If you pass it to Cube Jeon So-yeon, it will be the third major company ..
=
I think the sound of each of these group members is so good. Every team has a unique personality, with no overlaps.
=
Girls don't overlap the stage concept with Queendom The most rookie of the six groups, but I think it's the most perfect girl group. I think that this is the true artist. Of course, I thought it would be the first place after seeing the stage scale, but since Amnet was a children rookie, it was a big problem that she didn't have the first place in the finals because she passed the sixth place last time. I would like to see the number of views and topics, but the children are unconditionally No. ㅠㅠ I love you and thank you for the children who made such a wonderful stage ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
haha
=
Listen to the cube. Let's do this once more at the end of the stage. It's too bad to do it once, so give me one more mom or melon music award,
=
It's really nice to have a lot of parts that can shine on the last stage. Shu Hwa facial acting and the stage has increased a lot .....
=
I think this song is more suited to the main character because it is Shuhwa. I was so upset as a fan because I was the most externally girl and I was not so happy on the stage, but I was proud to show the growth of lions on this stage.
=
Minnie Treble ..
=
Wow
=
This song and the concept is too wasteful to see once in Queendom ....... Please come out on other music stations ...
=
Is it because I feel like a lot of solo parts?
=
I pioneered the genre of real children ... I threw in a uniform girl idol concept
=
At first, the shielded dancers don't have black hair on their necks, but after the performance, the knees are males with black hairs on their necks. It's like a proud male lioness and a lioness escorting the queen on the edge.
=
Intro creepy
=
The Queen's narrative is created by the children. The kids who said "Yes, give me that crown" at the opening end up on their own throne.
=
Jeon Soyeon was Jeon Soyeon ~
The members looked like Jeon So-yeon and not the children, but I am a member of these children. The Queendom seemed to show the charm of each member. In My Queen, I'm Hye-ja with Oh My Girl's unique performance, but the children imprint each member's name,
=
There is a story that acts like acting like a stage, and the acting acts as if you are feeling the emotions.

This song
Let's enjoy
Let's show
Something like annie
At that moment, like a special effect, the emphasis is hard on every scene
It's so cool ..... crazy
It's not an editing video
How does it look like an effect
I can do it.
First start clothes too
Ryan dog which emphasized strength is cool
Not dirty clothes
Clothes showing strength
Ah crazy
Like a great anime opening
Cool like a moment effect ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Why children are not first
Because it's already queen
=
This group is not 2nd year, but 5 ~ 6 years old.
Besides, this is your personal vocal.
Let's do it ~~
=
Jeon So-yeon is a real monster ...
=
Queendom's ranking is not the same as produced.
=
I watched Queendom every night in the spring, but it was a chance to get into the children. I was a girl group I was interested in. I knew it was a legend .. I told him I didn't like it.
=
I'm already wearing the crown myself, but who dare to put it on
I'M A QUEEN LIKE A LION
=
The members walked by model walking I thought it was a scene I saw a lot
This is a scene where a pretty character walks in a game advertisement.
=
I didn't know that Shu Hwa was good at acting, vocals were strong, pronounced well and everything was good. ㅠㅠ ㅜ TT I always missed the part because there were few parts.
=
And I'm really watching this stage a few times; I'm tired of looking at you
=
Walking from the ending to the throne, as if worshiping
=
I was killed by a lion in an enemy soldier.
=
No Mi-yeon ㄹㅇ Princess If the costume was really white
=
After 9 million hours, you'll be 10 million
=
Buy one's facial expression
=
1:44 The dancer in front of you looks so good.
=
1:47 I like it so much
=
Shuhwa ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Really a lot increased ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I'm so pretty every time I play one song, so I'm so pretty. ♥♥
=
Girls are the best ♥ Lion
=
Oh the accompaniment is very good
=
It's the second most popular in real time.
Give me another team
Children's videos smashed in every contest
=
I've never been a genius of genius
=
Shuhua, you're really bad.
=
Lastly, the dancers are leading up ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ The head of the lion. Yes you are the lion queen. I love you guys.
=
5:17 A wild and elegant queen ...? It's too ambiguous to explain.
=
Minnie and Sujin? It's really charismatic. Let's continue to admire from 3:56.
=
Children are taking a musical in the scuba alone ;; It's too wasteful to be left alone
Please come back with this, it's a real legend stage.
=
How do you think your brain will become a rock?
=
The rainy season makeup was a bit dark
=
Addictive sugar
=
What was this at first? But the more addictive it is and the stage is so cool !! And the first part is Shuhwa and Minni parts are cool and charismatic!
=
I came to see you today, queens.
=
Zoom out with lion cry at 4:12 and rap at 5:17 I'm a Queen! When I showed you what was above you, you laughed at me.
=
Shuhwa ... you're so pretty ...
=
And it's really cool
=
The children are monster rookies ...
=
This can't be done in a one-off stage. I'll pretend we don't know.
=
Why is this not the first
=
* It's like watching the Chronicles of Narnia *
=
2:19 Shu Hwa is so cool. A little girl who came back after winning a war in narration.
=
All generations
=
Shu-hwa parts are killed by facial expressions and finished with focusing on Sujin.-Legend Children are too tired to talk about legends because there are so many legends.
=
There's no real thing to say Yes, I love you. Shuhwa, put it on the center and show me more tones.
=
Shuhua hasn't been good enough since before. Nothing like this. It's a pity to the Axler. So, I think you're going to sleep with the opening and killing part. I feel like I've been looking at my adventures before, so I don't have to trim my toenails.
=
It's a pity that the children's Queendom wasn't the best.
Even if you have a high number of views and people's interests, you may not be number one.
No but fuck ...
=
At least, I think Jeon So-yeon is the representative genius artist in the current idol version. Now known as Queendom, it is still lacking. I hope to be more known in the future.
=
I always see artist Soyeon and his muse Sujin, Minnie, Woogi, Miyeon and Shuhwa.
All the members stand out every stage and the performances envisioned by Jeon So Yeon are perfectly digested
=
Queendom finds Minny a member of the book
=
It's just ...
=
Jeon So-yeon is a genius
=
This time, I was rediscovering Shuhwa ... Until now, I thought that my visual skills were vague, but the acting on the stage seemed to improve a lot, and the dances that came out like the tomb were not able to take my eyes .... The children were so cool ㅠㅠ
=
No one minute is really cool but the dancers at the end. The setting that follows after being a lion looks really cool
=
Beginning 1:12
=
10 LION per day
=
The best children and the best back dancer. Backdancer Costumes Unique, cool, choreographed, shield-smiling, smiling, full of confidence, awesome, cool, lion-squeaky, hard-looking shoes, and stained glass. Gather all of your back dancers and show them the same, no, bigger, bigger at the year-end awards. Jeon So-yeon who made this song and made up the stage. I'm a genius artist. I'm a genius of this age. I really appreciate it.
=
The most perfect stage in Korean competition program history
=
You should see this periodically
=
Miyeon's tone is really cheap.
=
Honestly, because Miracle is not interested in the children at first, why does our kids not hit this video every day? I was ignorant. I think it was true that I was ignorant ... everything was the perfect stage, from the metaphor of Queendom to the King of the Grasslands, to the concept ... It was a few days or weeks later. The song itself was perfect, the unit score or the special evaluation score was just a disappointment. If you only evaluate this stage, the children would not have been able to be the first .... No matter how much Miracle I chew it all children c. .
=
Singing and dancing and the stage are perfect, not to mention more At the end, the dancers follow the kids
=
Directing costume Jin 짴 ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ It's a legend ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ Actually, it seems to be thrilled when I'm squeezed The target is visible Hello, I'm from the future.
=
I don't know if I see this stage many times
Minni high-pitched parts really goose creepy ..
=
Every girl's tone is honey ..
=
It's a real genius.
Wow really great
=
I hope these guys are really good
=
Wow. I admit it. You are king
The confidence expressed on stage is so cool
=
To be honest, it's the number one on stage.
=
Honestly, it was a fandom fight .. It doesn't matter the ranking. Children's stage was always the first place. Queendom is too narrow to hold you.
=
I don't have a lion king anymore, only a lion queen,
=
I think it's been a year since my debut
=
Jeon So-yeon, complete genius ..... Real genius .....
=
No really
Really impressed when I ’m a queen at 5:17
=
Oh my god
The real sister is a genius.
=
Shuhwa intro 걍 ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Cube is real
=
Cube treats Jeon So-yeon like a queen
=
Wow. This is a real legend.
=
Sujin is like a real lioness ...
=
I'm already watching this for the fifth time.
=
(Commentary comment)
=
Jeon So Yeon
=
I thought it was 1 minute, so 6 minutes
=
With real dog is cool with crazy real
=
Shu Hwa Minnipart
=
I've searched with them. They're debuting for a year ... This is a year .. I'm really looking forward to it.
=
I look at the breath ... it looks like a musical.
=
Really ... do it all of you ...,
=
2:20 just 2 minutes 20 seconds
=
Are you the same age as me?
=
4:03 ~ 4:12 Super minnie high treble
This stage is not seen at the year-end awards ceremony.
It's weird that you don't have No. 1
=
Go up with Jeon So-yeon
=
This is better than MV
=
My favorite song in Quantum
Lovelyz's cameo
Oh my girl, Destiny
Say no to girls
Ryan of the girls
=
No, it's awesome!
=
Wow
=
Please plz end of year stage ..
=
Dog
=
Do more!
=
What kind of music do you think you saw?
=
Is this an idol ...............
Artist .............. Amazing.
=
Shoe is awesome
=
And Jeon So-yeon, a real genius ... how did you think about writing an intro shoe? ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's not the first place There's a lot to say, but I don't ........ Honestly, where are the teams that showed the stage as diverse as the children?
=
This song is the center of hwa, it's a real ant.
=
I came to see you again
=
Queendom ranked first in a fandom fight
The first place in people's minds is children
Class is different from other stages.
=
If Queendom had a regular audience rating like Susuke or Shomi,
These are the first backpackers.
=
It's a real jackpot All day, the first place in real time. I'm really looking forward to it
=
I felt while watching the stage ㄹㅇ Jeon So-yeon I'm a successful concept loyalty .. How do you envision this stage and make a song?
=
Children you keep this
If running
I only have a billboard ...
I'm so good I'm confused on stage
=
Queendom has revived the custom activity clothes that were similar to the old ones at the sponsorship market and the ready-made suits.
=
I'm not a fan of children, but I'm really tired. This time I look at Shuhwa and I'm so surprised ㅠㅠ It's more shocking that this song is only for Queendom
=
I can see that the children's stage is the first place even if it's the number one on the rise.
=
I feel like I had children in the medieval world history I had learned so far.
=
In the meantime, the relatively unlit Shuhwa shines as the sole of the last stage ... This is also the meaning of the leader.
=
I love you so much Baek Hamin
=
So-yeon, thank you for being born. Thank you for making this song.
Thank you for this performance.
You are the genre of real children.
I am so thankful that you live in the same age as you. I love you
=
So you're singing at the Melon Music Awards? I believe you will.
=
It was a stage for shoes.
=
The real shoes are like the main characters, so the raps in Soyeon's rap, and the crowds quietly mention the importance of change with the gestureless figure or parts without the shoes, and no matter how much you say this time, I grew up like this and it's Queen! I feel like I'm digesting a lot of facial expressions and gestures with this feeling.
=
When I first heard, um ... This song isn't good. I found myself doing a papa ~ after 30 minutes ~ No, it's a real girl group. no
