she's not competing. she just giving us a free concert of her... this is pure art . very classic
=
can i just say this? Bom doesn't even need to win this show to prove her self. she's a QUEEN, before and now. the views, scores don't matter.
=
I can only cry because bom is alone and i know she wish her members where there
=
I think Bom is trying hard not to cry that's explained the parts that are not so stable. I mean it's even hard to talk while crying, how about singing
=
처음은 잘 몰랐는데 가면서 마이크가 소리 먹는걸 느낌
마마무 솔라 화사 옴걸 미미 승희만 봐도 마이크 문제있는거 다 아는 것 같은데 중간에 박봄이 마이크 톡톡 쳐서 문제있다고 알리고
암넷은 왜 맨날 이럴까?^^
=
She doesn't need to win, she's already a winner in our heart and she's forever a winner, a Queen. We love her forever ❤ #foreverblackjack ❤
=
마이크 테스트 제대로 해줘 엠넷;;
이러면 관객한테도 가수한테도 아까운 무대야.
제대로 된 무대를 보여줘야지 ㅠㅠ
=
아씨 불 꺼질때 딱 누가 뛰쳐나와서 마이크 바꿔주지
=
Only her that she’s 2nd generation in this competition 👑
=
The fact that she was sick and still sounded so good- now that's talent!
=
진짜 이건 너무하다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ마이크가 가사 1줄을 먹네 그냥 뒤에서 노래하시는분들 마이크중 하나만 들어서 다시불렀어도 더 높은등수 가능할텐데
=
마이크가 어떻든 음원수준의 노래를 뽑아내는 박봄의 성대도 대단하지만 저렇게 소리먹는마이크도 참 대단하다 어디서 저런마이크를 가져온거냐 구하기도 힘들듯
저렇게까지 소리 먹는 마이크 처음봄
=
Almost 10 years later and this remains as one of the best kpop songs ever.
I can’t describe the nostalgia I feel every time I listen to it.
Park Bom, thank you. BlackJack forever.
=
대부분 시간이 매우 많이 지난 핑클이나 ses를 옛 추억에 다시 모여 콘서트 해줬음 하는데 비교적 해체한지 별로 안된 2ne1을 이렇게 사람들이 그리워 한다는건 정말 한획을 그은 레전드 였다는거.....
=
박봄 가창력에 문제가 생긴건가 의아했는데 댓글 보니 마이크가 문제였나보다 ㅠㅠ 너무 아쉬움. 합창단 퍼포먼스 오졌는데. 박봄 마이크도 잘 작동했으면 감동이 더 했을텐데.
=
She doesn't need to compete, she doesn't need to win, she's already a queen and she's just there to show the rest of the teams how it's done!
=
She's in the different level, she's just standing in the stage and doing nothing but her presence say it all
=
박봄이 마이크 손가락으로 톡톡치는거로 설명하는거같은데 마이크 이상하다고ㅜㅠ
=
1:54 솔라표정 굳음
2:18 화사표정 굳음
둘다 이거 다시해야되는거 아니냐는 표정으로 심각하게 보고있음 마이크문제 바로안거같은데
=
I don't hate MNET why she didn't win and why she ranked 5th placed, but i am very thankful to them that they invite bom to participate on the survival show. Proven mnet really was trying to help bom gained her fans again and ace her to the top. The only solo artist to be in the show was really amazing and breathtaking because she is already a queen thankyou for the MC who always put bommi on the fullest and scares contender in Queendom. agodblessBoM i hope knetz will love her and support her no matter what she was definitely trying to do her 101% Best! #ThankyouMNET #ParkBom
#2NE1Forever #Bomshells #TheOneAndOnlyVocalUnique

=
갠적으로 러블리즈 좋아하는 사람인데
러블리즈가 박봄 이긴건 말도 안됀다...
박봄언니 저 이상한 마이크로 저만큼 뽑아낸게 더대단...
=
When the back doors open i thought dara, cl, minzy will appear. 😭🥰
=
음악방송위주로 하는 방송사아닌가   음향은 신경써줘야지
=
A queen doesn’t have to compete for no crown.
=
머리:어? 마이크왜이래
손:(톡톡)마이크 이상하다
성대:난 그지같은마이크에 굴하지않는다
=
하 볼때마다 마이크 때문에 너무 안타깝다 준비 많이 했을텐데 진짜 너무하네
=
nobody can sound like park bom she’s on another level
=
Am I the only one who cried at the end of the song?! Like hell! She's a legend.
=
this made me cry :((( i feel the sadness in her when she said that her performance would be great if they do that in a group (2ne1)
=
I feel like park bom is trying so hard to not cry ...
=
Almost 10 years in entertaiment Park Bom was stand solo artist and bring the name 2ne1 in the stage. I will proud she. I hope all member 2ne1 see this and i want their making comeback in queendom for suprise park bom
=
Bom don't need any special dance to capture everyone's heart. No offense to others who will dance. Just saying. Love you Bom always
=
The girl who said "are we in heaven?". yES GURL WE ARE.
=
에이 관객 수준을 뭘로 보는거야... 여태껏 보고 들은게 있는데 노래 못하는거랑 마이크 이상한거도 구별 못할 거 같아? 편집으로 떼우면 속을까봐? 🙄
=
The new generation doesn't know what the meaning of talent, all they care & know is about visual, this is the real meaning talent, i love park bom unnie, you can do it alone, pls bring back 2ne1, gambateh!!!
=
i love her so much, like everything about her is beautiful even when she speaks <3
=
been wronged, judged & unloved but proved she never deserved those. so proud of this beautiful woman. 

*everyone, Park Bom*
=
2:27 마이크 톡톡 마이크 문제 개심하네 코노 마이크보다 못한 마이크 가줘다 놓고 노래시키면 어떻하냐
=
I really love how they admire Bom and at the same time worried because Bom will perform alone.😍
Solar and other girls reaction when they notice that Bom having a mic problem.
=
관람석에있던분들 다 마이크상태보고 경악하셨을듯... 영상으로도 겁나 티나는데 현장은...
=
SHE DESERVE NUMBER 1 BUT SADELY THIS WORLD IS UNFEAR
=
why am i crying while watching this T.T
i'm not even her fan or BJ :/
i just....miss this song T.T
=
아 마이크 진짜 어디에 있던걸 주워다 쓰길래 가수 노래를 다 먹어버리냐..ㅡㅡ
=
Having goosbumps all over my body and im actually, literally crying right now. So nostalgic, i miss 2ne1 ..
=
Is it just me who is kinda hopeful that the rest of 2ne1 will come up and sing with park bom? 😭😭😭 I miss them!
=
가수에게 장비를 제대로 제공해주시기 바랍니다
=
even though she was alone without CL, Dara, & Minzy, but her charisma as a legend will never be defeated by anyone😭😭😭😭😭😭.. Who agree with me!!!! ✌🏻✌🏻😭😭
=
I love that quiet at first moment 😯 like they see their mom is other person 😂
=
today, many seems to have forgotten about park bom, i really love her
one time she was very loved, the scandal ruined everything.
i hate yg entertainment, it's like they never cared about her.
her voice is so special, i'm now watching her on queendom, so sad that she's always ranking low, her you and i performance  was a rollercoster of emotions and memories and hann was lit , i really believed she was going to rank in the top 3 (and also, stop mnet making bom looks like she's bad).
she  seems different because of the plastic surgery but her personality, talent are the same.
stop sleeping on the main vocalist of 2ne1;
support her solo career, she really deserve recognition.
she still have that powerful aura around her, that charisma and magnificent stage presence
=
나는 박봄 무대볼때마다 왜 대부분 거의 아랫순윈지 모르겠네 저 목소리로 실력으로 절대 뒤쳐질게 아닌데
=
2ne1 Should Reunite And Debut On A Good Agency I Feel Happy For Park Bom Coming Back But I Feel Sad At The Sime Time
Cause She Only Performs Alone
=
"In every song if you get Park Bom voice, it gets better"-GD 
ParkBom the legendary vocalist
=
마이크 뭐지 녹화든 뭐든 무대 전에 사전 점검 분명히 할텐데
=
Seriously i cried for tis😭 really miss the old era of kpop especially the 2 generations. Thank you Bom for singing tis again😭😭
=
She ran out of breath but damn This was soooo goooood why was she placed 5th???
=
2:27 이부분에서 마이크 툭툭 건드리는데 이상한거알고 그러는거잖아 엠넷ㅠㅠ
=
When Lee Dae Hee said : *"From LEGENDARY GIRL GROUP, 2NE1 MAIN VOCAL'S PARK BOM-ssi"* 
I'm crying😭😭😭😭 2NE1 still a legend for Korean Industry.... Do you agree?
=
No matter what happens, even when the sky is falling down, I promise you that I'll never let you go. <3
=
That give me goosebumps too. She is Diva and no one kills her. 
Support her 4ever.❤️
=
This is so amazing huhuhuhu I remember all the memories of 2ne1 huhuhuhu i miss them very very very very much!!😭😭😭😭😭
=
She's still the Best a songstress who sings with her heart and soul bommi
=
개쓰레기 마이크인데도 불구하고 존나잘부름ㅠㅠㅠ
=
You can see everyone was crying and surprised. Everyone got goosebumps and chills. Even if she didnt win, she did in our hearts.  Love you Queen<3
=
마이크 문제가 있는데도 저렇게 침착하게 끝까지 열심히 불러준 거 멋있다 언제나 응원해요 언니❣️❣️
=
When a legend appears and everyone gets teared eye. I myself am loving this. Much love to Park Bom. ❤
=
Why am I crying!!!!
I miss my Queens so much
They were and still are in a whole another level 😭😭😭
#Blackjack till I die

i didn't even realize my tears keep falling down, i dont know if this is sad or tears of happiness :( 
ughhh my childhood song. 
miss the old kpop era a lot
=
다른것들은 몰라도 가수의 능력으로 박봄을 까는인간은 ㄹㅇ 병신임.
=
How many blackjack out there??? Lets hug together...our queen is raising again. 2ne1.
=
the TALENTED GIRLGROUP'S watching a LEGENDARY DIVA singing ♥
=
Feeling strong nostalgia and my age :’)
=
Got chills and this is the first time I’m hearing this song 🤣😭❤️
=
I hate to admit it, but I watch this over and over again thousand times😭💓 
4 Millions already. You did it PARK BOM. SOLIOST OF QUEENDOM!🔥💓
=
나만 박봄 무대에 혼자 서있는거에 눈물 나는거냐
=
i got chills through my whole body, also hwasa is so right when she says this brings me back to middle school ^-^
=
This song brought me back 10years😭❤️
=
OMG I LOVE THIS PART
3:40
She's voice is so strong!!!!!
=
who else had goosebumps all through this video 😭❤️
=
Teddy Park once said, "even if you shake the whole Asia, you won't find a voice like Park bom'
=
Okay, all of her performance is a whole another level.
=
Dara, Cl, Minzy, look at our Bom, she is gorgeous and stunning 😭❤️ I wish you gals can sing with her on stage.
=
Park Bom Is so cute XD I mean every movement and just her overall is so adorable ><
=
C"mon we need 5 millions 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💚💛💙💜❤️
=
살다살다 박봄 실력으로 까이는게 존나 어이털리노...
=
Bom 😭
PARK BOM QUEEN 😍
=
Our Queen brought us a legit religious experience at the end there!  I had to pause, grab the good headphones, and replay it over and over.  Moved to tears every time.   T_^  #BlackjackForever
=
I've moved to tear already...
=
I love her so much.... 
Is it just me who's curious why the former trainies of produce x 101 here? Why are they here? Can anyone answer me?
=
BOM is trending on Melon and Naver 
#1 and #2 after this performance
=
this is making me emotional
=
Ahhh why I'm crying 😭brings back so many memories , feeling nostalgic ❤️ I miss you 2ne1 soooo....much and the chorus at 3:13 like in heaven 💞
=
Listening to Bom sings this makes one feel uplifted and blessed. She's trully a Diva!
=
When you still hoping for the Comeback of the 2ne1 💗🙏
=
i think she’s a bit nervous, but still you go Queen Bom!
=
U made me cry! Singing with so much emotions. U have so unique talents all 2ne1
=
This song brings back a lot of memories ♥😭💔
=
I never heard this song before, but i cried listening to this... This song has some feeling that touched me
=
She cried 😭❤❤❤
=
마이크 왜저래 진짜 ㅡㅡ 중간에 박봄이 마이크 툭툭 치는거 같은데도 음향 엉망
=
Always support you Bom big hug for you

Ahhh im in tear 😭
=
i miss her old voice :(
=
I remember my childhood days :> this serves as my remembrance
=
*I miss her and 2ne1 damn* 😭🖤
=
The fact that every group is captured and mesmerized by Park Bom shows how much of a legend she is.
=
Why am I teary eyed watching this??? 😭😭😭
=
her voice totally eargasm. our queen parkbom.
=
I played this on repeat for weeks when I was in high school. Nostalgiaaaa! 😭
=
the way i love her voice sm:(
=
Just imagine park bom making it to the finals and 2ne1 regroup 😭 ❤️
=
That was so amazing, I had to really try not to cry!!!!!! THE CHOIR WAS INCREDIBLE!!!!! almost took me over the edge
=
Demn! this performance makes my tears falls.
I miss the old daysssss
=
OMYG MY HEART ❤😭
=
The last time i heard this was over 8 years ago and im   crying for hearing this again😭😭
=
Finally i can hear this song again after a thousand years 😂😂😂
=
I get full body shivers whenever Bom sings, I'm so happy to see her doing so well. I get all teary eyed every time she preforms
=
So happy to see her on stage like this again after all she's been through. Happy tears.
=
The ffeels 😭😭 Park Bom is such a queen 😍
=
Crying my effing eyes out... This entire journey and the nostalgia combined just brought out all the feels 😭😭
=
This made me cry :( way to go Bom! #BlackJackForever!
=
This was sooooooooo fking sick 😭 I gonna faint from how Fire this is 🔥
=
Im crying…My Queen is comeback!!
=
Who else sang the whole song with Bom?? 😭
=
For someone who has been there since 2009, I can’t help but to get teary-eyed. For Bom being able to do this considering the backlash she received in the past, it takes a lot of courage. This might not be her best performance but this is one of the many stages she will showcase her talent from now on. We’ll continue to support Bom and the rest of our 2NE1 Queens. 💖💖💖
=
queen in queendom - bom :*
=
I think she was having mic probs theres a part she signalled and pointed at her mic
=
Fans watching must be feeling like they're in a concert because of this performanceee.
=
this song makes be cry - i remember the MV
=
thye didn't put it here but, miyeon said she was about to cry at the end
=
The perfect moment to cut onions ...
=
3:34  ...."Are we in Heaven" ...lol
=
The mems 😭😭😭😭💗
=
Oh my... 
My fav. Song from her. ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom enter this competition as solo, but brought a whole cast of choir group hahahaha, that's my queen. 

Anyway, this song never failed to make me cry, esp with Bommie's angelic vocal!! T_T

This song is damn hard to sing......the original key is way too high hahaha~~~

at 3:10 timestamp there's 3 lights focusing on Bom, signifying blessing from dara, CL, minzy T_T
=
I'm crying rn 😭
=
If 2ne1 decide to comeback as 4 member group... Even without label they will still rock the stage...
=
Wow! That’s Queen , LEGEND Level !
=
I may have just cried my eyes out
=
Just by the thought that PARK BOM (thru 2NE1) touched each of these girls' lives and somehow affected their eagerness and choice to become the great idols that they are today is just something amazing. Experience wise, Bom is already the queen of this show. Just remember how many times she was rejected by YG before finally entering the company as trainee and finally becoming a member of 2NE1. With all of the controversies she and her group had been through, she's already a queen indeed, a chunk of coal that did really well under pressure and here she is now, a diamond of KPOP. 🥰🥰🥰
=
마이크 문제였구나  난 실력이 죽은 줄 ㅜㅜ
=
let's get this one to *5M* FIGHTING!
=
I was sobbed and cried when I heard her singing in this song. I'm really glad to see Park Bom is comeback. i miss you and 2NE1 so much!! ❤️
=
Other groups are reminiscing aweee💕
=
Hope one member of 2ne1 will join her in her upcoming performances...
=
this brings back everything! i can feel that she's about to cry but she slayed! it made me cry when the crowd started singing with her, she's not alone! ilysm queen bommieee!
=
That was so emotional 😭😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
=
I cried. I'm so happy to see you singing again, Bom! 😭💖
=
We missed you Park bom😭
=
Even shes alone on the stage she knows that all her 2NE1 members and ofcoz blackjack always be with her. Unnie hwaiting!!!
=
This song always made me cry, 9 years ago till this day
=
Goosebumps. 😭 My Queen. 😭
=
Yaaas bommie unnie! I missed this song 😭
=
I LOVE PARK BOM SO MUUUUUCH! BUT ANWAYS WHO'S THAT GUY IN 3:56 COZ DAMN HE'S SO CUUUUTE!
=
most of the girls is my age. this song i frst heard when i was in highschool.  so this song probably everyone childhood song.
=
2:38 look reaction solar what do you think about this?
=
I'm so happy she deserve more my bias ❤❤❤
=
Dust inside my eyes....
=
TTvTT feeling relieve and happy when I heard this song again 😢😢 always support 2NE1😢
=
Shout out to 2nd generation fans..lets support her..😘
=
I cried. It's so amazing to hear her beautiful voice again I'm so happy she's back
=
bom blessing us with two legendary performances 😭😭😭 i love you so much bomnie ♥♥♥
=
Te amo bom ❤️😍
=
THE POWER OF PARK BOM SHE GOT EVERYONE EMOTIONAL ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I am a SONE, and all I want to say is that I hope the blackjacks give BOM all the support she deserves. A legend from a legendary group!
=
Park Bom, never stop following your damn dreams. I don’t know what would’ve been of me if I never came upon your mesmerizing voice. Even though this performance was below your standard you still managed to bring so many memories. It’s amazing how many miles differentiate us but you’ve done so much for me. Thank you my forever bias
=
박봄 오열 시키는법

봄 : You and I together it just feels alright

불 꺼짐. 

다라, 민지 : 이별이란 말은 never



채린 :  그 누가 뭐라 해도 난 그댈 지킬게 (포옹)
=
I’m gonna cry when hearing about this,I miss 2ne1 everyone
=
I love this Mariah Carey moment going on
=
It’s almost 10 years , but for me this song is still my favorite song .
=
I want to go back to the paaaaast! 😭
=
I wish Bom perform "GOODBYE" Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 😭😭😭
=
Why do I feel like MAMAMOO is rooting for Park Bom! ❤️
=
i miss 2ne1😭😂❤
=
박봄 진짜 사건사고는 많았지만 실력은 진짜 안죽었다 소름돋네 혼자무대에서도 기안죽네 그리고 엠넷 개세들 박봄한테 마이크 고장난걸주네 스벌놈들 마이크 고장났어도 라이브로 부르는것같네
=
으.. 언제나들어도 좋당
=
Forever a queen ❤ made me feel so nostalgic and emotional. I wanna go back to the early 2000 kpop times so bad 😭 (2ne1, Bigbang, 2pm, 2am, Suju, snsd, shinee, beast, mblaq, infinite, kara, afterschool, wonder girls, etc.) LEGENDS and the gateways to kpop.
=
wtf is this real her voice sounds so freaking good even on live
=
She started to sing I cried hahahaha omg
=
어이가 없다 딱 봐도 마이크 문제 너무 심한데,, 마이크 문제 직접나타날땐 관객이나 가수들 리액션으로 화면 바꿔버리면서 봄이 실력이 문제인것처럼 만들어버리네;; 진짜 살다보니까 봄이가 성량이 부족하단 소리를 듣네
=
She was about to cry oh my lord this is so pure and beautiful
=
I love this so much because it's just her raw voice and the choir.. 😭 Thank you gravely Bom-unnie for coming back to us.. BJs forever~
=
언니 진짜 내가 애정해요. 사랑해ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 언니 목소리 최곤거 알죠??ㅜㅜ💕💕
=
Remembering Early Childhood 🥺
=
솔직히 저 프로에 
박봄을 출연시키는게 이상했음
여왕님이랑 쪼꼬미들이 대결하는거 잖아..
2ne1은 진짜 여왕 그 이상이었는데...

(박봄언니 1등 할 수 있어요
화이팅!)
=
Iloveyouuunybomiiieee! I'm so proud of youuu!
=
Im crying so much oh my god
=
I cried even tho i don't know the meaning of the song :(
=
마이크 너무하네ㅜㅜ
=
마이크 문제 있는 거 맞네ㅋㅋㅋ 소리를 먹잖아 본인이 못불러서 그러는 게 아니라 지금ㅋㅋㅋ
=
ooo im crying ..it's so emotional
=
창법이 바꼈다기보다는 목소리가 어른스러워지고 발음을 좀더 굴려서 바뀐거처럼 들리는듯
=
으에이씨 눈물나와ㅜㅜㅠㅜㅜ 아 진짜 춘여사 너무 너무 보고싶엇어ㅜㅜㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠ
=
와 진짜 박봄 대단한듯ㅠㅠㅠ 좀 더 많이 떳으면ㅠㅠㅠ❤️❤️❤️
=
아니 무슨 마이크 문제 심한 거 음알못인 나도 알겠다 차라리 마이크 없이 노래부르는 게 낫겠네
=
I’m crying.My memories ❤️❤️❤️
=
Omg this is so beautiful 😍😍😍 I cried so hard 😩😭😭💙💙💙💙
=
마이크가 박봄 실력을 가렸다 ..
=
Queen park bom 👸🏻who always make me emotional🤣😂 ur such an inspiration to everyone..an angel😇We adore❤️
=
한국어댓글만 골라서 보는 필터없나..
=
i miss my queens so muchh 😭😭😭
=
Sihoon, junghwan, and seongjun😭
=
Who cried at the start of the song?
=
Omg her voice is so unique!!!
=
She is so beautiful and amazing 😍😘
=
This performance was breath taking 👏🏼
=
This song makes me miss 2ne1 more!!!😭😭😭
=
This brought me 10 years back when I started as a kpop fan.....eyes filled with tears rn😭👍👍👍
=
I cried happily for this performance and it makes me shook. Slay Queen Bom!
=
Omg gave me goosebumps made me tear up at the end too
=
I cried so much watching this. I forgot how much I love and miss all of 2ne1 together
=
omgs i really love this song
=
2:26 에 마이크 안나온다고 인이어랑 손가락으로 두들기는구만 ㅜ..
=
I really do HOPE!! Hoping someday... 2ne1 will comeback 😭😭 imissthis girl group...
The best group ever!!
=
I love her voice, very unique
=
After I listen you sing, I don't know the meaning but  why it made me want to cry
=
박봄, 노래너무 잘한다.   응원할게.  힘내😘😘😘😘😘
=
화사가 말한 중학교 때로 돌아간 것 같다는 말이 뭔지 확 와닿음 ㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 딱 저때 중학생이었는데... ㅠㅠ 진짜 향수같은 노래임 ㅠ 그냥 가사가 술술 나와 ㅠㅠ
=
Gooooosebumps at it's finest!
Singing live with an amazing choir!
You really are a queen bom!
=
I just wanna hug and give my support and tell her how much iam happy and proud of her😊. God bless her and save her from her hatreds 🙏
=
I want to cry 😭
=
How can you not cry when this song have been in your playlist since release 😭😭😭😭 my bommie
=
my queen bom ❤️
=
Our queen🙂👸🏻forever queen..we love yah❤️
=
I’m drowning in teas
=
I wish Rose (BP) and Bom could sing this together
Sorry for my bad english
=
박봄 그리 좋아하진 않았지만 마이크때문에 제 실력도 못낸다는 웃기는 상황은 생각해본적도 없다. 경쟁은 공평해야하잖아. 데뷔연차가 오래된만큼 박봄이 노래못한다는 생각은 해본적이 없는데다 솔로로 나와서 준비 많이 한 것 같은데 마이크때문에 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ화재만들어서 프로그램 홍보하고싶냐고....뒤가 더러운데 같이 경쟁하는 아이돌들이 지던 이기던 기쁘겠냐..
=
2:22 진짜 안나와서 인이어 두들기는거 보고 맴찢.
=
Someone can explain me, why does the bom's voice always give  goosebumps?  I reallly love her <3
=
2NE1 THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE WE LOVE YOU blackjack💖💖💖💖
=
She hasn't even started to sing and I'm already crying omg
=
여기 출연하는 걸그룹들 다 너무 좋아하지만 솔직히 다음 화 안 봐도 난 저 어어워~ 시작만 놓고 딱 박봄이다 싶다 다른 그룹들도 다 인정하는거 봐 팬덤 싸움 인기 싸움에 박봄 끼우지마ㅠ
=
My childhood 😭😭😭
=
I missed her so much and finally got to see this...
=
The Real QUEEN 👸
=
머리카락만  남고 얼굴이 해골이  되어도  사랑할테니 계속  노래해주세요
=
현장에선 시원시원하게 잘들렸는데 방송음향 왜그런건가요 ,, ? ㅠ 진짜 1분 1초가 다 소름의 연속이였어서 정말 영상만 기다렸는데 음향 너무 아쉬워요 😭
=
2:12 was it Baekjin? the one with red hair? From Producex101, ITS BAEKJIN TIMEEEE!! I MISS WATCHING Produce Series uwu
=
I love this song so much .... 😭
=
This song is legendary. It brings back so many memories!  It'll always be Bom's best song,  probably
=
Bom fighting, I'm very emo now
=
I’m rlly having that 0.01% of hope in me that 2NE1 will be able to use this reality show to comeback together... seeing this made me cry so bad because all the past 2NE1 memories came back and thinking about how it’s been so Long since she debuted solo with You and I, it just hurts to see her alone. Yet I’m so proud of her being so brave as the only soloist in this Reality show.

anyone that thinks the same, press that 👍🏼 button. 

Edit: Thank you guys!! once again rlly rlly hope that 2NE1 can use Queendom as a stage for their comeback performance!!! I rlly think that it’s the perfect reality show, perfect stage. Nothing Beats Queendom being their perfect stage.
=
I just need 2ne1 to reunite again 😭
=
I Love this song so much!! And the treatment they gave it! Chills
=
I’m crying😩😭😭😭😭
=
I am crying 😍❤
=
목상태고 컨디션이고 박봄이 저런 무대를 하는게 좀 슬픔... 언제나 노래 잘할 것 같았는데 뭐랄까 그냥ㅜ 그런 느낌이 있삼
=
We love you PARK BOM ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I’m cry now :((( This is we Park Bom 💕💕💕
=
Okay, I'm crying😢
=
나 이노래 너무 좋아 진짜....ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 마이크가 진짜 목소리 다 쳐먹네 진짜 개빡치게
=
Start to cry 😭
=
I'm crying now, sister, I miss u so muchhhh. Listening this song takes me back to the time i was school. She's my youth
=
there's so much emotion in this performance... **cries in the corner**
=
2:27 마이크 문제인듯....
=
I can only imagine how happy and proud Teddy, and the rest of 2ne1 with this Bom’s performance. Maybe they were also crying especially Dara. 😭😭😭
=
*A queen and a legend.*
=
보통 영상은 더 좋게 들으라고 소리보정해서 나오는데 보정해서 이정도면 현장에서는 더 심했겠네
=
I MISS MY QUEENS :(((((
=
I got goosebumps listening to her voice ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
That 3 spotlight in the mid break is like the 3 members of 2ne1 shining down on Bom!
=
이거 뮤비 아직도 기억나ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
one of the first kpop song that I can sing along with from beginning to end...  I used to write the lyrics in my school notebook back then
=
I miss 2ne1 😭
=
Queen Bom! 😍
=
다들 노래듣고 눈물난다고 했는데 마이크 안나오는거 알고 다들 표정 굳어짐
=
1:04 isnt that sihun from pdx 101? (kinda looks like him)
=
She stands out really! Even without moving!
=
I cry until the end... I missed thm sm
=
This is the song that introduces me into Park Bom & 2NE1
It was gayo daejun when she sang it with Taeyang
It was my first gayo after all and I cried seeing her on mainstream stage again😭😭😭
My precious campus life filled with 2nd gen kpop 
How time flies 😭😭
=
Come on mnet invite minzy cl Dara, and see what's going to happen, let's all recommend it, let's do it
=
Man I thought this was a CD recording, but then I remembered this is Park Bom & she is just that amazing. Song brings back memories
=
Hermosa ♥️
=
I. Am. Literally. Crying. This brings so many memories with the girls. Thank you for being so strong. I know it wasn’t easy at all but bitch, you’ve made it anyways!! ❤️❤️❤️ Keep it up 🌽🌽 keep smiling 🤗🤗 always be happy ❤️❤️❤️



I am so proud of you Bommie. I love you so much. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ #BlackJacksince2009 #NOLZA
=
WELCOME BACK PARK BOM !!!   ...the Blackjacks have been waiting !
=
am I the only one here who imagined that the other members of 2ne1 would show up at 3:31 ? but sadly they didn’t.
=
this hurts :(( i miss them performing together
=
이 노래 진짜 좋아했는데 ㅜㅜ❤️❤️
=
Rewatching all the performance of our Bommie. 💚😍
=
Goosebumps ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
She’s nervous but I proud of you.i don’t care about win or lose but for me u are my queendom already <3....she the one that i knew kpop (2nd generations)
=
yuna's face at 0:25 I'M SCREAMING
=
2:11 they're look familiar
=
this song brings back the old time,   *i need a tissue now*
=
Park Bom is a queen win or lose she’s always remain one
=
봄아 잠시나마 내학창시절로돌아간느낌을줘서 고마워 눈물이핑돌았어 봄아 정말로 다시 노래해주고 용기내줘서 고마워 사랑해
=
Missing 2ne1 so much at this point now love you 💖💖💖
=
O my god!!! Her vibe😲😲
She's truly a queen
=
Don't know why but I can't watch this video without crying. The feels bruh 😭💔
=
Omg bom.... ❤❤❤
=
Bom be like: So I might be a single contender here, hope you don't mind bringing some help. 🤔

*of course I'm a forever fan of 2NE1 so I need English subs tho 😭
Park Bom!!! 🔥🔥🔥
=

=
Who agree that Boom is one of a kind? 😭😭😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤
=

송출이 이상한듯...방청때 절대 이런 느낌 아니고 개대박 존나 잘했음 ㅜ
=
**cries in Korean**
=
why am crying 😭, miss you and love you so much 2ne1. Blackjack always beside you 😭
=
i wish i could see them performing again
=
OMG.. I'm crying.. Missing 2ne1 so much.. Really hope they're perform together again..
=
I can’t help think the three spotlight at 3:11 symbolizes Dara cl and minzy tho bom is there alone she’s still representing 2ne1 as a whole 😩
=
I look forward to the reunite of 2NE1, missing them so much
=
이노래는 정말 눈물나는 ㅠㅠㅠ..
=
본실력이면 더 전율 느낄수있을텐데 너무 아쉽ㅠㅠㅠ 그래도 잘부른당..
=
I really miss 2ne1... Hearing Park Bom voice, it remind me to 2ne1
=
사람들이 왜 토토가에 나왔던 가수들 보고 눈물 흘리는지 이제 알 거 같다
=
Bom I miss you and 2ne1😭 Fightinnnggggggg legend boom🔥🔥❤️
=
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I love you, Bom <3
=
Feel like crying.. really miss 2ne1.. thank for our queen for coming back to us..
=
I hope some or maybe all of the members of 2ne1 can appear with Bom on stage😭
=
와 이 노래를 다시 듣게 될거라구 생각못했는데 너무 짠하고 슬프고 고맙고 그래..
=
We love you Park Bom~♥~

=
2:35 마이크 개심각
=
i am crying!!! 😭😭😭
=
저기요...엠넷...님...다른가수분들이보셔도 마이크가 이상한걸 눈치채신것 같은데...중간에 박봄님께서도 마이크.가리키며 이상하다했는데.....좀만 더 신경써주셨으면좋았을것 같네요...
=
It's still the same as frist time I heard that.
=
omg feel like my old kpop is coming. I'm cry a lot miss u Park Bom 😭😭😭😭
=
even though she place 5th i bet everyone was just speechless in her performance..

who keeps coming back to watch this performance?
=
I just cant enjoy this or others Bom's videos because of other singers reaction in the middle of video.Its just too much, i just wanna skip video.(nothing against these singers)
=
If 2ne1 performs here on queendom, its all over for everyone.. Legends are coming back.. I can feel it!!! Mnet please make it happen. For once, make this happen please.
=
2:27 박봄언니가 신호 보냄

=
I got goosebumps!!uri Bom.. So proud 😭😭😭
=
How many Park Bom fans Here in the philippines? I start to 1 !
=
They were all reminded that they were in the presence of a real queen. I love most of the current generation group but it’s just a different vibe with the 2nd gen, they’re legendary. I’m suddenly missing 2NE1 all over again.
=
😭😭😭 I missed 2ne1
=
Her performance makes me cry. This is how professional she is even though the mic is not working properly still she sang her song..
Missing 2ne1 here 😞😞😞
=
I believe this is how they welcome you in Heaven.
=
음향 쓰레기여 음악 다루는 프로에서 뭔 엠씨용 마이크를 줬나
=
Thank you MNET for those 3 lights behind Miss Bom.
=
ㅠㅜ ㅠㅜ 너무조아
=
이 노래가 벌써 10년전 노래라니... ㅜㅜ
그때 2EN1 음악 다 듣고 좋아했는데..
=
3:57 is he is an idol?
=
I felt like there's something wrong with her mic. I noticed her tapping it. And her voice was in and out. Good thing she pulled it through. 💚
=
마이크 멀쩡했음 퀸덤 대표하는 레전드 무대였을것
=
I love you Bom❤😭
=
Park Bom is so professional, at 2:27 she states that there’s problems, but I barely noticed
=
I cried when the first "oh" came out😭😭😭😭 Legendary girl group 2NE1 and legendary main vocal Park Bom.💚 Love you forever.💚
=
SHE DESERVE SONG OF THE YEAR!!! KEEP VOTING OUR BOMMIE DEAREST BOMBSHELL AND BLACKJACK!!! MAKE OUR CANDY PROUD!!!

=
Al escuchar este tema me sentí nostalgia de por si se cayeron las lágrimas fue uno de mis temas favoritos 2ne1 las extraño mucho
=
Its like concert, the rest of the participants were mere guests
=
Park Bom just found a way to eat her digital single of 2009

=
마이크 너무 짜증나, 박봄의 묵소리 얼마나 예뻔데 ㅠㅠ

=
SHE’S A LITERAL GODDESS 🤩🤩🤩
=
I love bom ❤❤❤
=
이세상 그 어떤 누구도 부터 마이크 완전 안나왕

=
내 추억 노래 의 주인공 박봄!!
=
박봄 목소리는 진짜 대체불가다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ yg에서 이런 보컬 스타일 고집하고 선호하는거같은데 시초는 박봄이었지. 누굴 데리고 와도 이 음색은 못따라감ㅋㅋ 사람들 박봄 퇴물이라고 몰아가는거 개웃김 실제로 한번이라도 들어봤나 모르겠네 어휴
=
3:58 누군지 아시는분
=
We love u bom❤️🙂
=
첫 어어오우 하자마자 울컥하네

=
I miss you so much , This perf made me cry  so much . Thank god I got you .

=
마이크 문제 있는지 몰랐는데 댓글보고 알았다.... 너무 잘 불어서 감동하고 입틀막하면서 보고 다시 보러왔는데 이제야 알았네.... 너무 잘 불러서 전혀 몰랐다......
=
큐영 x 홀리 영상 때문에 도입부 부분만 들으면 터짐...ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=

=
히트곡은 당연 박봄이 우세지
=
Never enough to hear her voice
=
girlie is struggling to hit the noted 😭😭😂
=
She really is from another world 💕
=
2:27 솔찍히 뛰어나가서 바꿔주길 바랬음 상관없으니까
=
얼굴비치는 여자가수들이 이노래를 듣고 부르면서 자랐을 거라는 생각에 더 감동이다
=
queenbom...you'r the  best......amazing voice....
=
헐.... 마이크 문제있었어요?
박봄님이 너무 잘해서 몰랐는데....
=
진짜 박봄은 다 모르겠고 실력으로 싹 발라버린다 듣는 중에 계속 소름만 돋아
=
Even all these other girl groups get teary eyed and nostalgia how can we views not? I remember crying so hard watching the music video💕Honestly this song is so beautiful💕
=
인정하기 싫지만 저 시대 YG는 노래 하나는 진짜 잘 뽑았음 빅뱅이랑 투애니원 모두 ㅋㅋ  하루하루 거짓말 파이어 론리 등등
=
TE AMO ♥️ PARK BOM
=
2:25 마이크 톡톡 치는부분
=
진짜 이 노래만 들으면 왤케 눈물 나는지
가사랑 멜로디 다 너무 감동적 ㅠㅜㅠ
전주 흘러나올 때 진ㅉ ㅏ ㅠㅠㅔ
=
엠넷 일해라ㅡㅡ 어찌 가수한테 저런 마이크를주지..
=
IM STILL Hoping that she can bring her girls along with her.🤘🏼😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤞🏼
=
Park Bom, such a distinguished Kpop idol legend.
=
2:42 둘도 마이크 문제 있는 거 아는 것 같음 표정이
=
❤❤❤❤
=
2:28 이때 마이크 가리킨 이유가 마이크가 이상해서 그런건가?
=
벌써우리가 박봄을 보고
토토가를 보면서 추억에빠지는 아재들처럼 
추억과 향수에 빠지는 세대가 되어버렸다니 시간 참 빠르다...어릴땐 영원할줄 알았지 투애니원도 박봄도 이젠 추억이되버렸구나
=
진짜 다시보고 싶었던 무대중 하나였는데...
마이크때문에 너무 아쉽네요...
=
It makes me think of them so much
=
Beautiful!
=
*here we go again!*
=
There are a lot of China fans miss them also... 'Park bom you and 1' was on the hot search in weibo for whole day...
=
A legend indeed
=
다들 마이크 문제때메 다 얼굴 굳음....
=
I dont know why but just listening to this im crying in tears. I used to really love 2ne1 songs. And to see her singing this on the verge of crying she must be really miss being 2ne1 and singing with their fans again on stage.

2ne1 disband is a big lost in music industry. I really hope Knetz can appreciate and love park bom again.
=
2ne1 완전채로 진짜 한 번만이라도 진짜 보고싶다. 봄 언니 언니 정말로 잘 했어요 이건 저 마이크를 준 앰넷인지 암넷인지가 잘 못 된거니까 언니 아무리 밑에 순위여도 좀만 더 힘내세요 ❤️
=
All the haters will try to bring her down everytime but what they don't know is Park Bom is a powerful and strong woman with a big passion.She have fall once but she rise again with the power of her fans and her willingness to proceed what she passionate about.She always get support and love from all over the world!!! SHE IS SO LEGENDARY AND POWERFUL!!!!
=
好厲害👍
=
Legend 😎👍
=
Love bom 💛💛
=
I cried for 2 hrs rewatching this. My childhood, my goddess.
=
So, she’s once again proving that she’s in the wrong country. With that voice, she deserves to be known worldwide.
=
Why am I crying? 😢😢😢
=
이노래 진짜 좋아하는데 보면서 너무 좋았어요!!
=
i love you bom.Blackjacks will support you always..your already a Queen for us .
=
4am literally im sobbing , Park Bom own the stage again😢😭 this is not for competing but own the stage like her own concert😢😭😭👏👏👏👏 im really crting Park Bom ...happy to see you again onstage Queen👏👏👏
=
제발 엠넷아.. 마이크가 이상하다고 이 문장만 자막달아주면 안되겟니..?? 사람들이 박봄 가창 딸린다고 계속 오해하고 있잖니..ㅠㅠ 2:27분에 이상하다고 가리켯고 유튜브에 You and I 최근에 부른거 들으시면 아실텐데.. 제발.. 여러분 박봄님 가창딸린거아니고 소리가 안나와서 잇는 힘껏 부르셔서 딸린걸로 느낀겁니다ㅠㅠ 제발 모두가 알수잇게 알려주세요..ㅠ
=
OMG...i'm crying....:((((
=
No one can beat park bom, and thier group 2ne1, thier legend, 😍😍😍😍💕❣😭😭😭
=
진짜 노래 듣고 옛날 생각 많이남
너무 좋구나
추억이 새록새록하네
=
마 ㅜㅜ 이 ㅜㅜ 크 ㅜㅜ 왜 ㅜㅜ 저 ㅜㅜ 래 ㅜㅜㅜ
=
박봄 혼자서 부담스럽지 않을까 걱정했는데 이미 선곡부터 개사기 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 우리 모두 유앤아이 듣고 자랏잖아요 ㅠ
=
This made me ter me up sm
=
음색 진짜 개좋다
=
I miss you so much my bommie love from philippines☺
=
박봄이여서 저런 잣같은 마이크로도 커버 가능한건가
=
Bom never failed to slay. Even she's now a solo singer. She claims her own throne. And protects her crown in her own way.
=
와 이 무대를 다시 보다니 소름돋았다 진짜 많이 들었는데
=
Gosh it brings back a lot of memories
=
scream blackjack!!😍😍
=
큐영이 모창한 거 보고 바로 왔다...
=
I wonder if all of Big Bang members and 2ne1 watched and cried w/us 🙌🎀 Park Bom, we all love you 💋😘😘😘
=
3:29
She looks so confident
I miss it
=
I MISS U 2NE1😭😭😭
=
I just realized how much I missed 2ne1. FUUCK YOU YG
=
소름~~ 추억도 새록새록이고 녹슬지 않았어ㅠ
=
I think they opened the doors because they showed 4 columns of lights, like the number of members that were in 2NE1 and they keep them on until the end. Now she is a soloist but she always remembers her group, this presentation made me cry, I'm not blackjack but I have always loved Park Bom's voice and the love she has for all members in 2NE1 is really beautiful.
=
어쨌니 저쨌니 욕하는 사람도많고 빠는 사람도 많지만
확실한건 저큰무대에 혼자 서있어도 무대가 안비어보이는건 사실
=
폭탄 머리 긴!
너무 예쁘다!🌹💓💓
=
음색 깡패ㅜㅜ
=
I was like "Oh wow!" for the whole performance. The stage was made for Park Bom and its so mesmerizing to see such a legend sing an emotional and powerful song. Applause to everybody who made this wonderful stage for Bom. 👏👏👏👍❤
=
Her voice is so unique. We know that it’s her voice although we close our eyes. Always love and support her. Let’s make her know she is not alone.
=
진짜 너무너무 좋아하는노랜데 망할 마이크때문에 노래 계속 끊겨서 진짜 짜증난다ㅠㅠ 게다가 엠넷은 진짜 마이크 끊길때마다 화면 ㄱ계속 돌려서 박봄이 일부러 안부른것처럼 하고 하..진짜 개화난다..
=
2절? 그쯤에 마이크,,ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아예 걍 묻혀버리는데,,ㅋ
=
나 진짜 눈물 나 😭😭 2NE1은 내 마음속에서 제일 특별한 그룹이야~ “안녕이란 말은 never” 약간 맴버들한테 하는 말 같기도 하고
=
리허설때 마이크 모니터 테스트 다 할텐데 저 따구러 하나;;;
=
유앤아이 정도면 
필살기 아니냐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 개조아 ㅠ
=
Legendary
=
I need G-dragon to come and said this again " when you put park bom in a song then it became a good song" .. sadly she is bit weaker in her voice,always seem like she hardly to control her voice and  breathing.
=
마이크 제길..
=
마이크든 뭐든 ,,, 노래 너무 젛다....
=
for a second i thought 2ne1 was coming out when the doors opened i almost had  a full on heart attack
=
아깝고 아까운 2NE1. 
반드시 다시 뭉쳐서 멋진 무대 만들어주세요.
=
So. Much. Feels. :’( #parkbom #2ne1forever
=
2:28 she was tapping her mic I think somethings wrong with her mic and she was giving signal about it.
=
Ok. I'm gonna cry myself to sleep tonight
=
이 노래를 방송에서 다시 들을수있었던것 자체가 너무 감사했다,,,진짜 저 노래가 막 발매됐을 당시가 생각나서 너무 울컥하고 되게 뭉클했다,,,그때 기억이 나면서 진짜 노래가 향수를 불러일으킨다는게 뭔지 다시 한번 느꼈다

근데 마이크가 자꾸 끊겨서 박봄이 마이크 두드리는걸로 제작진한테 신호 주는거 같은데 너무 아쉽다,,,마이크가 자꾸 끊기는데 본인은 얼마나 아쉬웠을까
=
오늘도 들으러 왔다
=
퀸덤 무대 보면서 모든 무대 음향이 개별로여서 빡쳤는데 이 무대는 정말 심했다. 근데 노래를 너무 잘하셔서 금방 다시 몰입 할 수 있었음ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
다 마이크 문제있는거 눈치 챈것 같다... 그래도 봄이 언니 실력은...★
=
Gosh amazing performance
=
마이크 미쳤나...완전 들쑥날쑥..솔직히 보는 가수분들도 표정에서 살짝 알아차린 느낌이었는데 박봄이 싸인도 보내고....흐미
=
I was really trying not to cry because I'm not in the right mind to be dropping tears, but bom seriously made my eyes water. The song is so wholesome and you can't help but think about the old days and 2ne1. She did a fantastic job. I would have started to cry if I was her cause i would miss my girls. Good job Bom, we love you and always will love 2ne1 ❤❤❤ come back home 2ne1😭
=
Park bom and 2ne1 i love them all
=
마이크가 저렇게 많은데 왜하필 박봄한테 저런 그지뼉다구같은 마이크를 쥐어주냐고ㅜㅜㅠㅠ
=
Oh my God.!
=
Park Bom forever a queen❤️
#BlackJack still strong 💗
#Bomshell strong 🌸
2nd generation = gold 👑👑
=
눈물 나네요. 오랜만에 듣기도 했지만, 진짜 무대보니 눈물이 울컥!!
유앤아이 보고 한 볼걸ㅠㅠ
=
마이크 진짜 이상하네...
=
A whole vocal queen
=
ㅠㅠ 퉤니원 활동할때 쓰시던 금색인가 녹색으로 번쩍번쩍 거리던 커스텀 마이크인가 그거 어디갔나욥ㅠㅠ 마이크 상태 ㄹㅇ 에바
=
This show should be call “queenbom “ .
=
눈에서 눈물난다 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
Anyone heard the fanchant? MAYYYGOOOOOODODDDD THANK U KOREAN FANS!
=
Yeah bom go go go!!!
=
박봄 진짜 퀸이야 그냥 퀸이야 분위기로 제압해버려 미쳤어 무대에 혼자 있는데도 꽉차있는 느낌이야 그저 퀸 봄 눈물 나
=
I think bom's lymph nodes are acting up again, she's been holding her throat before she went up onstage. Some parts were sang with difficulty but the overall emotion and impact of the perfomance is good
=
너무 좋다
=
When she said the intro took her back to middle school, I felt that 😢
=
She’s already a queen period
=
오잉 마이크가 너무 안좋다고 해서 걱정했는디 걍 레전든디
=
마이크가 이상한거였구나,,박봄이 오랜만에 너래해서 힘들어한줄 알았는데ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park bom! Waeyo? 😭😭😭
=
모습은 조금 바뀌엇어도 목소리와 감정은 예전과 변함 없이 이어지고잇다
=
ฟังไม่ออกนะพูดจริง แต่ดันร้องไห้เฉยอะ 😢😢😢😢
=
Hwasa looks like she's about to cry😭 
I wonder how it feels to be in a show with your idol!! #2ne1forever ❤️
=
I came here from bom's hann performance and she did the 2ne1 hand sign now I'm crying harder watching this :(((
=
She's already a queeen
=
1:04....DiD I FwEakIn sAwbNmbOys?
=
하필 자기 노래부르는데 마이크가 ㅈㄴ짠하내 진짜 
아 빡친다
=
박봄이 아이돌계 한획을 그었던 투애니원의 메인보컬이였다. 급식들이 알턱이있나 박봄외모만 보이겠지
=
이제 꽃길만 걷자 ~~~~~봄아 ~~~~~~~~♥
=
I love you park bom ❤️
=
;_; ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Stages/production like these can only be pulled off my 2ne1.. i miss them so muccchhh!!!
=
내가 2ne1팬은 아니였지만 음향이 ㅈ쓰레기라는건 알겠다. 그리고 공감 일으키려고 가수리액션 넣는건 알겠는데 이런 무대는 좀 감상하게 리액션좀 적당히 넣는게 좋을듯
=
the other groups reaction really are the worry for Bom because Bom feels like she cried because of the missing tone and lyrics (I thinks so) But I clearly know that Bom really miss 2ne1
=
진짜 마이크 ...레전드 무대를 망쳐놨어 사전에 테스트도 안하고 준거냐..
=
Her legs oml
=
박봄 맥일라고ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 2NE1도 되게 고생 많이 했고 열심히 할려고 해도 잘 못뜬 그룹이라 동시대 그룹 중에 실력 있다고 생각하는 몇 안되는 그룹 중 하난데 지금 저딴 식으로 대우하네
=
Park bom’s “oooohhhh” woke the sleeping heart of blackjacks all over the world.. it even woke the blackjack with in these girls...

Edit: i created a video for the blackjacks called “awakening of the blackjacks” because of this hahaha
=
이 순간이 이렇게까지 감동적인건가...? (정말 단순 궁금)
=
m넷 마이크 정상인고 갖다줘라
=
와 진짜 마이크 나였어도 진짜 개빡칠듯 뭔 마이크상태가 저래 ;;
=
I want to see 2ne1 again😢
=
I don’t understand a single word but this performance make me so emotional
=
Why im crying :< because of 2ne1 i became a kpop fan for 10yrs now :< Boooommiieeee 💖💖
=
there are some pdx contestants in the audience omg-
=
투애니원 너무 그립다 박봄 진짜 많이 힘들었다고 인터뷰 본 것같은데 다시 좋은 노래 내주고 듣게 되서 너무 좋고 고맙다 나중에 할머니되든 상관없으니까 투애니원 다시 뭉쳤으면 좋겠고 앞날에  정말 봄만 오기를 바란다
=
마이크 영비가 쓰던 거 줬냐
=
was it just me or could other people kinda hear her trying not to cry during it?
=
마이크 문제였구나.
난 뭐지?했네.
=
와 이 노래가 나왔을때 나 초등학생이었어... 그때나 지금이나 노래 좋다
=
She's a LEGEND of KPOP, point blank period
=
I miss 2ne1 😢
=
when they disbanded i was so devastated thinking i wont have the chance to see her sing again. and now we're here. i am just so proud of you Bom!😭♠️
=
Wooow  love it ♥️
=
<3 <3 <3 <3
=
She's absolute man
=
2ne1💞
=
Me encantó! 👍☺️
=
박봄 곡중에서 최고로 좋아했던 곡.....2ne1 보고싶습니다....
=
3:58 😍😍😍
=
목소리 진짜 답답하다... 노래는 개좋은데 
꽉막힌느낌;
=
Damn, Park Bom is so untouchable, I mean... she sings like she is breathing. I'm so proud of her in so many levels.
=
박봄 치면 you and i 지금부르는거랑 you and i 2ne1 시절에 부른거랑 나란히 있는데 뭔가 눈물난다
=
마이크.. 왜 저딴걸 가져다줬어....아.. 혼자 서있는데
노래라도 마음껏 하게 해줘야지..
=
암넷진짜 다 터트린다 ... 마이크 뭐냐고 미쳤나 진짜
=
분명 요즘 박봄을 보면 바뀐 외모? 때문에 2NE1을 너무 좋아했던 팬으로서 마음이 아프다가도 돌아온 박봄 노래를 들으면 힘내서 돌아와줘서 너무 고맙다 싶은 생각밖에 안드네요.
=
뭐야 ㅠㅠ 마이크 너무 구려 ㅠㅠ 계속 지직소리 들리고 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ봄언니 신경 더 써줘요 슈슨데 ㅠㅠ
=
3:57 ??
=
퀸덤 언젠가는 2ne1 다 한번 나와주면 좋겟다ㅜㅠ
=
박봄 폐활량은 진짜... 저 노래 숨이 얼마나 차는데..
숨을 귀로 쉬시나..
=
들을 때마다 마이크 상태가 너무 아쉽다. 이거 뭐 노래를 들어 줄 수가 없는 수준 ㅠ 1라운드는 음원으로 안 나와서 천만다행임 ㅋ
=
Am I the only blackjack here who cries watching this??. 
 
*cries han river*  😭 #2NE1 #blackjack #BOM
=
가암히 박봄님한테 어디 코노에서 주숴온 마이크를 쓰누
=
Oh i realllllyyyy loves her voice😇😇 like a angel💓💓💓💓
=
저개같은 마이크로 저정도 퀄리티를 만들다니 존나대단함
=
박봄씨두 개인 마이크 들고다니세요 좋은거루다가 ㅎㅎ 이런일 생기지 않게
=
박봄이야 말로 진짜 혼자서 무대를 장악하는 것이 이거야 말로  진짜 정말 무대의 퀸이지
=
We love you Park Bom, we are all here to support, whatever it takes. We are all proud of you, 😍😍🤗 i miss u all "2ne1"
=
Come here to (G)idle cover
=
아니 박봄이 여기서 비빌 짬밥이냐
=
박봄❤️
=
No one can ever copy park bom's voice. She has a very unique voice and i love it!
=
I always have to cry when i hear boms voice - especially when it has this sad color to it
=
If she do the same like a "You and I (Live 8.11.2009)" mybe she can be top 3..coz when she dance so cute..like's other group..
=
2ne1 comeback pleaseeeee😭😭😭
=
엠넷 제발 마이크 관리 좀 똑바로 해줘요 이게 뭐야 ㅜㅠ
=
Question: " your thought about joining queendom as a group?"

Park Bom: i respected that. But i as good as the whole group performing 😎


*MY QUEENBOM* 😭💜
=
:((((((((((((( my queens, reunite pls pls pls
=
Keep streaming
=
Goosebumpppppps!!!!!! Oh Bom!
=
❤️
=
여기나오는 걸그룹들이 아마 이노래를 들으며 가수의 꿈을 키우고 연습생 생활을 견뎠겠지.. 진짜 소름돋는다.... 박봄이 투에니원 빈자리를 느낄만하다..😭
=
보미 언니의 도전 넘응원 ㅠ
=
마이크 상태 왜저래....
=
다시봐도 마이크가 너무 아까워요 연결문제가 ㅠ
=
Love​ you​ 💕
Park​ Bom​🌹
=
The only 2nd generation artist to be represented there. To be able to perform again (alone without her group anymore) after so many years of unnecessary hate by haters, Park Bom deserves everything!! Always stand by Park Bom!! #RealBlackjack
=
존경하는 내 모델
=
I FELT SO DAMN TORTURED! MY HEART IS FALLING APART! BOMMIE I LOVE YOU!!!! GEEZ I'M BALLING MY EYES OUT HERE 😭😭
=
I hope she could got a chance to sing "We Belong Together" and  "Forever with you" with GD and TOP. plus I want to hear her rap again .. Oh my!
=
GO BOM ! ❤❤❤
#2NE1
=
박봄은 ㅈㄴ 열심히 하는데 마이크가 문제인듯 물론 박봄한테도 문제가 있을수 있지만 90% 가 마이크 문제라고 불수있다
=
2ne1 comeback
=
하 그립다ㅠ
=
초라한 나지만 오늘 그댈 위해 이 노래를 불러요 하는데 뭔가 울컥했더 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
눈물난당 ㅠㅠ
=
컨디션 난조&긴장감 때문에 떠는 것도 있지만 라이브가 살짝 불안정해 보이는건 마이크 문제가 80%예요 최근 팬미팅에서 불러준 유앤아이 영상보면 오히려 실력이 늘면 늘었음.. 무반주로 돈크라이 부른 영상만 봐도 알 수 있어요 엠넷 진짜 박봄으로 어그로 끌거 다 끌고 화제성 모았으면 똑바로 해라
=
I miss 2ne1 so much
=
아니 박봄 완벽한 보컬 듣고 싶었는데 마이크 도랏냐고....
=
너무 아쉬운 인재다..
=
2:20 2:34 2:40 3:57 마이크 문제있는데 가수들이나 팬들로 카메라 돌려버리네..
차라리 암전되었을때 바꿔주지.. 2:27에서 문제있다고 손으로 표시하는구만... 이러니 논란되지;;
=
박봄도긴장한듯ㅜㅜ떨린다 원래더잘하는데
=
뒤에 합창단때문에 혼선왔나부네....
=
mic problem when u see bom tap the mic
=
눈물 저만 흘렸나요??
=
Bom try her best!!!
=
그녀는 2en1이였다. 말이 필요한가.
모두가 소름돋는 추억의 한 조각이다. 박봄도 이노래도 진짜 소름돋는다.
=
마이크 누가 가져다 준거야? 코노마이크
=
아무리 안 좋아도 음이 저렇게는 안됌. 100퍼 마이크 문제
=
마이크 왜 저래 !!!!
=
Keep on shining again PARK BOM!!!!
=
if 2NE1 reunites on this show, they will win for sure 😭❤️
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I miss 2ne1  😭😭😭
=
ohhhhh god i cried HARDT
=
THIS PERFORMANCE REMEBBER ME OF MJ
=
마이크 문제네여 2절시작인가 뭐 어쨋든 제스쳐로 마이크 손가락으로 툭툭치는거있네
=
2:11 핑크색 머리분 백진 아니에요??
=
마이크 다이소에서 샀냐
=
마이크 간수 잘 안 하나 엠넷...
=
Why I'm cry see it...i feel i really miss you
=
What a loss of this gg gen couldn't enjoy the moment of 2NE1...
=
❤
=
박봄 마이크도 이상하고.. 살짝 숨 벅차하는것 같기도 하다..
=
💖💖💖👏
=
왠지 투애니원 다른멤버들 이거보고 울고있을듯
=
마이크 건드는거에서부터 박봄이  자꾸 마이크가 제대로 나오질 않으니까 툭툭 치는거지
마이크가 맛 간게 보이는데 못한다 그러고 그래되네 
마이크를 제대로 준 걸 줘야지 
저게 뭐하는 짓이야 진짜;;;;;
=
그냥 소리가 나오다말고 나오다말고 암전 직전엔 하이라이트인것같은데 걍 삼켜버리네
=
왜 이렇게 보는데 눈물이 나지 오랜 공백기간을 기다린 팬들에게 전하는 노래 같네
=
전주만 들어도 소름
=
Pure goosebumps factory.. I love you park bom
=
if mnet ever bring cl, minzy, dara.. im so gonna cry like there is no tommorw.. really miss them! i love u parkbom!
=
엠넷 진짜 일 안하는 걸까? 피디들아 마이크 테스트 제대로 할 수 없겠니? 오직 너의 밥그릇만 생각해야해? 그런다고 뭐가 달라지니? 이 분은 이미 퀸이고 너넨 짓밟을 수 없어 엠넷개x식들아 엠식들;;;
=
Earlier today, I was singing and humming "You and I" while driving. It's one of those smooth cruising and a lovely song in my head. Bom, you never fail me. Love you! 💚💚💚
=
첨에 박봄 숨 딸려서 그런 줄 알았는데 마이크가 왜 저래 ,,, 중간에 마이크 톡톡 치는 거 보고 진짜 탄식..
=
Love this song..
=
she’s was sooo cute at 2:25 when she points the mic to fix it.
=
중간중간 마다 가사 씹어먹는게 마이크때문이구나 숨차서 끊기는소리 나는줄 알았는데 엠넷 진짜!!
=
I AM CRYING GUYS I AM CRYING
=
처음에 전주 듣는데
정말 머라 말할수 없는 감정이 밀려온다..
=
진짜; 전주만 듣고 소름돋고 전율 흘렀다.
=
진짜 음향은 신경써주자 왜이러냐 ㅡㅡ
=
이 언니 목소리는 진짜 국보급이다
마이크 저딴걸주고 ㅡㅡ
=
Im crying okay but im happy
=
We, Blackjacks are so proud of you.😘🖤
=
Mnet always had the highest ratings with 2NE1. They better bring 2NE1 this show. She is good as solo but we need 2NE1. They didnt deserve disbanding because of rat YG.
=
Tôi nhớ các cô gái của tôi 😭 2ne1 ❤❤
=
에오~
=
Park Bom y su gran voz.
=
봄이 목소리로 라이브로 이노랠 또 들을줄 몰랐어.. 진짜 너무 고맙고 또 고맙다.. 방송 다시 나온다는거 쉬운결정 아니였을텐데 너무 고마워 봄아..
=
เสียงเพราะเหมือนเดิมเลยย 😙
=
❤️
=
봄아...얼굴이 왜 그렇게 됐니...ㅠㅠ너무 심하다..
=
I don't really know why she's in the place, gurl she's singing it lived
=
마이크 안나와서 계속 톡톡 치고있는데....
=
She showed a lot of vulnerability.
=
박봄 좋아
=
cant 2ne1 reform back under P Nation? please!!!!!!!!!!!
=
I'm so glad Park Bom went on this show. Shes too talented and I'm glad she got to showcase her talents here even if she didnt win. Shes amazing and I hope the best for her!! Seeing her in this performance honestly made me cry. This song is one of my favourite song and I'm so happy she got to perform it again!
=
박봄 다른건 다 몰라도 노래실력은 깔게못됨
=
아뭐야 마이크 고장난줄 모르고 감정 북받쳐서 울음 터질려는건줄 알았네 괜히 짯네 ㅅㅂ
=
I wanna cry🤐😩😩
Please 2NE1😭
=
Kalo park boom nyanyi tuh slalu aku tuh merinding
=
YG WAS SO DUMB FOR WASTING HER talent WHEN SHES THIS AMAZING
=
마이크 안좋음에도 불구하고 음색이랑 노래랑 너무 좋다 진짜
=
저때는 그냥 아이돌에서 가창력이 탈아이돌 평가 받고 아티스트로 평가 받았을때였지
=
I haven't heard this song for a loooooong time. I miss you Bom! 💕
=
왜왜왜~!! 박봄이 꼴지냐?? 마마무 보다 잘했다~!!
=
2:26 she is sending signal "mic has a problem"....
=
마이크에 확실히 문제가 있었네요. 리허설때 수정을 못한걸 보면 엠넷이 음향쪽에 별다른 조치를 취해주지 않은건 두고두고 까임권 얻은 일일듯..
=
I think the reason she sounded choppy towards the middle to end was because of the mic. At 2:23 you see her tap the microphone as if she hears herself weird in her earpiece
=
마이크 문제로 라이브 인증했네
=
나도 2년제 군대에서 들었음 시박
=
Queen of vocals!!
=
She is so Wonderful!!
=
Try not to cry challenge miserably FAILED! 💔😭😭
=
옛날에 올림픽공원에서 2NE1 공연할 때 보러갈걸... 컴백해주시면 안 될까요.
(KT에 있는 투애니원 소장용 공연 재감상하며ㅠㅠ)
=
I feel like its little bit unfair competing against new gen group with active fan based. Most of the old kpop fan are not active to industry anymore because of major changes.
=
실력 어디 않가네!!!
저 무대 장악력!!!멋지다!!!
=
M.net뭐임?
실망임
나이 많은 사람으로 
무대에 마이크가 저 상태임
80년대도 아니고 참
=
세상.. 존버하길 잘했다 박봄 유앤아이를 다시 무대에서 보다니
=
박봄이 라이브 잘 못한다는 사람들아,,, 1:24 여기를 봐 암만들어도 마이크 문제잖아,,;;;; 다른부분도 그런데 박봄이 라이브 너무 잘해서 그나마 너희가 라이브를 못하는거라 느끼는거라고
=
We Park Bom’s international fans appreciate the English sub so much!!! Thank you 🙏🏻 🙏🏻🙏🏻
=
💕💕💕💕
=
박봄 실력의 문제가 아니라 프로그램 포맷에 안맞는 출연자인데 출연시킨 엠넷이 잘못함. 나이도 많고 솔로인 박봄이 아무리 노래를 미친듯이 해봤자 1위하기는 힘든 시스템이다. 시즌2 혹시할거면 솔로는 따로빼라.
=
Park Bom eonni ❤❤❤😚👌
=
Is this Park Bom solo tour?  

Cause it is
=
저노래 나왔을때가 10대의 끝자락이었는데 지금 20대의 끝을향해 가고 있네
=
I dont understand whybthis came to be the fifth place. I watched all the performances but this does not deserve the 5th spot. SHE IS A LEGEND  and honestly she should not be joing Queendom, she should be judging. GO BOM WE LOVE YOU ❤
=
2:27
=
투에니원 노래 좋은 줄 처음알았어 애기 때는  왜 몰랐지?
=
FEELS
=
마이크가 숟가락몽뎅이 보다 못하네요
오히려 망치고있는 마이크네요ㅡㅡ
=
아오 티비로 들어도 마이크 이상하다;;
=
0:27
=
Waaahhh!!! 4M views yey!!, congrats unni 😍😘😁🎉🎊 
#Goosebumps
=
엠넷  장난허냐 마이크!!!!!!
=
이거 마이크 문제네 봄이가 2-26초쯤에 마이크 두드리면서 암시주네 ㅜㅜ 엠넷 뭐하냐? 이 명곡을 이케 망치너ㅜㅜ아 짱나
=
찡하고.. 눈물이난다
=
2분25초 마이크에 이상있다고 신호보내는듯
=
💕💕💕
=
왜 눈물날거같냐 전주만 들었는데 눈물남
=
Its only 1 member and im crying already what more if its 4 of them.. I miss 2ne1.. No matter what 2ne1 remains superior!! Fighting Bom!!
=
She sounds like she wants to cry. I really miss 2ne1
=
마이크 안 좋은거 줘서 괜히 논란 만들어서 어그로 끄는것 보다 좋은 마이크 줘서 원래 박봄언니 그 실력 그대로 보여주는게 시청률도 잘 나오고 좋을거 같은데 가수한테도 관객한테도 너무 안 좋은거 아니야 ? 제발 좀
=
I came back here every day especially today after Bom&Jjung's performance. Bom is really an amazing singer. I hope that even after she cried people will finally vote her. She deserves more than those 5th places she has been getting.
=
Am crying😔😔😭😭 don't stop meee😭😭
=
목소리가 진짜 특이하다 ㄷㄷ 눈 감고 들어도 이건 박봄이네👍👍👍
=
개 빡치네 일 안해 엠넷???  마이크 왜 저러냐고ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom with her unique voice..
I cry listening to this again. 😭😭😭
I miss her..I miss 2ne1 😭😭😭
=
어웅 소름끼쳥
=
Y seguimos reproduciendo 🎧✨✨✨✨❤️
=
호흡이 딸린다 어쩐다 하는데 귀가있으면 들어봐라 부르는중에 끊기는데 저건 마이크문제지
=
마이크가 소리를 울려주진 못할망정 먹는데도 노래 엄청 잘부르신다... 목소리도 되게 매력적이시궁
=
🥺🥺🥺
=
This legend doesn't deserve this type of treatment. Kpop you are dead for me.
=
😭😭
=
음향처리 박봄만 왜 이렇게 안좋아..? 중간중간에 왜 눌린것같지
=
♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
Amazing!!!😻😻👏👏👏👏
=
마이크 개빡치네
=
2:26
=
I'm a sone, and seeing park bom on this stage remind me of the day where 2nd generation standing onstage together 😢 we got ur back parkbom and blackjack
=
Duh kan jd kangen cl... Kpn cl muncul lagi di tv 😭😭😭
=
역시 프로는 장비가 쓰레기여도 거끈하다
=
do not cry we all still loyal bom and will always support you minzy dara and cl i love 2ne1
=
4.1m now!!
=
노래해줘서 고맙고 유앤아이 불러줘서 고맙다. 음향이 박봄을 못담아서 너무 아쉽다 다음엔 음향 신경좀 써줬으면ㅠㅠㅠ암튼 박봄은 신기하다 목소리 하나만으로 잊고있던 내 추억을 떠올리게 해주네. 멋있는 가수다.
=
뭔가 소리가 작아졌다 커졌다... 마이크 문제있는 거였냐고
=
Omg!
=
I'm crying
=
I feel like crying
=
Please MNET give her a microphone that won't affect/disturb her singing or just let her use her 2NE1 mic 😭
=
I'm crying Bom Eonnie🖤🖤🖤

I really don't want to watch Queendom but here i am.... 
BECAUSE I KNOW IT BRING ME BACK TO MEMORY LANE.. THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ERA OF KPOP GENERATIONS..
=
내가 다 속상하다
=
아니 시작전에 마이크 상태 체크 안해? 경연인데? 진짜 다시보기 보다가 너무 화나서 유투브 틀었다;
=
내 귀로는 문구점에서 1000원짜리 노랑색 마이크사서 검은색 색종이로 마이크 감고 진짜 마이크처럼 만들어놓은것 같은데 나만 그래???
=
Am I the only who's crying from the start till the end, I MISS 2NE1 SO MUCH 😭😭
=
박ᆢ박봄ᆢ
=
I think she said that she will invite the other members of 2ne1 in queendom ..  can't wait 😍
=
무대혼자있는게 왤캐슬프지
=
If you cant marry the kpop idol then just marry theyre fanboy/fangirls(andaming pogi my ghad nakita ko )
=
Forever be our queen!! Blackjack!
=
마이크 실화냐 음향 체크 똑바로 안하네 ㅡㅡ
=
Why is Bom even here? She's bigger than all this! Wow she's so humble and professional ❤️ Bom's  vocal is incomparable. No matter what she already won. 😊
=
저기 나온 후배들은 박봄 자체를 경쟁이 아니라 뭘해도 멋있는 선배일 뿐 일듯 진짜
=
엠넷은.. 제대로 할 줄 아는 게 하나도 없네? 아 하나 있네 악편으로 화제성 만들기 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
I hope in her next performance here, she will be with any 2en1 members
=
봄이 너무 힘들이지 말고 무대에서 아쉬움 다 채우고 조금 편안해지면 대학교수하자 자격 충분히 있잖아..
=
i love you bom💗💗💗
=
:'3 :'3 :'3 :'3

마이크문제를 무시해도 보컬이 너무 좋네요. 
여러 아이돌그룹 속에서 홀로 솔로인모습이 너무 외로워보여요. 
2NE1멤버들이 보고싶을거 같아요.
=
THE LAST HIGH NOTE OMG SO POWERFULL
=
Forever Blackjack No matter what happens
=
QUEEN SLAY
=
She is the Queen👸
=
마이크 고장나서 강제 라이브 인증됨 엠넷놈들아 일 똑바로 해라
=
I'm not crying you are? 😢
=
Wow. So many comments in hangeul
=
박봄은 역시 박봄이다 !
=
LOVE YOU PARK BOM MISS YOU 2NE1
=
얼굴에 무슨일이 일어난거여
=
I started crying
=
Her never forget 2ne1 n backjack never forget u too
=
聽到好想哭，是朴春啊啊啊啊啊啊
=
진짜 박봄 you and i .. 노래도 좋지만 박봄이 불러서 명곡 된거 아니냐.. 크 ㅠ 갓봄 진짜 좋은노래 많이 내주세요 목소리 대체불가임..
=
진짜로 박봄은 박봄이다
투애니원 생각나네
=
아니 솔라 얼굴 봤을때랑 관객샷이랑 노래가 안나오는데...박봄 팬으로써 너무한다..
=
봄아 화이팅해라 항상  응원한다 ~
=
I remember this song and still have the cd😂
=
this is now park bom's most viewed live solo stage. congrats queen!
=
박봄 퐈이팅 투애니원 그시절 참 좋앗엇는데
=
와 저 마이크로 성량이 느껴짐
=
♥️
=
마이크 누가 갔다줌;;;;
=
Remember guys that 2NE1 had a surprise comeback on MAMA 2015 so maybe... They can come back again thru this show *crossed fingers*
=
I am getting goosebumps continuously o my my...
=
Bommie de mi vida, Bommie de mi alma.
=
2:27
=
어쩐지 듣눈데 ㅈㄴ 답답하드라... 소리가 자꾸 먹어들어가는데,,, 경연에서 마이크가 이상하면....ㅋㅋㅋ......
=
Miss a's former member jia reposted this perfomance on weibo and commented shooked also said when the chorus appear and her high note i became so emotional
=
박봄 머리 귀 뒤로 빗어서 정리해주고 싶다
=
왜 눈물나냐...이 노래 나왔던 그 때로 돌아가고싶다...
=
귀걸이에 머리카락..ㅋ
=
im cryingg...
=
마이크가 별로 안좋은거 같은데 
계속 끊기네
=
아니 엠넷 일 안함??? 박봄이 마이크 문제잇다고 사인도 줬는데 뒤늦게라도 좀 바꾸지ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 뭔 마이크가 소릴 먹어 ....너무 아쉽다
=
암넷;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 나였으면 진짜 개빡쳤다 열심히 준비했을텓데ㅠㅠ 마이크 진짜 미쳤냐
=
진짜 투에니원 맞나? 아무튼 나 왜 탈퇴 했는지도 모르지만 내가 06년생임에도 불구하고 너무 슬프다.. 명곡도 많이 만들고 좋았는데
=
박봄실력에 5위면 얼마나 더 잘 불러야함?
=
나만 눈물날꺼 같은게 아니였구나,
무슨 이유에서인지는 모르겠지만
박봄에 노래를 들으면 아련하고 뭉클한 기분이 든다.
그때로 다시 돌아가는 기분 ...
=
준비 많이한것 같은데 엠넷 마이크하나도 똑바로 준비못하냐 소리 끊겨서 걍 라이브로 멱살잡고 끌고갔구만 담당 누군지 정말...ㅉ
=
아니 딱봐도 마이크에 문제가 있는듯한데 엠넷 슈바롬들은 그냥졸라 무시하네 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Much loved ♥️
=
ฟังเพลงนี้รู้สึกเลือด BlackJack พลุ่งพล่าน  คิดถึง2Ne1
=
마이크 문제 or 실력 문제 란 얘기 있어서 박봄 바로 유튜브에 검색해 보니 가장 최근 3주전(해당영상 1주전) xx대학교 축제에서 You nad I 라이브 버전 올라온 영상 있는데 실력은 어디 안간게 팩트
=
아니 마이크 실화야...? 박봄님 노래할때 마이크 계속 저런거 쓰나요 혹시?? 보고싶은데 암넷 때문에 못보겠음
=
Rose sing you and i good
Park bom sing you and i good 
Tho yg fam🥰 the uniqe fam
=
Come back to listen again and again
=
마이크 왜저래
=
She is one of the icon of kpop and i love her so much since 2ne1 ❤️
=
어렸을때 서울가는데 차에서 이노래 나와서 무슨 노래인지 궁금했는데 지듬 들으니 좀 슬프네
=
Anybody know what the name of program this?..
=
I am not crying, it's joon cutting onions
=
We can do it lets go for 5M views!!!
=
i salute bommie's bravery even if C.L, minzy, dara isn't with her to perform.. that performance might be so very emotional for her but she still managed to pull it off..
=
2:27 여기에서 원래 저런 안무인가요...? 아님 마이크 이상하다고 사인주는건가요...??
=
Love Forever 2NE1  
💗BOM
=
노래 경연 프로그램이고 전설들이 나오는데 암넷 개들아 마이크를 무슨 다방레지가 쓰던걸 가져왔냐 종나 소리 개쳐먹네 500원짜리마이큰가 병시나
=
아름다운!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
I cried so hard while I was watching. Let’s go Bommie, we’re still here supporting our queen! 
Blackjacks its about time to vote for her. Show them how strong we are!
=
대단하다 사람들 반응봐 이미 다들 빠져서 추억에 젖어있어
=
Please 2ne1 come and perform on this show please.
=
난 남자여서 잘 모르겠는데...눈화장이 진하다...
=
I miss 2ne1 a lot😭😭😭😭
=
음향 문제 있는 거 같은데.. 하 방청 가서 실제로 듣고 싶다ㅠㅠㅠ 봄언니가 대놓고 문제 있다고 마이크 툭툭 쳐주는데 그냥
=
ชั้นชอบนางอ่ะสู้ๆๆ
=
lmfaoooo
=
Her vocals😭 I love you so much my queeen!!
=
Everyone who watch this performance will get goosebumps and even you watch the perfomance many times it still give you a goosebumps.
=
I don’t know why this song is really touching my Heart.
=
You and I is a really hard song to sing, hell even to lip syncing to it, but Bommie got soo much better after her great comeback❤️
=
Kangen 2ne1 😢
=
근데 박봄 성형한 거? 인파선염 때문인가 너무 부었는데? 실력은 여전하네 마이크 문제 심한 듯
=
i know theres still a lot of fans of 2ne1 BEACUSE THEY ARE LEGENDARY GIRL GROUP!
=
박봄이 좀 숨차보이긴하지만 마이크가 막 끊기긴하네 그래서인지 아쉽다 무대 집중이 안돼...
=
why is the mic faulty T_T
=
She gave the sign to fix her mic, but yeah..
=
I dunno, why i wanna cry
=
EEEEEOOOUUUH
=
마이크 왜 저럼;;; 누가보면 노래 못 부르는 줄 알겠네
=
마이크 도랐나
=
암넷 마이크 좀 좀 ㄱㅅ들아
=
Wow.. She's a truly Queen
=
U&I 💚💚💚
=
Seeing this makes me want to see 2NE1 comeback right now 😭 I wish I can see their comeback as a new fan 😭😭😭😭
=
마이크 존나 배고프나보네 소리 존나 먹네
=
👏👏👏😍😍😍
=
이 노래는 왜 전주만 들어도 울컥하는지.  그 시절의 내가 생각나서 일까??
=
박봄 실력자입니다
이번 무대 눈물나네요
이전에 어려운 일들 많이 겪었지만 힘을 내서 그 아름다운 목소리 계속 들려주세요 듣고싶어요
=
I wish you will be famous again in my country Malaysia like u used to be 😭😭 im here after all the 5 painful years , come to Malaysia again Bommie😭 any Malaysian Blackjack here?
=
so long to see her
=
Admit it , all of us miss our TRUE QUEENS, 2NE1 😞
=
WHO ELSE IS UGLY CRYING?!??? 🥺🥺🥺🥺
=
2분26초에 마이크 확인해달라고 신호보내는거같은데 좀 쓰바고쳐주지
=
It’s time for our blackjacks to come out of our graves
=
Love you Bom 💓💓💓
=
믿기 어렵겠지만 저기 나온 아이돌들 전부 미성년자였을때 나온 노래입니다
=
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
초등학생으로 돌아간기분
=
마이크 상태가 이런데도 박봄이니까 이정도 무대 가능하지
=
박봄 얼굴진짜,,,너무 아깝다
=
마이크신호이상에 대해 이제는 많이들 아는 분위기네요 ;;; TV나간 바로 그날부터 마이크 이상에 대해 글 쓰고 다닐 때 생각하면 -_- ;;; 힘들었는데
=
🥺😢😭
=
자라헤오
=
음향팀 뭐야 ,, ㅡㅡ 봄언니가 마이크 툭툭치는거 마이크 안좋다는 신호같은데
=
마이크 왜저럼? 아진심 엠넷 너무했다
=
Love u Park boom wish 2ne1 will back again one day
=
노래듣다가 호흡길게가질부분에서 끊어버리길래 그동안 쉬면서 호흡딸리나 햇더만.. 마이크문제라니...!!ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 노래방에서 친구들하고 저노래부르던 추억돋아서 너무좋앗는데..
=
마이크가 이상하다는건 나도 느껴진다;; 소리가 먹히는 느낌이 드는데 그걸 제작진 측에서 그걸 못 느꼈을까?
=
Watching this made me remember of how a blackjack i was (and i am), teary eyes and goosebumps
=
I was crying while typing this and listening to BOM. I MISS 2NE1.
=
my favorite song!
=
울겠다
=
She is a true supertalented artist/performer
=
When I watch Queendom, I wish I see 2NE1 only one. That's a dream.
=
Damn I couldn't control my tears. I was riding a bus and watched this. 😭

This brings back all the memories. From the live performances, concerts, 2NE1 TV, and to all the times they've been together. I can't help but cry.

You did so well uri Bom. I love you since 2009. ♥️
=
She's everyone's Sunbae after all. 💕
=
im about to cry Y^Y
=
I am so proud of my baby BOM 😭😭💗

=

=

=
Blackjacks!!!! Is this a dream?😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
박봄 화이팅!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I'm crying 😢
=
Im not her fan but this 😍
=
Felt so sorry for her 😔 this was my most favourite song.
=
Goosebumps is real!!!
=
1:04 깅시훈  ProduceX101?
=
i’m gonna cry
=
It's just so good .. no matter what you say or how much you judge,  she is talented and have a voice that was made in heaven.
=
NEED 2NE1 REUNION ASAP!!!!!! IT DOESNT MATTER IF FEATURING ONLY WITH CL/MINZY/DARA!!!!!!!!!! BUT FULL MEMBER MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
I'm so happy that Park Bom's getting all the encouragement. She deserves to be well known. She deserves to be back on stage. And she deserves all the love. Fighting!💖
=
imagine, Park Bom is in MAMA 2019 line up and this song was her performing (also spring). thats gonna be lit man!
=
oww i know you
=
after I've watched it ..I imagined what if it was the  2ne1 ..  i miss them so much 😭😭😭😭😭
=
2ne1그립다
=
#respect
=
저상태로 저걸 저캐불렀어? 미친..
=
Omfg, I remember belting this song out in my room when I was 11 years old, I’m 20 now, time really flies
=
화면만 보면 불후의명곡에 패티김 선생님 쳐다보듯이 보네 ㅋㅋ 저기 아이돌들 다 박봄무대보면서 컸을텐데 경쟁이라니 ㄷㄷ
=
Bommie has one of the most unique voices in all of Kpop. I'm so glad she's finally back.
=
It's just me or Park Bom look kinda tearing up a bit during the performance? It make me want to cry.....
=
I hope she knows how special she is and how much love THE WORLD has for her I swear it's still 2012 she looks amazingly beautiful and as happy as she is on stage how much happier are we as her fans to hear her voice again !!!!! 2ne1 forever in our hearts and minds
=
이런 프로 딱히 안좋아하는데 박봄 노래 듣고싶어서 봤는데 박봄만 혼자있어서 그런지 위축되어보여서 마음 아팠음 근데 이 무대 보니까 예전 2ne1 생각나면서 눈물 날 뻔
=
omg never thought i would see this song's live again after all this year and here i am, crying fr
=
솔직히 박봄이랑 씨엘 같이나와야되는데;
=
마이크가 소리 다먹고 출력 늦게되는데 너무하네 코노가서 저런마이크걸리면 개짜증나는데 박봄 좋아하진 않지만 무대 레전드는 ㅇㅈ 볼때마다 아련..
=
I think Mnet should apologize to Bom and the Mnet audience for the microphone signal disturbances (blurring and cutting). Also, they should officially describe about this event. I found out at least 10 times of significant errors. I guess that Bom herself must have felt a lot more. Just imagine how it bothered her. Bom did tap-tap the microphone and took a rest for a phrase without singing (I think it was a signal for mic error, mic change, or music stop). It seemed that Mnet decided to proceed the music without any changes. Mnet is really thinking that they would cover their critical mistake without any apology or official announcement? In Korea, many people are shooting criticism about Bom's poor vocal cause they did not catch mic error and they just think that the poor sound was  Bom's fault (shortness of breath and being easily out of tune). How pity.
=
개빡쳐 고장난 마이크로 저정도 뽑아낸거면 제대로 된 마이크로는 훨씬 퀄리티 있는 무대 나왔을텐데 개엠넷놈들이 귀환을 이렇게 망쳐버림
=
😍😍😍😍😍
=
😭😭😭😭
=
존나눈물날것같아
=
Road to 2 Million! We can do it Blackjacks and Bomshells! ♣️♠️♥️♦️
=
2ne1 comeback stage please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
Love u forever love 2ne1
=
마이크좀 내가이래서 방송으로 안봐ㅠ 부모님앞에서 욕할까바
=
그대를 부분에서 마이크때문에 그 끊겼다 고음부분에 마이크 맛가서 중간에 작아지다가 커지는거보니 박봄언니문제가 아니라 마ㅋ이크가좃갓은거내
=
park bom cannot be compared to other groups. she's way up high. the girls looked up to her. She's park bom of 2NE1
=
😭😭😭😭😭
=
wah kacau gua merinding
=
Competition should be fair
=
why can’t we just go back in time when we had 2ne1 missA fx girls generation girls day secret 4minute AoA 💔💔🤭🤭
=
2ne1 and SNSD including Jessica need to do the last performance as a gift for the fans who support them throughout the years.  I think the fans deserve it.
=
iloveyou bom
=
3.57 I LOVE
=
หน้าน่ากลัวมาก
=
마이크 새걸로 갖다드려라 방송국놈들아
=
1등할거 같다 연슨생들은 이노래 뽑을수 밖에 없음 자신들의 인생에 영향을 준 곡인데 2000점 독식이라  이거 받으면 무조건 1위다
=
Why the heck can’t mnet provide a working mic!? Goodness sake... so glad park Bom is an absolute vocal queen! Eff the cruddy mic!
=
I miss 2ne1 😢😢😢
=
넌 나의 봄
=
im not crying, you are.
=
oh my queen.... watching u stand alone make me hurt. really miss 2ne1. real queen of kpop
=
사람들 말대로 박봄실력에 까이는게 말이되냐고 ; 살다살다 정말
=
😭😭😭😭😭
=
마이크 왜 저럼 심지어 중간에 마이크 톡톡 쳐서 문제있다고 하시는것 같은데...하여간 암넷놈들 제대로 하는게ㅜ없어;;
=
why does she sound like she struggling to hit the notes
=
... ? 마이크 상태 안좋은것 같은데 .. ? ㅜ 엄청나게 ... 그래두 박봄님 노래너무 감동적이고 좋았는데 .. 그래도 한분이서 하시는데 마이크까지 저러면 너무 힘드셨을것 같은데 ,,😨 숨도차시고 .. 그래도 너무 잘하셨어요 .. !!😭❤
=
마이크 먹통같은 걸 갖다줫네
=
Great as always, but I think imthat it would've bdsn better if the mic was not messed up 😑

Anyway, Damn feels! So much goosebumps 😍
=
My Queen
=
그냥 암넷이 박봄 실력논란 일으킬려고 일부러그런거라는 생각밖에 안남;;
=
박봄 실력이나 그런것보다 그냥 저노래들으면 저때의 저 노래 듣던때가 생각나서 뭔가 슬픔
=
I miss 2ne1......
=
2NE1 forever
=
굿
=
암넷 아직도 저러네
=
YG 일만 안터졌어도 박봄은 저기 나올 짬이 아니지.
나머지 애들이 어떻게 비벼.
=
계속 뒤에 손 넣어서 조절하는거같은데  마이크수레기...
=
머가 우리봄누나 힘들게부른데 마이크이상한거 대기실가수들다알고 보는사람도 다아는데 퀸덤마이크제발 똑바로해주세요 그래도 실력은 갑 일부러더높게하셔서 잘들리게열심히함
=
도저히 안되겠으면 불꺼졌을때 합창단 마이크랑 바꾸든가 스태프가 눈치있게 좀 튀어나와서 바꿔주지 저게뭐야 박봄만 실력으로 까이고 미쳤냐 엠넷 똑바로일안하시네
=
이걸 노래라 부르나?   
?
=
I cried so hard omg I love you bom 😭💖
=
Im crying
=
Imagine ? One of park bom performances they are complete 2ne1 who will perform in that stage .. kyahh .. can't wait hehez .. ( The mystery secret of park bom is to perform along with other members of 2ne1 in that stage ) that's her key .. Legendary performance 😍 😍😍
=
😭😭😭😭
=
약쟁이좋아하는거봐 사람들 하..
=
마이크 왜 저래 신경쓰다보니 목소리가 버겁게 들리고 고음이 끊기게들려서 삑사리난거 같이들리고 그리고 더더군다나 혼자부르는데 숨쉬는 구간만들어서 앞부분은 AR넣지...가사 첫부분 안들어가거나 뒷부분 끝까지 못부르시고ㅠㅠㅠ그래도 저에겐 위너이자 넘버1입니다 응원합니다
=
Hồi bé nghe bài này dù không hiểu gì vẫn thấy hay vc😍
=
i am literally crying rn !(((( and this is like my 917392728938th time watching this
=
노래끝나고 마이크 내릴때도 겁나 지지직 거리는구만 무슨 실력이 딸린데 ㅠㅠ
일부러 끊어가며 부르기도 힘들겠구만 ㅡㅡ
=
I think Bom is trying hard not to cry ! ... 
we love you,Bomie
=
2NE1 노래는 현재에 계속 들어도 질리지도 않고 그냥 무대 서는 거 죽기전에 보고싶음 박봄,산다라박,씨엘,공민지 진짜 이 네 사람 활동할때 팬으로서 있던 사람이지만 진짜 언제 들어도 좋음 워낙 이 네 명이 엄청 톡톡하고 국내유일무이 했었던 그룹이라서 더 그런듯
남,녀그룹을 떠나서 그룹컨셉으로 2NE1그룹은 진짜 유일무이 했었음
=
https://youtu.be/-pPgHX_cfGY?t=44
여기 44초부분하고 1분9초부분에서도 음향부분에 문제생기면 손가락으로 톡톡치잖아요;; 마이크 문제 맞구
엠넷이 확인 안 했는지 대충한건지 알고 있었는지...
=
A queen does not compete...she dominates. Yyaaaassss!!!!
=
Imagine the audiences are the real kpop stan since early 2000s... Bom would prolly be winning on this and will surely stay on 1st place. But Bom will stay Queen and Legendary. She be winning since her debut anyway.
=
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
짠하다... 컨디션이 예전의 박봄 같지가 않네...
=
솔직히 이거 마이크 너무한데... 음향 누구야😭😭
=
Hearing this song again made me cry at the very end because Park Bom has come a long way and she deserve all the recognition that  she’s receiving now. I’ve seen her at her best, I’ve seen her at her very low but best of all I’ve seen her rise once more. Black Jack Reunite!
=
i just missed 2ne1 so much, i cried uugghh
=
I MEAN LITERALLY... EVERYONE SANG TO THE SONG IN THE STUDIO!! THIS IS THE POWER OF A TRUE QUEEN
=
이노래 진짜 노래방에서 부르는부르면 
숨쉴부분도없고 음도높고 겁나 어렵던데
... 박봄 대단한거에요 👍🏻
=
몇년 전에는 저 노래를 부를 땐 투애니원 함께였는데 지금은 혼자서 부른다는게 눈물나
=
When everyone is singing edm but park bom is just pure angel vocals
=
Still hoping Park Bom unites 2ne1 on-stage in the last episode. It's gonna be game over.
=
Even though I know that there are a few mistakes here and there, I can't stop coming back to watching this video! I feel chills every single time and I really feel her feelings from the song!
=
Wowww. We're 4M now. Good job to all Bomshells and Blackjacks.
=
She has to win she deserve that. 2ne1 made a lot of merit that today’s kpop’s fame
=
b!tch i’m crying 😭 who with me?😞😭
=
I really got goosebumps listening to her voice... Really miss 2ne1 😭
=
This made me so emotional 😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
Her voice is so unique and beautiful.
=
Yaaaassssssssss brings so much mementoes 😭😭😭😭
=
OMG IM CRYINGGGGGGG😭😭😭
=
Watching this makes me cry I know she is hurt and feeling lonely she's trying not to cry but as a fan of her and 2ne1 I cried a lot miss u bomie
=
3:56 Masterclass from Gen.2 leaves Gen.3 speechless.
=
my 2ne1 heart, i miss my girls! come back home juseyoooo
=
QUEEN!!!! ❤️ I missed you a lot!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
=
1위해도 모자랄판에 5위라니..
=
I cried 😭
=
I'm crying .. She is so strong!!
=
i need 2ne1 in my life.... 😩
=
Im crying 😢
=
PARK BOM EVERYONE. SLAYING. 🔥
=
Queen Bommie showing the youngsters how it’s done
=
Nostalgia for everyone in korea.
=
Still 2ne1 style..

=
BRING BACK OUR 2NE1 PLEASE😭
=
Bommiii.. im always cheering for youuuu
=
우리 봄이 무대에서 더 날아다니고 하고 싶은거 다해~
=
ㅠㅠ최고...
=
1:51 솔라 알아챈듯 마이크 노답인거 ㅋㅋ

It seems that Sola know Bom’s mic is bad.
=
2:26 마이크 가르키는데도 조절 안해준 스텝 진짜 개너무하다
=
AHHH PARK BOMM I MISS YOUUU
=
2:26 에 인이어랑 마이크 두들기잖아...암넷
=
❤❤❤
=
1:04 isn't this sihoon from produce x 101

=
마이크 미친 거 아냐..?
=
첫 소절 'you' 하는데 소름돋았음... 발매 당시 진짜 좋아했던 노래였고 지금도 듣는데ㅠㅠㅠ 박봄 음색 최고다...
=
I miss you so much 😭😭😭💖💖💖
=
2:27 에 보면 마이크 손가락으로 두번 툭툭 치는데 저게 문제있어서 치는거임... 
노래부르는 사람이 제스쳐로 마이크 치면 혹여나 소리들어갈까봐 안하는걸 누구보다 잘알텐데..ㅠㅠ
연차 오래되었다고 더 대우하는거 바라지도 않음 걍 기본만이라도 해줘요..
내 초등학생때 부터의 우상인데 맴아프네
=
솔직히 목소리는 레전드.. YG 지금의 창법은 얘가 원조지.. 랩스타일도 씨엘이 먼저고..
=
I am watching this again and Im still literally crying
=
泣きました😢
=
2ne1 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
아 일 똑바로 안하나,,, 마이크 개구린거 주네

Teddy park he wrote this song I'm very appreciative for her I love this song since she had the first day debut it remind me back the first time I listen this song it a good memories for me! This mv song is very beautiful include choir, church, the handsome man and natural ❤
=
박봄이 얘네랑 비빌 짬인가 ㅋㅋ
=
이노래를 부르는 박봄을 2019년에 또 볼수있어서 기쁘다ㅠ
=
😭
=
I was so sad for her because she said that she is by herself without a group and to see her perform like this made me so happy
=
Mnet better use all their money, power and witchery to make a 2NE1 reunion
=
me wasted after watching this i’m not crying u are
=
박봄 is legend. 박봄 음색, 창법  2NE1TV에 보였던 성격 말투 먹는거 스타일 따라하는 사람들 진짜 많았는데 박봄 특유의 유니크함 오리지널리티의 느낌이 없더라 타고난 사람이 다르긴 다름
=
We miss you forever 2ne1! #youmakemecry 🤟♥️😭
=
Don't care about the crappy rankings, but this vid is the most viewed 😭💖
=
Beautifull 👸👸👸👸
=
The queen is back. Please bring back CL, Dara, Minzy too.
=
Suddenly I miss bodong couple
=
마이크에 문제가  있었던 것 같네. 노래 끊기고 작게 들렸다 크게 들렸다  반복되던데...
=
She doesnt need a choreo.. standing and singing in her beautifull voice make the crowed jaw drop!! She can slay her performance without doing nothing!! Just her pure voice is enough.. indeed a QUEEN 👑
=
Alone and still killing it wonder if all reunite??...forever Badass girl group ever been made in kpop history!! ❤️
=
Seeing you fighting alone makes my heart shatter into pieces 😭😭😭 I really really really miss 2ne1!! At the same time I’m overwhelmed with the Blackjacks spirit! We stan a legend! I’m crying a river.. huhu
=
중간중간 반응 보여주지 말고 그냥 박봄만 풀영상 안되나 ㅠㅠ 좋은데 너무 흐름 끊...ㅠㅠ
=
New kpop fans can't relate with the feelings that we old kpop fans are feeling right nowwwwww.
Okay who's crying with me?? 
We love you Bommieee!!!♥
=
솔직히 박봄은 유앤아이 이 곡 하나로 모든걸 표현했다고 봄 그러기에 더욱 더 특별한 것 같다
=
Have you seen Minzy's latest post on ig where she said she misses blackjacks and Pos everyday? And all other 3 members liked the post? Huhuhu please at least a stage for 2ne1.
=
이러니까 사람들이 멜론을 쓰는거야 엠넷안쓰고 거지같은놈들
=
박봄
=
😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
누가 영어로 박봄문제가아니고 마이크문제라고말해주면안되요??  외국인들이 박봄노래가 하드하다 박봄이 울고싶어서 못했다 이런식으로 커버치고있는데...; 암넷은 마이크 ㅈ같이해서 시청률 뽑는다고 말해주세오
=
그룹에 비해 솔로가 불리하긴 한듯... 그래도 다른 그룹들에 비하면 무대 변화도 거의 없고 대선배라는 거 빼면 아래 많이 받았을 것 같음
=
마이크 아니 왜 저딴걸로 왜 줌 개 빡치네--
=
Really miss yoy
=
words can't describe how painful it feels to be missing 2ne1
=
난 박봄이 대단하다 느끼는게 솔직히 혼자서 무대 채우면 비어보일만도한데 꽉차게 불러주고 나는 1차경연때 5위한게 이해가 안돼서 보러왔는데 진짜 클라스가 넘사다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 많이 노래 불러주세요 💗
=
2:27 문제 있는뎅 ㅠㅠ 봄이 완전 프로여ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I know its impossible for now to have 2ne1.. but hopefully they can perform together in this show...  that would be really great..💕🤘 #justbelievein2ne1 #nolja #2ne1
=
She is calling her fellow Queens
♠️♥️♣️♦️
A Queen's presence: She is just standing there but she is making a hell of an impact!
=
I dont know why Im crying 😭
=
How many goosebumps i had during this 4 min and 24 seconds
=
That was so beautiful I cried at the end... Woah.. 😍✨😭
=
I remember seeing this live and just being brought to tears. Completely unexpected on my part, because Minzy is my bias, but boomie had me shook <3
=
when i heard her voice in the beggining it gave me goosebumps since it's been so long since i heard the song.
=

=
박봄 음색 , 가창력 망치지마라 진짜;
=
I am crying at this performance omg all the memories came up and brought me into tears😭 you deserve the world, park bom💖
=
박봄 화이팅!!너무잘함

=
썸넬 홍진영 인줄
=
Keep streaming
=
This literally makes me cry 😭😭 It really triggered me more to miss 2ne1. 😭😭 You really did well, Park Bom. ❤️😭
=
언니 진짜 너무 멋저요 언니가 어떤 선택을 하건 늘 응원할게요 사랑해요 ㅠㅠ
=
Whats good with the mic...
=
이 무대를 마이크가 망치네....
=
GOOSEBUMPS ALL OVER
=
I'm just crying. Why? This is so beautiful
=
*ARE WE IN HEAVEN ?* yes
=
Queen always queen
=
❤
=
봄이 언니 나 우러.....
=
마이크진짜 거지같은거 줬네
=
you & i = 2ne1&me forever💗
=
대기실 크기 차이 너무 나는데,,
=
Road to another million views!!!!
=
Why am I crying 😭😭😭😭 I MISS 2ne1
=
I'm so happy she gets to perform in this kind of shows that it's making me cry T___T Bom's passion for singing and performing shows. You can see how 2ne1 loves to sing and perform you feel it even if you are not there watching live.
=
I literally goes like this 😭.
QueenBom your performance was so touching & nostalgic. You were there alone in that stage,but then there show your back up singers. It was like YOU and all the Blackjacks  behind you singing along. Fighting!
=
i hope mnet will also create a show/project reuniting disbanded legendary groups and make them perform again.. it will be a history
=
오 이 노래 10주년이네..
리즈시절은 지나갔지만
클라스는 영원하다
2NE1 당대 최고 걸그룹 지금은 해체되고 홀로남았지만 관록있네요
=
I literally crieed.  Her new company is so nice to her
=
중딩때 아이리버 엠피쓰리에 넣어놓고 종일 들었네... 회자 잘 안되는 편인데 저때사람들은 들으면 다 눈물나는노래
=
마이크가 목소리 다 잡아먹어서 코먹는 소리 남...
=
마이크 실화냐; 끊기는 거 봐 박봄이 잘못 부르는 줄,,
=
just imagine when the door opens, one by one, CL, Minzy and Dara appears while singing as a background singer and then suddenly along with Bom they would sing the song with her as 2NE1 😢😭
=
Whenever 2ne1 or one of them’s performing it will always feel like a concert.
=
Seeing the views went up really quick means the rest of the blackjacks all over the world are waking up?
=
😍😍😍
=
무대 정말 기대해서 들어봤는데 뭔가 위화감이 들어서 이어폰 껴서 다시 들으니 엥 마이크 상태 왜 이래ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 일부러 안 부르는건가 했던 부분은 마이크가 끊겨서 안 들리는 거였고 전체적으로  호흡 문제로 보일 정도로 심각해요.. 가수도 아닌 일반인인 제가 노래방 가서 저런 마이크 만나도 짜증나는데 가수가 경연 무대에서 저런 마이크로 불러서 공연에 방해된다면 얼마나 속상하겠어요... 제작진 분들 마이크 상태 확인 확실하게 부탁드려요 ㅠㅠ
=
Why i'm cry😥😢😢😢
=
진짜 아이돌들의 아이돌 아니냐고,,,ㅠㅠㅜㅠ 눈물나
=
박봄 노래부르는거 보니까 노래방가고싶어졌음 학창시절의 추억을 일깨워주는 명곡이다😭
=
im not cryin over this omg
=
I burst out into tears when her voice came out.....Park Bom and 2Ne1 are just literally one of the best idols that exist in the kpop industry.....those memories with the girls really hit me hard with the feels
=
2NE1 완전체였으면 대박이였을거같은데😭
=
I really thought other 2ne1 was gonna show up :((.
=
My childhood song 
Her voice still and really amazing
=
엠넷이 아니라 암넷이다.. 마이크 이상한거 대기실에 있는 다른 그룹들도 눈치채고 언급했겠지만 그건 싹다 편집하고 자기들이 원하는 반응만 올렸겠지..
2:39 솔라 표정 굳는거랑 2:42 미미 표정만 봐도 마이크 이상한거 다 눈치챔
Mnet is so vindictive... The other groups in the waiting room must ve noticed that sth was wrong with bom’s mic and probably mentioned it but Mnet edited all out
u can see from solar’s expression at 2:39 and mimi’s expression at 2:42
=
Malaysian Bomshells and Blackjacks where you at?? 🇲🇾💚❤️💜💛
=
Hi Mnet! This video surpassed 1M views. That’s 1 out of 4 of 2ne1. What more if 2ne1 is complete? Please make them reunite in your show. This could be a hit! 🙏🏼 You made it once in 2015. Please do magic, sorcery, witchcraft or whatever you call it to make this dream happen. 🙏🏼 I’m begging you. 😭😭😭
=
박봄은전설이지
=
I genuinely loved this performance. Although it wasn’t perfect because of the mic issues and her occasional straining while singing. She gave it her all and commanded the attention of everyone in the audience. I believe that what makes a singer great. You can have outstanding vocals and no presence on stage. But, if you don’t have stage presence your performance on stage becomes one dimensional. Being a singer is more than just vocals it’s a visual art as well. My former choir director said something similar regarding stage presence to me before but, I never understood what she meant by that until now. Park Bom made me realize that through this performance.
=
마이크 문제있다고 손가락으로 톡톡 사인 주는데?????
=
She‘s so slim but why her clothes doing her like that? But once a queen always a queen👸
=
21
=
마이크가 정신나갔네 지혼자 강약조절을 무슨 트로트꺽는수준으로 하네
=
🙌👏😊😆
=
박봄 노래실력 마이크가 다망치네 ㅉ 마이크좀 좋은거줘라
박봄 정도면 존나좋은거줘라
=
Only her alone for all of the other member....blackjacks we can help her....
=
IBK에서 주관한 콘서트가 참콘이었나..? 암튼 그런데 거기에 봄언니 나왓었거든요••• 사촌이랑 같이 갔는데 라이브로 무대 씹어서 너무 벅차고 콘서트 특유의 그 울림이 너무 서글파사 둘이 같이 손 꼭 붙잡았는데 저만 엉엉 울었던 기억이••••• 한 반년 즈음 된 거 같긴 하지만 봄언니 실력 아직 안 죽었어요... 마이크때문에 그래요ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Bài này thật sự là huyền thoại!!!
=
Just crying for Park Boom while listening to this song! Think abt her career n myself!! Since i was a girl, i was super love her voice!!! Now, i cant believe my queen comes back!! Tears keep dropping

=
And then I cried ..... I miss 2ne1 so much

Park bom voice is my favorite in the Kpop industry, its very unique, no need for auto tune.

=
2:27 마이크 이상있다는 제스쳐인거 같네요
=
i m tearing up aswell
=
Honestly. She's so different from A LOT of new artists and IM IN LOVE WITH THAT. It's so special to her. Her voice and everything. It sounds so youthful and yet filled with....ugh i dont know how to explain it. I haven't really seen much of her singing but it's precious.
=
눈물 날거 같아..
=
Uff que recuerdos bonitos me trae esa canción <3 ojala y gané mi reina <3

박봄에게 실력논란이라니 이게 웬말...?...
=
SHE IS ALREADY THE QUEEN EVEN BEFORE THIS WHOLE QUEENDOM THING!🔥
=
〒_〒 my heart 
Bomieyahhhh. .  
2ne1
=
전보다 목상태가 많이 안 좋아진듯..
=
눈물날거같아.....
=
아 중요한 봄님 무대인데 마이크 문제 개 크네
=
오우
=
아니 나는 퀸덤 대충 보고 박봄 심사위원이어서 특별 공연 한 줄 알았음
=
Blackjacks unamonos para dar apoyo a bomi <3
=
이때 귀가 행복했지 박봄의 한목소리가 풀곡이어서
=
以前喜歡2ne1 就是因為朴春的聲音
=
무대시작 0:48
=
🔥🔥🔥👑👑👑👑
=
Todos os grupos foram incríveis,mas eu realmente não consigo aceitar que essa performance,apesar de simples,ganhou o 5° lugar apenas,sinto q a Bom merece mais ❤️🇧🇷
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I always play 2nd gen song in my shop/store. I love this song so much, I repeat it too often. Youngsters walking by always like what Kpop is that? Like hello its Queen Bom
=
이노래 힘들때 들었었는데 뮤비버전이 청순버전이라 좀 진정성없어 보였죠. 락버전으로 한번 더 박봄 화이팅
=
She is literally like the saviour of kpop with all the choir in the background😭😭
=
잃어버린 줄 알았던 10년 전에 찍은 스티커사진을 서랍 깊숙한 곳에서 찾은 기분이다
=
this performance performance is emotional not just for park bom but also to all blackjacks, im not crying u are
=
어떤분 이야기보고 보니까 2분26초에 진짜 인이어랑 마이크 툭툭치는구나 목상태가 최상은아니였지만 음향도 꾸지긴했나보네ㅜㅜㅜ 그래도 잘했어ㅜㅜㅜ
=
😭😭😭😭😭
=
OMG I'M CRYING :'( SHE IS ALWAYS LEGEND MAIN VOCAL!!!
=
아진짜왜눈물나냐...박봄도 눈물 참았을거같다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ고마워요
=
Newer kpop fans don’t know how we feel about our queens
=
No one can replace her
Also 2ne1
=
어릴때 기억이 잔뜩 묻어있는 노래라 눈물날거같다
=
😭😭😭
=
If Park Bom becomes invited in MAMA this year, I bet she'll bring other 2ne1 sisters.
=
멋져  굿굿
=
퀸덤을 통해 2ne1 볼 수 있으면 좋겠다ㅜ..
정말루 힘들때 이노래 들으면 힘이되요 
2ne1 화팅 ㅜㅜ
=
봄이 넘 안타깝다 진짜 꽃길만 걸었으면 좋겠다
=
she's so brave to stand alone in this stage singing that song which has so many memories attached to it. i hope we can witnessed another comeback this year. in 2019 she appeared more than in yg years
=
🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
=
Let’s face it we all cried through this!! She’s coming out on top (regardless if she wins or not). 2019 is BOM’s year!!
=
I do miss my high school life and miss 2ne1 so much 😢😢 Thanks Park Bom for this amazing show.
=

=
Queen bom deserve everything in this world.. I'm a sone and I'm gettin emotional watching this performance 💚🥰😭
=
개인적으로 투애니원 팬이었고 이노래를 수없이 들어봤었지만 이번무대는 특히나 뭔가 박봄이 힘들게 부르는것같이 들렸음ㅜㅜ
=
パフォーマンスに感動してるわけじゃないよね、、、顔の変化が酷過ぎて💦悲しくなってしまう、、、豊胸も、やり過ぎだよ、、。
=
Nostalgia.. this song won best digital single in MAMA 2010. Feels so proud, not to mention they bagged 2 daesang, album & artist of the year plus female group award and best music vid. Miss my 2ne1 ajummas 😭😭😭 legends.

I cried during the whole thing, not even joking... I miss 2ne1
=
마이크 야 야
=
Wtf MNET give her a proper mic I can hear the mic is not working well and ruining her performance 😭😭🤦🏻‍♀️
=
와 미쳤어 눈물냠;
=
💜
=
KKKKKKK
=
I feel like bom is fighting more than anyone in this competition. SHE is all alone but standing tall. Every time she performs here I just feel so proud of her.
=
박봄그대 목소리는 마치..보물  보석 같은 느낌..
=
와....딱 전주들리는순간 개소름돋앗다...딱 암전됫을때 2ne1 멤버들 다나왓으면 진짜....
=
I miss them
=
마으크 뭐지?
=
Even the other contestants recognized her song and been a fan of her.
=
Bom we will always love you😭😭😭😭😘😘
=
마이크 ㅈㄴ 개똥같은데도 저렇게 부르는 박봄이 대단함. 이악물고 소리 잘낼려고 노력했을꺼 노래 부르는 사람이라면 공감함.
=
Cant help but think she worries about her mic. There was a moment when she tapped it. Good thing nothing major happened. Suguhaesss~
=
O my god...i'm crying with her voice😭😭😭feels like it's been so long missing 2ne1😭
=
I was long time ago when i heard that everyday and cry a lot with the music video
=
그냥 박봄노래하는것만 쭉 나오게해주지 자꾸 방청석 비추고 대기실 비추고 이런편집 너무싫다
=
와 박봄이다 눈물날뻔
=
마이크가.. 음악에 관심없는 사람이 들어도 마이크가 문제인게 딱 티가난다..
=
Just so you all know, she was having a problem hearing herself that's why she kept reaching around her back. She was trying to adjust her in-ear monitor. She even pointed at her mic at around 2:24 to signal the audio crew. :)
=
근데 궁금한건 이건 걸그룹끼리 대결을 하는건데 박봄은 예전에는 걸그룹이였어도 이제는 솔로로 활동하는데 왜 걸그룹끼리 대결하는 프로에 나온거지???? pd한테 함 물어보고싶다
=
Park Bom be like: Hey 3rd Generation Groups, this is how a 2nd Generation Main Vocalist sounds like. 
Gaaaaahd!!! Her vocals never changed at all!! And i've missed her singing so much!!
=
All I can say is "Goosebumps". Woaahh the Chills! Keep fighting Park Bom! ❤️
=
Simple yet jaw dropping. Huehue
=
My Bommie never fails to give chills on everyone.  Her voice is a blessing from the heaven.  Keep fighting, Bommie!  We are here to support you!  We love you!
=
This is a historic stage in Kpop history, already.
=
2:27 her mic was having some issues, she's so professional handling problems on stage
=
Only kind hearted people and cool will stay for her.. Others with unpure soul can leave and will be cancelled. TQ
=
Whenever I hear Bom sings, I feel like Dara, CL and Minzy are with her.
=
ITS OVER FOR YOU BITCHES WHEN 2NE1 COMES BACK
=
암전 후에 산다라박 공민지 씨엘 뒤에 있으면 개씹소름일텐데
=
Weren’t mamamoo and Bom on a team together? Or was she joking? 😂
=
See you in the Philippines this September QUEEN. Hoping you sing this song or perform Spring with Dara. 💝
=
마이크 상태 이상해서 아쉽다 아
=
I really want to have english subs for this. I wanna know how the other groups appreciate Queen Bom💕
=
아니 엠넷 장난치냐
=
go boomie👸👸
=
Im hoping for a surprise that all of 2ne1 can gather again together and perform on this stage
=
Among the 6 participants of Queendom,  Park Bom has the biggest international fandom (Blackjacks and Bomshells). We are outside Korea, so we can't do voting nor attend one of the queendom episodes. All we can do is stream her videos on youtube because it has an impact and points as what the criteria of the contest says. So please let's stream her videos uploaded by Queendom,  let's support and help her. Nolza!
=
You don't know you miss it until you listen to it... #BOM ❤️❤️❤️
=
마이크가 안좋아서 이 다음부터 개인 마이크 가지고 나오는건가..
=
I love you.
=
go park bom
=
I was in mid school when i heard this song & now i'm mom to my son & still can't get enough of this song ❤
=
*BOM*
*DARA*
*CL*
*MINZY*
*2NE1*
*BLACKJACK*
=
my first kpop grup that i love is not bigbang nor snsd but it is 2ne1. and i love them so much.
=
Why i'm crying😭
I'm so proud the legend park bom fighting!
=
I got it. That's how kpop world is, right now. As long as they like you they will support you. How sad. If that is the case why they should have to perform if in the end its up on how many people will support them because they know them but not because they are more talented and have a great performance than others. But still it's okay as long as we see our queen Bom performing and enjoying on stage. Hope that she can bring her members 💖.
=
OMG THIS SONG 😭😭😭💙
=
i cried when her sing this song ,love you bomㅠ
=

=
Bom with her voice, both are so beautiful!
=
I have always and forever loved her! Dara and Park Bom are my all time female idol! While I still dreaming abt Daragon, Park Bom came back strongly and brought me back to all these beautiful memories :(. Why is it so difficult for them to be happy and successful??? They deserve better

=
명불허전...!!!!
=
노래는 겁나 좋고 다 좋은데 마이크....ㅠ 나왔다안나왔다...
가리키기까지 했는데...그래도 좋다..♡
=
(G)idle and Bom😍
=
엠넷....마이크좀...
=
Soy yo o boom estaba nerviosa! :(
=
Just OMG
=
눈물나네,,,,   봄이는   음색이  귀한데   잘관리햐서  오래보자
=
와 초등학교때 변성기 오기전엔 개잘불럿었는데.
엌 내목소리 어디감 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I miss her sound....So special!
=
Queen Park Bom👑
=
omo i really miss 2ne1😢😢😢
=
We all know Park Bom is the queen
=
아니...박봄언니 마이크 상태 왜 이런데;;;
=
I LOVE IT
=
I can't wait for next episode
=
Why whyyy ,, suddenly so sensitive. 😭😭😭
=
얼굴그만해요 예전얼굴으로돌아왔으면좋겠어요ㅠ
=
the real queen👑
=
Rosé covered this on the Blackpink tour, I just realised
=
중간중간 쉬는 게 아니라 마이크 상태 때문에 끊기는 거 같은데 뭐하셨어요 엠넷 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 기대를 져버리질 않네 실력으로 커버 해서 다행이지
=
❤️🥰🥰😭😭😭
=
너무조암......
=
와 진짜 성형은 절대 중독되면 안되야겠다 심하네
=
마이크좀;
=
เสียงแบบนี้มีคนเดียวจริงๆนะ ถึงหน้าจะเปลี่ยนแค่ไหน แต่เสียงไม่มีเปลี่ยน โตมากับ 2ne1 เด้
=
Make me crying
=
마이크왜저래;;
=
음색이 좀 다른데?
=
퀸같다 여왕 여왕 ,,,,,
=
🥰🥰
=
박봄의 성량에 비해 마이크가 작다
=
처음에 얼굴이뻐는되
=
진짜 박봄은 YG의 피해자중 한명이다 양싸가 계속한 외모비하발언에 자존감 낮아지고 선택했던 것이 성형인데 잘못되는 바람에 퇴물소리 듣고, 마약사건 터졌을때 YG가 블랙핑크 데뷔 준비한다고 신경을 못써줘서 대처를 잘 못해서 이상한 소문이 사실이 되어버리고 (실제로 박봄이 복용했던 약은 미국에서 항우울제로 쓰고있는 대표적인 말이고 외할머니집으로 배송했다 젤리류로 배송했다는 말도 후에 전부 거짓으로 밝혀짐. 무엇보다 박봄이 섭취한 항우울제가 마약성분이 있다고 하지만 실제 마약성 물질은 0.6% 함유되어 있었음) 재정비하고 컴백했는데 악플 달리고.. 진짜 박봄은 YG의 피해자중 한명이다 진심
=
She's very confident and comfortable in this performance. My Queen!!!!
=
I hope Bom will bring 2NE1's stage on this show
=
박봄 목상태가 안좋든 마이크 문제가 있든 언제 들어도 이 노래는 진짜 향수다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 미쳤다 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
마이크가 소리 먹는 거 같은뎅
=
Why did I feel sad and cry when she was standing on the stage to perform alone?.. I miss 2ne1 😭
=
When the thing open I thought the other members will come and perform together and my heartbeat beated fast!! But I was wrong but I had feelings the group is gonna perform together later
=
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 레전드 무대 하나 또 찍었다 근데 목상태가 예전같지 않은 것 같아서 마음아프고ㅠㅠㅠ
=
If 2NE1 join at Queendom, what do you think will happen????? ✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻😢😢
=
3rd generation groups still have so much respect for 2nd generation singers  ITS SO BEAUTIFUL 😭😭😭
=
Cl should leave yg, collect her girls and together conquer the kpop industry.🔥🔥
=
투애니원을 어떻게 이겨ㅋㅋㅋㅋ fire 하나로 알아서 다 눈 깔아 수준인데ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:26 분명 익숙한 노래인데 왜 이렇게 이상하게 들리나 싶었더니 마이크에 문제 있던 건가요...?ㅠㅠ 저거 손가락으로 마이크 두어 번 치는 거 장비 이상하다고 사인 보낸 거 맞죠?? 안타깝네요 ㅠㅠ
=
Aaahhh Bomie!!! Why am I crying while watching this? This song brings back a lot of memories! I miss the girls so much 😭😭😭😭 #Proud #Blackjack
=
진짜 박봄 목소리는 마음을 울리는게 있는것같다. 향수라는말이 맞는것같아 넘므좋아
=
2ne1 2019 pls!!!!!! 🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭😭
=
MNET, PLEASE REUNITE 2NE1 ON THIS PROGRAM!!!
=
I'll always be grateful of D-Nation for helping Bom get back up to her feet and sing again. Thank you so much
=
마이크 상태 이상하게 들리는 거 나뿐인가?
=
마이크가 너무 구리다..  박봄만 그런게 아니라 마마무도  계속 끊김..  좋은 것 좀 쓰지
=
Queen!!
=
다들 마이크 문제 언급하는데 마이크문제 없는거면 부른사람이 좀 민망할듯 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
ทำไมหน้าบวมจัง
=
아 진심 왜 이러냐???????
=
박봄 10년차이나는 후배들 사이에서 처음부터 시작하는 느낌이라 너무 맘 아프다
=
Im cry :'(((((
=
마이크상태 왜저따구야 개빡치네 봄언니 노래 돌려내
=
You and I together ❤️💖💖❤️😘
=
얼굴 왜그래 ? 무샤워
=
I had to swallow back tears.. who cut onions in here :,( my girl Bommie deserves this and so much more 💝
=
please come back 2NE1  ... IM Madly crying
=
This song is really nostalgic. It reminds me of my childhood when the Internet wasn’t available in my area yet and the only way to listen to this song was waiting for the radio to broadcast it. I don’t even remember how much time I spent every night beside my little radio hearing this song before going to bed. Now everything has changed but it’s still broken-hearted to see 2NE1- a legend Kpop girl group disbanding. There are many unique girl groups currently, but basically none of them gives me the feelings that 2NE1 used to.
=
Did BJs really stop streaming all of a sudden?!
=
I cried when I heard that first note 😭 the Queen Park Bom
=
I feel like crying too!! 😭😭😢😢 I miss 2NE1!
=
O:01 wow it's feel like nostalgia
1:12 i don't cry, really😭😭😭
=
Can’t wait next eps when she cover another group 😍😍😍
=
I'm so sorrry, I cried so much 😭
=
For the whole duration of this video, I just legit cried to my heart content. I really miss the four of them performing. And everytime those kpop idols react backstage, my reaction was always "same girl, same". I really want 2ne1 to be together again. This perf was so beautiful and yeah, nostalgic. Go Bom! 💖 OT4 #FOURever
=
Omg! Why am i tearing up 😭😭😭😭
=
Where can I see the full ep or know where to watch the clips from?
=
And i'm missing 2ne1 now:')
=
She's brave enough to stand and sing alone. 👏👏👏😭
=
I'm cry :'(
=
I know,this is so amazing and pure,I always love bom voice since I knew 2ne1,and always I love her voice and personality,love you so much park bom
=
Im SONE. im support you boom. you queen with snsd and 2ne1.  love u.
=
i From VietNam Love Korea <3
=
Im cry and miss you Bom :(
=
박봄❤️ 나의 10대 ㅠㅠ 
항상 봄날만 있길 응원해요
=
Share this bomshells❤
=
My eyes... Omg! I cried so hard.. I miss them..
=
The last part gave me goosebumps
=
Its OK to be placed 5th, remember this is the first round, she'll slowly regained more k-fans again
=
Ayyy Park Bom tiene una hermosa voz 😭😭😭 me hizo llorar wowww 🔥🔥🙆💕💞💕

=
스타카토냐 부분 뮤트냐 창법왜저뤠...
=

=
Ohmygod. I can't stop crying...

=
첫소절부터 소리질렀다
=
봄아 사랑해 ❤️ 기죽지말고 당당하게 잘 했으면 좋겠어 우리한텐 늘 박봄이 최고야 늘 혼자가 아니고 함께라고 생각했으면 좋겠어 영원히 함께해 노래해줘서 고마워  ❤️❤️

마이크가 안좋은것도 있는 분
=
마이크 계속 뚝뚝 끊기는데 공연 끝나고 대기실 왔을 때 진짜 억울했겠다..
=
마이크가 딱 듣기에도 너무 심한데 ㅡㅡ
=
근데 약간 대기실마다 차이가 있는건갓,,?
=
what's wrong with the microphone?:(
=
티아라도 나오면 좋겠어요.그런데 명곡 너무 맗은데요
=
Hoping dara, cla and minzy will join her😭😭😭its gonna be epic
=
Gosh time flies by too fast
=
혼자나와도 저렇게 감동주고 무대가 꽉 채워지는 느낌을 주는거보면 진짜 박봄은 대박이다 사랑해요 언니
=
박봄 예전에 마약논란있지 않았어요? 그때 이후로 좀 불호감이였는데...
=
love u bommie
=
마이크에 문제가 있나?
=
4,000,000 Go...GOOO...Go... 💚
=
마이크가 개쓰레기;
=
Lovely park bom
=
😍😍😍😍😍
=
박봄 카리스마 넘치는건 맞는데 좀 더 노력하는게 좋을듯
=
마이크 안나온다고 사인보냈는데... 이걸무시하네
=
Any one else came from Rose cover ?
=
목소리는 좋다 근데 얼굴이 왤캐 바뀐느낌이지
=
👑♥️
=
I miss her a lot
=
She just stands there.
=
I just started crying when she sang. The nostalgia hit me so hard. This is just Park Bom, imagine what would've happened if this was the whole of 2NE1. I miss them a lot.
=
1:03 That fanchant at the back make me cry🤧.
=
👌
=
아... 박봄 안타깝다 원래 훨씬 더 잘부렀던 거 같은데
=
정말 오랜만에 무대에 섰는데 관객이 다 따라불러주면 얼마나 감동일까.....
=
2009😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
음향 최선이냐? 본방보는데 진짜 어이가 없어서 화가 다나더라...
감히 어디서 돈주고 보지도 못하는 박봄 레전드무대 방송을 이따구로 내놔? 개짜증나네...
얼평하는 얼라들은 좀 빠져라; 가치를 모르면 씨부리질 마세요..^^ 그저 이쁘면 단줄 아는 철없고 무식한것들;
=
Even after such a beautiful performance. Bommie only placed 5th!? WTH is this voting system.
=
아니 여기 왤케 박봄노래하는거 힘들어보인다는 댓글들 많냐 박봄 전성기때 투애니원활동하면서 노래불렀을때 기억안나냐 옛날부터 박봄은 저렇게 불렀어 유튭으로 과거영상들 보고 비교해서 들어보셈 똑같음 저게 쟤 발성임... 원래 저런목소리랑 발성아니였는데 양현석이 연습생때부터 박봄 특이하게 불러야 뜬다고해서 저렇게 연습시켜서 지금 그런거임 원래 저렇게 벅차듯이 불러
=
She did not deserve to be in 5th. This performance was iconic. She emoted her heart and soul into this performance and I can feel the depth. It may not be the freshest concept but she delivered it regardless. She deserved to be in the top 3 imo. However she looks like she is having fun. That’s all that matter to me. I’m just happy to see her sing and be happy.  ❤️
=
2:26 보면 마이크 두드리네 음향이 정말 안 좋았나 봐
=
마이크가 제대로 안나오네 중간중간 계속 끊김
=
Most idols on this show grew up listening to the 2nd gen sunbaes like 2NE1, SNSD, Kara, Wonder Girls etc. This performance must mean a lot to them.
=
평생 다시는 못들을 것만 같았던 노래를 듣게되어서 너무 감동이에요 이게 뭐라고 이리 벅찬지.. 박봄 응원하고 많은 곡 내주세요!!
=
박봄 노래는 보고 있으면 불안정하고 위태로운데 휘청일 듯 절대 안 쓰러지고 계속 이어지는 느낌이 듦...그게 좋ㅇㅏ
=
Legendary Girl Group will always be legendary no matter they are doing SOLO or as a GROUP.
=
솔로지만 무대를 꽉채우는 박봄은 도덕책....
=
สู้เขานะคะ #queenbom
=
마이크 음질 좀 안좋은 것 같아서 아쉽다 ㅠㅠ 그래도 가창력으로 커버치는게 진짜 대단하다
=
#2 trending in korea , She is the only one with unique voice tone in kpop industry .
=
음향이 너무 이상한데? 봄이 이거 완창 못하겠냨ㅋㅋㅋ 수백번 불렀을텐데

=
엠넷 암넷이네 그냥 마이크 제대로 전달 안하냐  울 박봄언냐 노래 제대로 듣고 싶다고 개팟치게 마이크 왜 저딴거 줘
=
She is already a queen. No competition to define her.

She needs to gain confidence, and through this show, she gets it.. it doesn't matter if she didn't win, as long she happy
=
I love u BOM
=
I wasn’t a huge BlackJack, but I’ve always enjoyed 2NE1’s music & respect the legacy they left & how much they paved the way for the kpop community 💛
=
2NE1 miss
=
I used to listen this song everyday when i'm like 13 years old
Its good to see she performing this song
=

=
눈물날거 같다 ㅜㅜ 그와중에 마이크 이상한 상태에서도 잘하네 ㅜㅜ

음향을 탓하기엔 다른 가수들은 곧 잘했음

=
실력이 좋은건 뭐라 못하겠지만 아무래도 세대 차이가 있는거같다
=
before im really sad seeing sandara park working alone and seeing that video of boom alone on practice room makes it more harder for me as a fan of 2ne1... but atleast sandara and boom in the industry together makes me happy
=
I MISS HER VOICE (T.T) WHO IS CRYING?
=
Now I know how heaven looks like
=
💗💗💗
=
노래는 솔직히 옛날보단...잘 모르겠음 목소리는 여전히 좋긴 한데.. 그나저나 이미 변한 얼굴가지고 자꾸 뭐라 하는 것도 진짜 나쁜 짓인 것 같다 그만들 했으면
=
다리는 여전히 이쁘네
=
노래는 잘하네 근데 성형은 그만하시길 
여기서 더 망가지면 안되요
=
Brb gonna cry in a corner. Damn feelssssss.
=
주변 동료가수들이 좋은말 많이 해주는군요 시청자 입장에선 참으로 안타갑네요 예전 박봄으로 돌아갔으면...
=
2NE1 reunion 2020 - make it happen!
=
나 왜 눈물나....?
=
Gua malah suka sama penontonnya soalnya penonton laki" Pada ganteng dan lucu
=
oh no, more plastic surgery!!! leave yo lips alone, gurl!
=
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
=
난 이래서 음악이 싫다
멜로디가 나오고 좋은 노래가 나오는 순간 그 분위기가 모든걸 용서하게됨
음악은 너무 치사하다
=
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
PARK BOM WORLD TOUR PLEASEEE
=
성괴 ㅋㅋ
=
Dear mnet, let the international fans vote and we'll show you how blackjacks would bring Park Bom her own Queendom. #QueenBom forever
=
votes dont matter, she's a queen since forever.. we intl blackjacks will take care of the views.. We love you Bommie!! Fighting!!! Just enjoy and we always got your back!!
=
마이크가 다 담을수없을정도로 역량이 뛰어난거다
=
우리시대 디바지
=
I cried because of this stage.
Her voice is so beautiful to say a word.
...And i miss 2ne1...😢😢
=
박봄이 음향감독에게 마이크 문제 있다고 사인 보내는거 같네요. 마이크 두드리는 장면 2:27
=
아무것도 모를 나이에 듣던 노래를 이렇게나 커버린 내가 다시 라이브로 듣고 있다는 거에서 너무 ㅜㅜ 아련하고 눈물 날 거 같어 ㅜㅜ
=
크.....음색봐라 요즘가수들한테선 찾아볼수없는 음색이다
=
내가 무슨일 설현이한테 있었나? 얼굴이...
=
I'm not a blackjack and  i've never heard this song before. But today i'm literally crying to this performance. Parkbom deserve better 😭😭😭❤️
=
not lying, i cried. this song alone brings so much memories TT
=
YOU AND I 2019 VERSION 😭😭😭
GOOSEBUMPS ALL OVER 😭😭😭
I'M CRYING RAINBOWS 😭😭😭
WE SO PROUD OF YOU BOM 😘😘😘
MY BLACKJACK HEART IS FULL 💖♠️💖
=
ME LLORÉ LA VIDA ENTERA Y MÁS. TAN HERMOSA MI AMOR, LA AMO UN MONTÓN 😭❤️❤️
=
마이크도 마이크인데 항상 말나오는게 음색은 독보적인데 자기 노래를 버거워함. 음원은 미치는데 라이브하면 항상 뭔가 아쉽더라고.. 이번 무대뿐만 아님..
=
봄이나이가몃이지.얼굴이 안조아보이네
=
Those 3 Lights on 3:10 Part is like Cl, Minzy, Dara’s Soul and like its give a Power to Bom! 
#4Lights #2NE1 #Queen #PowerBOMb
=
As much as i want to say good things about this, i’m gonna skip that because I’ve been watching this nonstop! And i know i’m not the only one but.. hey! Keep watching till the end and keep on supporting park bom on this! Votes and views are big help for her!!!! Please lets all give this to her. I know it will increase her confidence more. Thank youu.
=
The power of Park Bom alone. 
I hope YG is choking to death for the mistreatment of 2NE1. I will never let this go, never.
#2NE1DeservedBetter
=
I really cried i couldn't control my tears. I wished for a moment that when the lights got off 2ne1 will be together on the stage again T--T ♥
=
when the mc introduced her as the main vocal of the legendary group 2NE1 i had goosebumps
=
Love you bom from Cambodia fan
=
스케줄이나 소속사 문제때문에 바래만보지만.. 마지막에 암전되고 나오는 코러스를 세팀으로 나눠서 오오오~ 세번할때 팀들 리더를 씨엘 다라 민지로 한팀씩 핀조명 쏴서 등장했으면 울컥했을듯ㅜㅜㅜ행복한 상상..
=
Let's not lose hope!! 
WE WILL SEE A 2NE1 STAGE ON THIS SHOW!
=
Its not her 100%, but yet delivered an amazing  Performance. WHAT A QUEEN👍🏼🙌🏼😭😭😭💚🌸👑
=
Only a true queen and a legend can slayed a performance by just standing only.
=
장난하냐 마이크
=
마이크 왜이래;;;;;박봄만 욕먹게
=
박봄이 노래를못하는게아니라 마이크문제맞음 2:28초쯤보면 박봄이 마이크이상하다고 손가락으로 툭툭건드리잖슴 박봄도 마이크문제있는거 알고 저런수신호했는데 제작진뭐햤냐
=
Don’t care if they aren’t together anymore but I’ll still stay a blackjack and Park Bom still remains my ultimate bias.
=
I want my 2ne1
=
론리론리 로 일등 한번은 하겠지
=
마이크 신경좀 써주기를 제발 ㅡㅡ
=
I'm cry
=
Her voice worth more than everything. Even she struggle with lymph nodes, she still sounds amazing tho. Im glad she sings again.
=
The cute guy in 3:56 is killing meeeeee!!!
=
SIHUUUNNNN 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
I never listened to her music or 2NE1 but I really like her voice
=
우느라 노래 못부른줄 알았는데 마이크문제,;;돌았나 엠넷
=
Bring on online votes open to international fans. Let’s see then who’s the real queen 🔥 Lee Da Hee didn’t introduce Bom to be a LEGENDARY GLOBAL artist for nothing 👸🏻👸🏻👸🏻👸🏻
=
I literally cry every time she performs
=
This makes me miss 2ne1 soooooooo much, I'm crying omgggg, I rlly want 2ne1 back 😫😫😭😭❤ 
I love bom song soo much
=
난 사실 마이크가 어쩌든 그냥 이 무대가 좋았는데👀❤
=
2NE1 will always be my one and only ! I really want them together performing on stage. Please God make it happen. And Give bommie all strength to fight against this hate. 
Blackjacks this is only the way we can support park bom. Please watch this now and again.
=
This is so *NOSTALGIC* My childhood is suddenly CLICKING EVERYTHING
=
Its sad to see her alone :'(
=
Jsjs, me estoy chutando los anuncios para intentar sobornar al Mnet y a ver si le suben la puntuación a Bommie :v
=
The feels 😭😭😭
=
Love​ Bom​ forever​ ❤️💕
=
Hope dara or cl or minzy join her in queendom.. I really like the blending of their voices.. park bom voice is good but not attractive for me when she's on solo.
=
I think next she'll invite Dara to sing Spring 😍.. I hope next Dara, there will be CL, Minzy & the complete 2NE1
=
I felt chills and I started crying. Power of park bom.
=
She's so amazing but i feel sad:((
#2ne1 #blackjack
=
My Beautiful bommie😍😭❤️
=
Remember when she used to be YG Vocal Queen in that era. This is so sad. Look how beautiful and shinning she is
=
Who else still streaming this??
=
*All of the other groups performance amazed me, but this one "Park Bom" really made me teary eyed salute QUEEN*
=
Keep streaming
=
Why I am crying?
=
i miss the old Bom from this song...
she is really so different that is it almost looking at a different person..
=
투에니원은 뭔가 모두의 아픈 손가락이 된거같아요ㅜㅜ 완전체를 볼수있는 그날까지🙏
=
My Queen Park Bom
=
박봄 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 눈물난다 진짜 너무 보고싶었어
=
Always here waiting for live performance of Bommie!!!💖
=
i'm crying. miss them wish we can see them together in one stage
=
지금얼굴에서 입술필러만 녹이면 이쁠것같다 ㅠㅠ
=
Park bom should in top 3
=
박봄 사랑해요!!!!><
꽃길만 걷자!!!♡♡
=
Out of 6 performance this is the most painful to watch... Its too painful to see park bom alone... N she need to sing the song in 2ne1 golden era... How she supposed to to feel up on stage... She must be fight against her tears to finished it... I pray u the best Boomie... U r awesome... Love the voice
=
마이크 문제 있다고 가수가 직접 마이크까지 터치해줬는데 못알아먹어...?
=
I'll be honest. I was very nostalgic listening to the song, but after I heard it the second time, I listened to past performances and found that she's not entirely the same. She used to sing the same song with ease, but now she really needs to push it out.
=
Literally her first 10 seconds of vocalization in the dark made me want to cry. Damn that power 😭😭😭
=
Queen you and i 인줄 알고 들어왔네
=
뭐야 엠넷 마이크 제대로 해줘
=
Hi Yang Hyun Suk, yah watchin this?
=
where are you Blackjacks?? Park Bom is calling
=
LITERAL GOOSEBUMPS BOOOM
=
芊葉火鍋
=
음향문제 아니라 박봄 실력이 별로라는 사람들 이거 한번씩만 보고 오셈 
아니 ㄹㅇ 마이크문제인데 일주일내내 욕먹는거 보니까 내가 다 안타깝네;;
https://youtu.be/vHCpGGbm0Zs
=
This is si beautiful
=
Lo siento, pero no puedo evitar pensar en carmen de mairena cuando veo su cara JAJSJSJSJAJSJSJ
=
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
=
음정이고 나발이고 마이크가 안나오는데? M net은 일하는게 뭐에요? 영상보다가 마이크가 이렇게 구린적은 첨이네
=
OH YES LIVE VOCALS
=
hate to admit, upon watching it again and again, im still tearing and hoping even 2ne1 wont perform here, but somewhere they will again, be back together
=
甘業火鍋
=
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
=
여러모로 아쉽네...ㅜ
=
근데 마이크 진짜 좀 심각한데??
=
what is going on with the hairstylist??????? 😠
=
음향 왜 저래 ... 박봄 한테 왜구래
=
마이크 감안하고 봐도 오래된 노래라 그런지 발음이나 호흡위치가 좀 달라진것 같아서 이질감이 많이느껴짐 그래서 최근영상 찾아봤는데 실력은 죽지않음 good
=
아니 그럼 박봄할때만 음향이 문제였단거야?
=
Stop my tears.....
=
마이크 하자있,,,, 장난까나
=
LETS FO QUEEN! YOU SLAAAAY
=
호흡 왤케 달림?? 들으면서 내가 숨차네;;
=
아 승희 ㅈㄴ 오바떠네
=
The way I interpret the song right now, it seems like Park Bom Unnie is calling the rest of the members. Especially from the beginning of the performance. 
Park Bom doesn't need to win this show ( but it would be still great if she does and I pray for it), cause we all know that she is already a LEGENDARY QUEEN. 
For her, I know she's not there for competition but she just wanted to share her music, talent and most of all she just wanted to enjoy every performance she's doing. Lastly, I know she wanted to be an inspiration to others in not giving up your dreams. As long as you have it in your heart, you can still rise up and achieve it. 
God bless unnie. Hwaiting!!!!
=
명속이지 근데  봄이 ... 나만 달라졌다고 생각행...?
=
ㄹㅇ박봄이 라이브가 약한게 아니라 마이크가 그지같은데..뭘 라이브를 망쳤대 봄언니 진짜 옛날부터 넘 좋아하는 가수였어요 꽃길만 걸으세요🌸🌺🌼
=
박봄이 2:27에 손가락으로 마이크 톡톡 치는게 문제있다는 신호 보낸건 아닐까?
=
나만 눈물난줄 알았는데 사람들 다 그러니까 추억속으로 들어가는것같아서 괜히 마음이 답답하다
=
봄이 언니 보면서 초등학교 중학교 시절 보냈고, 봄이 언니 노래 들으면서 잤었는데 다시 얼굴 비춰주고 노래해줘서 고마워요. 영상 보면서 눈물 났는데 슬픔이 아닌 기쁨의 눈물인 것 같아요. 다른 것보다 언니 건강이 먼저니까, 언니가 항상 행복했으면 좋겠어요. 오랜 팬의 바람이에요 언니 사랑해요.
=
Bom. It's so great to see her performing. Media really tore her down, but she's back and fighting. This song brings so much nostalgia. I love whenever Rosie covers it at concerts; no one can do it like Bom tho.
=
I miss 2nei1
=
I don't know, but this performance gives me hope, a lot of hope for a 2NE1 reunion, PLEASE MNET MAKE IT HAPPEN
=
노래를 들어서 눈물이 날수있는걸 알게해준 가수.. 그냥 듣기전부터 "투애니원이 그리워요" 이때부터 그냥 눈물...
=
C'mon guys road to 4️⃣ millions 🔒➡️🔓we can do it for our QUEEN 👑 🐦 ❤️ #SPRING #PARKBOM #YOUANDI 🇲🇽 ✌🏻
=
2ne1은 레전드야 절대 따라올수없어 어떤 걸그룹도
=
I really love her, Hope to see 4 girls in stage 
Love Park Bom - Love 2NE1
=
i don’t get it....why she got 5th place but is trending on Naver & Melon? are those people who are voting smoke crack?
=
If only 2ne1 did not disband, it would feel so right to watch Queendom with their group in it.
=
1)bad lynph nodes condition
2)Shitty mic
3)gets emotional
And with all of this she slayed and ate the CD like a true👑💅
=
2:27 마이크 이상하다고 툭툭 치는뎅,,,
=
Our Queen come back!! i love how the rookies respect and cheered for her! we all teared up💚
=
PARK BOM IS A QUEEN, ok? ♡ 👑
=
퍼포먼스없이 그저 노래만으로 승부보는거같아서 좋았음
=
투애니원 다모여도 1등못할꺼 같은데;;
=
멜로디랑 가사 근본있는거봐 90년생은 다들 알겠지
=
아니 노래할때 노래만들려주면안되나?왜계속 디른사람말하는거 들려줘서 노래 혼잡하게만들어....;;
=
Road to 1M views. Let’s go Blackjacks! 🙏🏼 Please don’t forget to hit 👍🏼 button.
=
학교축제 마이크같음.. 이게모임..ㅠ
=
I suddenly cried
=
i like her voice,have a magnet magic attract me
=
마이크가 소리를 먹는거 같은데 기분탓인가 했더니 댓글들보니  진짜 마이크 문제 맞나보네
=
이곡 정말 어려운곡입니다.
라이브로 이렇게 매력있게 부르기도 참 어려운걸 박봄은 그 힘든걸 해냅니다. 마이크 끊어짐 현상이 있습니다.
박봄은 제작진에게 2번의 신호를 보냅니다.한번은 인이어에 두번째는 마이크를 두둘깁니다.
그런데 마지막까지 계속 끊김현상있습니다ㅠ
그걸 감안해서 들어주시면 좋겠습니당
박봄 화이팅~!
=
0:52    1:05    2:12   3:56
=
I see baekjin
=
I was a Blackjack, has been since the debut of 2ne1. And when that scandal broke and then the disbandment, I was torn inside and  I just wanted someone to blame and I chose to blame you Park Bom without even trying to believe you. I hated you for years because I was immature and stupid. I know you will never forgive me and I do not want you to but I need to apologize. Sorry for not believing you, sorry for all the hate I had thrown at you, sorry for being stupid and immature as these are not an excuse to trash and hate someone. I believe that we have not yet seen the last of 2ne1, CL has now left YG and i think Dara will follow suit soon. I hope when that time comes, you'll be whole once again on the stage. Blackjacks will wait.
=
my QUEEN :'(  no ı'm not cryıng you are !!!
=
음향 상태까지 완벽했다면 지금 느낀 소름에 배는 더 느꼈을꺼야
=
박봄님은 눈화장이 참 인형같으시네
=
What if next reality show by m-net is Monster Rookie Dom (MRD)? 

Group is:
1. BlackPink
2. Twice 
3. Red Velvet
4. ITZY
5. (G) - idle
6. IZ*ONE

It would be awesome cz they have 2 groups from the same company.
=
마이크 상태 왜 저러냐 마이크 잣같은거도 갖다줬네
=
Tem como não chorar ao ver a Bom sozinha no palco, impossível se segurar. Chorei o vídeo todo e ainda estou a derramar lagrimas. T.T, 2NE1 nunca morreu e nunca morrerá, não importa oque digam, sou Black Jack para sempre.
=
T.T you don't find that kind of voice often. It's beautifully rare
=
WOW
=
이거 생방도 아니잖아? 마이크 문제에도 불구하고 어쩌고 존잘 그런 연출이냐? 암넷은 답이 없다
=
