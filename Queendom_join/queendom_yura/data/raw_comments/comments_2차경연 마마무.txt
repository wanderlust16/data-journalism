When solar slipped even her sound of being terrified is a melody
=
Seriously the best vocal group out there.   Was shocked to read Solar was turned down by 40 companies.  You gotta keep believing for the right team at the right time
=
Solar is profesional the way she handled herself when she made a slight mistake was great
=
I'm just saying this performance is concert worthy but Mamamoo gave it to y'all for free in this competition. Seriously this is some MTV awards worthy performance or something.
=
can we also appreciate moonbyul's brilliance of writing a new verse? 

everyone's flags were in their respective 4 season colors too!!
=
Solar: “I’m im the top”
Moonbyul: *say no more-*
=
Jimin was shook when Solar started singing Puss, and so was I
=
their stage presence is just out of this universe
=
Haters: “MAMAMOO did a horrible cover of AOA God Luck”

AOA: 😻😻😻😻😻🥰😻🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🙏🏽🥰🌙🥰🙏🏽🥰💖🥰💖🥰💖 “dying in fangirls mod”
=
화사 진짜 무대천재다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 어떻게 노래를 저리 쫄깃하게 부를까
=
I just noticed whenever the cam goes to Bom, she was staring at the group, all of the group to be exact, which u can sense sadness. How she miss her group


Bom: we used to be like them. We used to be the ones who rule this Kpop world. We used to be the queens, now we rule our own kingdom. It is still better when we are together
=
그냥 솔라가 랩하는 부분이 라이브 인정한듯 ㄷ ㄷ
=
The only reason mamamoo hasn't done this kind of concept more often is because they don't want everyone to die prematurely
=
이 무대는 화사 도입부가 진짜 레전드였음 아직도 잊혀지지가 않아서 보러와요...
=
Girls be gay and dropping panties after watching mamamoo
=
솔라 지르는거 들으니까 마마무가 식스센스 불렀으면 어땠을까 상상하게 됨...
=
Is everyone ok? My cause of death was moonbyul. Let's all enjoy the afterlife together
=
Wheein getting more sexy and hot wow
=
Solar: girls girls on top
Eric Nam: has entered the chat
=
Look, I'm not saying moonsun could get married here based on their outfits...but I wouldn't be surprised if it suddenly turned into a wedding
=
Can we just appreciate wheein's outfit? She ROCKS
=
i watched this for about more than 100 times but i didn’t know that solar tripped at 3:39 like... PROFESSIONAL!!!!
=
마마무가 진짜 대단한게
퀸덤 공연 하기 바로 전날에 이틀연속 콘서트 하고 왔는데, 상위권 유지하고
휘인은 아파서 방송도 참여 못하는 상황에서
메인 무대 리허설에서 20분 준비하고 무대 올라갔는데
저 손가락 제스처를 만들어 냄
진짜 k팝의 미래 들
=
이게 묻혔단 게 진짜 ㅋㅋ... 아 진짜 탄식만 나온다 편집은 개같고 곡 자체를 본인들 만의 스타일로 소화하고 노래를 아예 다르게 한다는 게 얼마나 대단한 건데 의상, 무대 구성? ㅋㅋ 그걸 문제 삼아서 과소평가 된 게 빡쳐...
=
솔라가 언프리티랩스타 지민 벌스를 부를줄은 꿈에도 몰랐네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
그냥 마마무가 마마무했다!!!
=
*WHO IS DOING IT LIKE MAMAMOO?* NOBODY. I ONLY SEE GODDESSES
=
댄서들과 빨간두건 하나 차이일뿐인데 ㄹㅇ 화사 압도적이다.. 코빅에 빨간장갑이있다면 퀸덤엔 빨간두건이있다
=
무대가 요란하다는 소리많던데, 개인적으로 난 여러 장르의 단편 소설들을 묶은 한 권의 책같았음.. 저걸 현실에서 봤더라면  감탄만 하느라 바빴을거같어
=
왁 근데 진짜 이거 들으니까 원곡이 생각이 안나,,,,, 진짜 가창력 독보적....
=
can we appreciate how professional Solar is even if she slipped.
=
MAMAMOO IS ONE OF THE MOST ALL ROUNDER KPOP GROUPS OUT THERE THAT'S ACTUALLY STABLE AND GOOD. THAT'S A FACT AND YOU CAN'T DISAGREE
=
This is why everyone should be stanning Mamamoo.
=
Bruh all I gotta say is 








YASSSSSS QUEENS 👸🏾
=
엌ㅋㅋ 그말이 맞네 너희들이 뭘 좋아할지 몰라서 다 준비했어~~~~!!!!
=
I don't even care who wins the damn thing. Seeing all of them cover each other's songs is enough for me to die in happiness.
=
김용선 확 지르고 나서 뿌듯한 표정으로 애드립 넣는 건 항상 짜릿해,,, 정휘인 맨날 티도 안 내고 아무렇지도 않게 애드립 까는 것도 짜릿해,,, 정휘인 애드립에 제발 집중해서 함 들어보세요 신세계 ^^ !
=
4:59 박봄 표정이 너무..... ㅠㅠ 예전에 한창 무대 날아다녔던 시절 그리워하는 거 같음 ㅠㅠ
=
실력이남아도네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ러블리즈 반만줘라
=
문별이 랩을 잘하는건 알았지만 진짜 랩 너무 좋다....
=
한국판 리틀믹스 같다 뭔가 여팬이 많은이유를 알겠네
=
이거 보고 문별한테 제대로 치였다 하아아 진짜 언니 사랑해요
=
화사 음색 진짜 매력있다. 무대 위에서 제스쳐랑 에튀튜드 그냥 싹 다 존나 멋있어
=
AT 3:04 I SCRIMMED WHEEIN YOU DIDN’T HAVE TO ATTacK LIKE THAT
=
Mamamoo literally is the only group out there being criticised for showcasing too much talent in a single performance.😂👑🔥  #RaiseYourStandards 🤷
=
LITERALLY MAMAMOO JUST GAVE THE REAL PURPOSE OF QUEENDOM.
=
no one does it like mamamoo. they deadass made a whole new concept out of aoa's good luck. queens stop slaying me like this pls
=
이게 퍼포먼스 없이 그냥 귀로만 감상하는 음원이었으면 통일성 없어서 별로였겠지만 이건 눈 귀로 감상하는 무대라서 진짜 그 시너지가 대박인 거 같음... 진짜 너무 좋다 4-5분 내로 각자의 특색을 살려서 한 노래로 4개의 무대를 구성한 거 잖아 진짜 소름돋게 좋다 대박이다
=
All I wanna to say is

They are literally a *QUEEN*
=
dont let loco see this masterpiece!!! he might marry hwasa after watching
=
다른 애들은 커버를햇고 
마마무는 콘서트를 했다.
=
4:28 is my favorite part because of their expressions. This is the reason why I dig Mamamoo's live performance. They totally enjoyed it and it makes me, as viewers, happy :D
=
wheein is my literal aesthetic she literally is goals✨🤧💕
=
아이돌중에 무대를 제일 잘 씹어먹는게 cl이라고 생각했는데 화사도 욕나올 정도로 쌈싸먹네.다른멤버들도 잘하지만 워낙에 특출나다보니 둘이 같이 공연하는것도 재미있을거같다
=
Bitch this is not just a performance, this a whole level concert
=
that was so disrespectful. Hwasa with her hips hitting the floor, Moonbyul with her handsomeness, Solar with her legs, Wheein and her little red dress. Gave me a heart attack out here 😩
=
When someone says nothing is perfect
Me: *shows em this vid*
=
I really liked the genre they went for for Hwasa’s part. The overall performance tho was really great. All of them did so well. Moonbyul shook me when she came in w her own rap it kinda murdered me ngl
=
솔라 문별 휘인 화사 누구 한명 말할 거 없이 다 너무너무 잘했다ㅜㅜㅜ 개인적으로 퀸덤 방송 다 통틀어서 레전드 탑 3 안에 든다고 생각함
=
This is why more than 90% mamamoo fans is girl..i mean non-straight girls
=
어떤얘들은 무대 너무 요란하고 어수선하다는 얘들 있던데 이건 어수선한게 아니라 걍 자유롭게 즐기는거 아닌가ㅋㅋㅋ
난 이렇게 무대에서 그냥 무대하는게 아니라 제대로 놀고 즐겨서 좋은데
=
I like died a hundred times bc of this. TALENTED WOMEN
=
MAMAMOO IS YHAT QUALITY GIRL GROUP THAT NEED MORE ATTENTION AND WE ALL SHOULD APPRECIATE THEIR TALENT
=
다른 영상에 bang bang처럼 솔로가수 4명이 콘서트 합동공연하는 것 같다고 썼음. 근데 이 영상으로 관객반응까지 같이 보니까 완전 그래미같은 시상식무대 같다.
=
This is how many INTERNATIONAL fans mamamoo have🇹🇷


⬇️
=
Who am i kidding ofcourse imma hit that replay button damn
=
Wheein kinda murdered me

I lied they all killed me I was just tryna blame one person for my death
=
이거보고 원곡생각 ㄹㅇ 1도 안듬. 왜 마마무인지 알수있는 무대
=
솔라 랩할때 언프리티 랩스타 패러디한거 생각난다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
기억하는사람 있나?
=
Hwasa was born to be on the stage. the power she has, the aura she exudes, the emotions she express. Her stage presence is unbelievable.
=
뮤지컬 보는 느낌이다 개쩐다 멤버 하나하나 개성과 특색 잘 하는 장르가 다르니까 이렇게 하나하나 다른 무대가 나오는구나 진짜 개쩐다 와 개좋음
=
The girl’s reaction just exactly like when I heard Moon rap😂😂😂
=
Oh my gosh wheein's new hairstyle is going to kill mehhhhhhhh
=
헐 이거 마마무 노랜줄... 소화력 무엇...
=
Hwasa is INCREDIBLE. Her stage presence is completely UNTOUCHABLE.
=
this really feels like a concert, how they can make the audience to follow them. the power
=
The amount of screams for byul tho.... HARD SAME
=
True Confidence Here. 
*Who else bow with me?*
=
이건 멤버들도 잘했지만 카메라 워킹이 진짜 기가 막히네... 특히 엔딩.. 빠르게 줌아웃하는거 지림
=
FIERCE HWASA
BADASS MOONBYUL
GORGEOUS SOLAR
SEXY WHEEIN
TALENTED MAMAMOO 🔥🔥
=
Honestly, every time I watch this
I never notice Solar trip
She makes it unnoticeable
Also at 4:09 she looks so offended that the lyrics was taken
=
1:52 나는 솔라언나 부분이 그렇게 젛다 이말이야
=
THEY'RE QUEENS I'M NOT EVEN COMPLAINING. PERIOF
=
" Who is the next?" I'M DEAD
=
They just represented 4 types of different girl power from this performance: 
Hwasa - bad bitch
Moonbyul - tomboyish
Solar - sultry diva
Wheein - sexy
=
솔라 파트가 넘 맴돈다 와
=
뭔가 다 다른 개성 가진 뮤지션들 모아두고 노래 한번불러달라고 해서 불러주는거같다 근데 호흡척척맞고  마마무 사랑해 엉엉 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
19연말 시상식을 여기서 해버렸네 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
THEY'RE HAVING A COMEBACK SOON, SUPPORT THE QUEENS!
=
So all of Mamamoo literally just said that they're tops. cool. imma just die then
=
I REMEMBER IMPRETTY RAPSTAR BC OF THAT PUSS XD
=
whenever I watch MAMAMOO’s performance, it is like they can share power

I feel like I CAN DO EVERYTHING
=
4:38 난 여기가 다같이 부르는 부분이 넘 조아ㅠㅠ 휘인이 다른멤버 쳐다보면서 부르는것도 최고임..ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm sorry but I can't find any girl group in this generation that can top mamamoo's stage presence
=
Am I the only one laughing while Wheein SPRINTS over to the main stage lollll
=
Mamamoo is always consistently on top, but can we get a round with just vocals (acapella or acoustic songs) and watch them (& Park Bom) annihilate everyone?
=
I swear wheein is a goddess
=
Solar: Girls girls on top
Also Solar: **BOOP**
=
Mnet Queendom : you can doing lipsync if you want

Mamamoo : are you drunk?
=
Honestly speaking, if the people voting aint trainees or fans, mamamoo would win with their stage presence for this round.
=
솔라 안 다쳐서 다행이다  ㅜ ㅠ조심
=
화사는 보면 볼수록 왜 인기많은지 납득이 감 솔직히 처음엔 나도 왜캐 혼자 인기많나 했거든
=
This group called Mamamoo is sooooooooooo good omg
=
I feel I'm watching a medley stage of 4 new songs 👀
MAMAMOO's concert is worth everyone attending 👏
=
"It's like a concert"
I TOTALLY AGREE
Moomoo for life 
Proud of my girls
=
Anti's said that they lipsync lol hwasa should've not sang the lyrics wrong, if it's recorded. Gosh, just accept that they are queens.
=
I’ve been watching this over and over again for months. Their performance is really captivating 😳
=
If you think that this is a mess, pls watch the performance without the reactions. 
The constant interruptions mnet did (around a min Only for mamamoo - for the rest it was shorter) are making it sound like a mess.
I swear it's not! Just hear the full audio.
=
뭐야 언니들 커버를 하라니까 콘서트를 하시면 어떡해요
=
휘인 너무 조아...ㅠ0ㅠ 춤선 최고예뻥ㅠ
=
I heard this when i played spotify and i was like, wait a minute i'm playing mamamoo's song right ? But why AOA song played. Then i check in youtube and seeing this and OMG it's mind blowing it's like masterpiece, i mean it's great, such a best perform from Mamamoo 😍😍

I luv it 💕💕
=
Mamamoo the best performances in queendom
=
지호 부끄러워 하는거 왤케 귀엽지ㅜㅜㅜ
2:10
=
Really felt like it was a stage from their concert 😍😍😍 if you didn’t tell me it was a cover song
=
마마무는 진짜 안좋ㄴ아할수가 없구나 느끼게 되는 무대
=
Can we just take time to appreciate hwasa's floor twerk like it's the most perfect thing I've seen this week
=
역시는 역시다 진짜루ㅜㅜ
=
마마무본다고 퀸덤 봤는데! 다른 분들에게도 빠지게되고~  마마무에는 더빠지게 되어버리는 순간!
=
Mamamoo is not a girl group. Not woman group nor Queen group. They have transcended the heavens and become the *GODDESS* group.
=
To the girl in 1:21
Yes i feel the same
=
헐...나 이거 마마무 노래인줄 알고 웬 커버곡이지? 했는데  aoa노래였네...와..
=
Watch 1:51 and 4:10 , mnet is a snake, this is why I prefer watch the performance without the reactions
=
The facr Jimin made when Solar sing Puss it's so funny "good she's good "
=
무료로 보면 안 될 것 같은 무대...
=
My god, why can’t America have queens like these 4 😍😍 would sell my kidneys to see them live.
=
notice how jimin’s(AoA) reaction to the end of MoonByul’s verse and her reaction to Solar singling her song is the same

(queendom pulled a fast one)
=
화사 진짜 잘한다
=
If you still dont stan mamamoo at this point, you need to reevaluate your standards when it comes to super women group
=
I got Goosebumps  hear the high notes of solar
=
Im rooting for them to win it all!!! No one can do live performances back to back to back lik them with RAW vocals!!!!
=
Remember when stans from other groups said this iconic and original performance was a mess? Mamamoo got a FULL SCORE from the audience. We had to laugh. Mookarma is real ladies😉
=
Back to Queendom stage looks so much better than MAMA 2019 so far 😁
=
wheein is hot and no one can fight me on this 

Lotta love for mamamoo 💗💗💗💗💗💗
=
omg wheein was so beautiful and her voice too 😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥
=
My heart broke every time they showed Park Bom because you can see in her expressions how much she misses being on a group in this case 2NE1 😔...
=
역시 솔라님..ㅠㅠ 실수를 해도 아무렇지 않은척 넘어가기!!!♥ 멋있게 마무리♥
=
This is literally biggest hit towards anyone who has said that Mamamoo cannot perform well whilst dancing and that they're only stable because they don't do much dancing. Like this performance is both a win for the straights and gays. What can Mamamoo not do? And that Unpretty Rapstar reference, damn Solar.
=
4:29
Hwasa singing that bridge sounded amazing
=
why is Jimin's Reaction same with 1:50 and 4:09 Mnet's editing again?
=
Me gusta más esta versión que la original :v
Like si a ti también;-;
=
4:39 the mean of power 😍😭👑
=
Love how each part showed their style and who they were
=
So this is what gogobebe did to them btw their stage presence was so good I’m jungshook
=
Im official BISEXUAL and mamamoo shape me into something real
=
I honestly don't know how many times I've watched this perf. So awesome. Byul killed me and my ovaries
=
이렇게 잘했는데 
잡을게없어서 의상논란일으킨거 개웃김 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
몰라 맘무 언니 처음부터 끝까지 존나잘했어 ㅠ
나에겐 언니들밖에없어 언니들 내 모든걸 가져가 ㅠ
=
And i think this is why the lesbian rate is going up
=
걸그룹 4인조 그룹에서 주기적으로 독보적 그룹이 나오는것 같지 않나요?

1998년 ~ 핑클 + 이효리
2005년 ~ 브아걸 + 가인
2010년 ~ 2ne1 + CL
2016년 ~ 마마무 + 화사

진짜 신기한거 같음

이 뒤를 이을 또다른 독보적 4인조 그룹은 어떤 그룹이 될지 궁금함
=
Jimin’s reaction when Solar started rapping with the lyrics from “Puss” lmao
=
I love every Jimin's reaction for this performance lol
=
What an outstanding performance. That was indeed a mini concert.
=
HWASA IS SUCH A QUEEN I LOVE HER CONFIDENCE HER STAGE PRESENCE. CAN’T TAKE MY EYES OFF HER EVERY MOMENT.
=
Why so handsome my Byulie.❤
=
mamamoo : *you're welcome*
=
Solar: ...chill
Me: I can't 😆
=
화사 컨셉으로 전부 다했어도 좋았을듯!
=
technically there is 5 different genres performed: 
hwasa - reggae
moonbyul - hiphop
solar - big band/jazz
wheein - r&b/pop 
finally when they perform as OT4, it's rock. 
(that baseline during the bridge though) 

so proud of these ladies. 
MAMAMOO HWAITING
=
文总好帅！！！！！发出我可以的声音
=
As an AoA Elvis I have to say this performance was really great. Mamamoo did an excellent job with this song. Is it just me or does Hwasa resemble the Gerudo girls in the Zelda games.
=
이렇게 러블리즈 잠깐씩 나올때 제복입고있길래 오마이걸 노래중에 제복입는 노래가 있었나 생각했는데 오마이걸노래가 아니라 식스센스였을줄이야
=
This is my first time seeing mamamoo... Imagine the shock I got from watching these ladies perform and kill it on stage o_O
=
This is not a competition, this is MAMAMOO's concert
=
"Mother father top madam"😂😂
=
They don't have one specific concept. Each one give to the group their other own concept and create something amazing named MAMAMOO
=
3:18 와 커튼 팍! 하고 나오는데 간지가 와....... 내마음도 퍽!
=
4:07
When someone brings up an embarrassing situation of yours at an important party.
P.S.: Jimin's face
=
Hwasa was born to be a star. Her stage presence and confidence always impresses me.
=
Wheein is so gorgeous in this hairstyle, i can't!!!
=
박봄 반응이 제일 웃겨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ...
=
Look at their confidence and sucess makes me feel so good since i am just a potato
=
OMG WHEEIN...
=
노래 개 세련된거바.. 미쳐따,, 지민 puss랩도 거따가 끼워넣는 센스까지 ㄷㄷ 지민이 놀랬을듯
=
Did anyone realise that the clip of Jimin at 1:51 is the same as 4:10 LOL nice mnet
=
I'm not joking when I say whenever I watch this performance I choked a lot. It's hard to breathe like ffff.
=
2:09 somewhere in the world Hyuna is very proud
=
Why they edited jimins shocking face reaction from moonbyul on solars rap verse???
=
Hwasa is sexy you know we know she knows Jimin knows, Loco knows, Baehyun knows and Taehyung knows...
=
People and the other idols were screaming hard while Mamamoo was performing this song. Every idol was scared and accepted the fact that they can't beat Mamamoo. Lemme tell ya, "This wasn't even Mamamoo's best performance, you'd have dies on the spot if u saw the best."

Edit- No hate intended to the others, take this as a joke plz.
=
THE FREAKING CHARISMA YOU ALL....
=
This just made me love them
=
*who else almost died watching them do this?* 
mamamoo is 100000/10 in talent— please Stan :< 🖤
=
Who says mamamoo have it easy cause they don't dance? They can do it all, find another excuse for your faves
=
Seriously this feels like watching a concert
=
BOM is missing her members 😭
=
Everyone's talented and amazing in their own performances! I can't decide who's the best, but I love them all BOM, G-IDLE, Mamamoo, AOA
=
THIS COVER ITS SO AMAZING
=
Lol they are so bad at lipsync that they sing live instead
=
I CANT GET THIS OUT OF MY HEAD HELP
=
this is my i can't count watch 😂
=
4:47 

Don’t flip flop mind me
=
Let's clap our hands for wheein too :))
=
Mnet: you don't have to sing live

Mamamoo: hold my mic and apologize to it
=
Wheein, Solar, Moonbyul, and Hwasa tho 😍😍😍
=
Mamamoo is one of the most complete groups this world has ever seen
=
4:26 "its like a concert" yes girl. we feel you.
=
I watch this on a daily basis.
=
When solar almost slipped but still sang better than almost all singers ahahaha 3:31
=
솔라 랩하는거 지민이가 언프리티랩스타때 했던랩인가..?
=
Wheein’s so COOL😎
=
The energy!! The renditions!! The added verses!! 🔥
=
Moonbyul’s fan girls when she came out 😂😂❤️
=
They just put like 5 genres/concepts into one song...wow queens
=
Idk why this performance getting hate?when i first watched the episode this was literally the performance that gave me goosebumps
=
watching this makes you STAN MAMAMOO more😍😍😍
=
They killed it!! The best vocal group EVER!! This is why you mustn’t sleep on Mamamoo!!! Sleep on your pillows instead!!
=
Okay, now this is a performance! It’s called QUEENDOM for a reason! 🔥
=
I’m waiting for their comeback and their legengary performance at MAMA . Who’s with me ?
=
엉엉ㅜㅜ 너무 멋지다 진짜ㅠㅠㅠ 우리 비교는 하지말고 그냥 멋진걸 즐기자고요ㅠ.. 뭣하러 비교해서 서로 기분 상합니까ㅠㅠ 멋진걸 즐기기에도 부족한데ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 맘무 사랑해요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
The performance full of surprise! 😂
=
This deserves the first place
=
To those so called "dancers who can also sing" who are coming after mamamoo saying their dance is easy Please post of video of yourself Dancing and SINGING IN THE SAME LEVEL AS THEY DID.

P.s. Tbh I am a dancer who can also sing too.In my opinion the dance here is an average dance routine for kpop girls group and it's definitely not an easy dance routine.Plus most of kpop girl group who also have average dance routine like this one haven't gave us the same POWERFUL AND STABLE VOCALS LIKE MAMAMOO SO STOP complaining AND ENJOY THE MINI CONCERT THEY JUST GAVE YOU ALL FOR FREEE.
=
Please they just group of playful kids when choosing the song but this is the result. It's illegal im calling the police!
=
People who throw hates on this performance simply because they don’t want to admit that our Queens SLAYED ‘EM THIS HARD 🤭
=
The way Solar just kept on singing and dancing like nothing happened after she almost feel shows how professional she is
=
난 진짜 다 좋은데 휘인 파트가 왜이리 좋냐ㅠㅠ 목소리가 좋아서인지 모르겠지만 너무 깔끔하게 불러서 듣기에 좋음
=
THEY CAME
THEY SAW
THEY CONQUERED
=
Hwasa: sassy, swag
Moonbyul: boyish swag making everyone gay
Solar: flirty, burlesque
Wheein: chic, dancing queen
WE LOVE OUR 4 QUEENS!!
Edit: thank you guys for the likes 😭❤️
Edit n.2: 1k likes? 😱😱😱😱❤️
=
Wheein so pretty
=
best girl group in kpop industry.
sorry not sorry. they got number one for me:') so talented. like little mix..
=
Wheein looks so good OMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!
=
화사가 춤을 ㅈㄴ잘춘다 진짜 몸이 가벼워 대박임 걍
=
Its a good decision that Hwasa is the first performer. So fierce!
=
Mamamoo really owned this stage
=
뫄........
진짜 나 이 노래 좋다고 한번도 느낀적
없었는데
그냥 이노래 마마무 줘라...
와 말도안된다
그냥 원곡이랑 다른곡이고
그냥 마마무 노래네...
=
I know this sounds weird but, at the end I love how hwasa and the backup dancers were actually twerking and not back popping
=
Haters: they lipsyncing 


Mamamoo: what’s that 🤨
=
*Who told them to prepare for a concert?? They're supposed to cover a song. THEIR PERFORMANCE AND STAGE PRESENCE IS EVERYTHING!!!*
=
3:40 나는 프로다 나는 프로다 나는 프로다 나는 프로다 나는 프로다
=
YAZZZZ! 🔥🔥🔥 The stage is burning
=
WHEEIN ON A PIANOOOOO
=
0:12 oh no Jimim doesn't look like that. What have you done to Jimin. 😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
4 singers, 4 rappers, 4 dancers, 4 individuals, together they are MAMAMOO!!! So proud of them! 🔥
=
Moonbyul is my bias but WHEEIN is so freakin gorgeous with that red outfit 😍
=
4:08 jimin 😂
=
Woooow they’re so good I’m in love with them ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
OMG HOW CAN SOMEBODY DEVOUR THE STAGE LIKE THIS
=
I really don’t want to be overly dramatic but Mamamoo is the personification of perfection.
=
Park bom reaction 4:58 😂
=
와 휘인진짜 너무 예뻐서 말이 안나온다
=
1:51 and 4:10 are literally the same frame.
=
Wheein looks so good in here! So pretty! 😍
=
President of S. Korea: When do you want to meet
Hwasa: Yes
=
문별언니 너무 멋있어ㅠ 같은 여자가 봐도 반했다ㅠㅠ 솔라 언니도 휘인 언니도 화사언니도 짱짱
=
The besssst after Park Bom in Queendom 😂😍😍😘
=
I wish I was blessed enough to see that live.
=
Lmao, hwasa was singing the chorus like Girigiri I like me..... I always sing it wrong too, lmao, im not the only one
=
What the?? This level of performance is like an award show. They really are not playing..
=
this group is on another level👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
=
우와 팝송같아,,,❤️
=
I'm literally screeching right now
=
I watch almost every hour and i never bored. But because that i almost forget the original song🤣🤣🤣🤣
=
I want hwasa's version to cover the full song 😵
=
I knew I could trust Wheein
=
wheein step on me PERIODT
=
I just thought that what if mamamoo covered 2ne1 song? That's gonna be cool moonbyul being CL omooo~
=
After a long time I am seeing some strong vocals and damn that concept . It reminds me of the  hardcore concepts and songs of 2ne1 . This group definitely made bom feel !
=
설현이 화사 좋아하는 거 가태ㅋㅋ
=
4:39 I love this part. When the four of them sing
=
bom's look after solar's high note: rip my career
=
What happened to Solar shows that Mamamoo is not doing lip-synch in any performances. The Queens.❤️
=
I can’t breathe ma Queen
=
Hwasa's stage presence is on another level. She has that Queen aura.
=
Solar rapping is another level..!!
=
Are we gonna ignore the fact that Hwasa just gave the floor some love (if you know what I mean 😏)
=
Hwasa ❤️
=
Solar rap Puss is the best 😂
=
Theyre trully LEGENDS ! MAMAMOO
=
They slay as always~~
=
4:59
Parkbom: i Miss my group.. 😔😌
=
I've watched this for an unhealthy amount... :')
=
so, queendom is actually just a platform for mamamoo's flexing...
honestly as much as I am a loyal miracle and lovelinus, mamamoo clearly and fairly deserves to win this show, right from the start. no one is at their level of performance.
=
Oh! Solar so beautiful. I like her shape so much.Its inspire for me.I want body like herrrr😂💕❤❤❤
=
@4:54 my reaction this whole video lol
=
Wheein.... You stole my heart💞
=
5:00 you can clearly see that bom is missing 2ne1 days when they were performing together
=
Hwasa's stage presence is really out of this world. She is so amazing.
=
They make every second count. AWESOME 😍😍😍
=
1:21.. hunny, I feel you.
=
Mamamoo queendom marathon because comeback is near 🔥🔥❤️❤️
=
The high notes gave me goosebumps
=
First time in recorded history a group on television steals another groups song and makes it their own with little resistance
=
4:17 왜 다들 이분 표정은 안말하짘ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 너무 적절해서 웃겨 미칠거같은데ㅠㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
1:21 *Literally me having a heart attack*
=
Mamamoo makes me wanna buy harness
=
you know you're on top when Bom starts looking nervous
=
KIM YONG SUN!
MOON BYULYI!
JUNG WHEE IN!
ANH HYEJIN!
MAMAMOO!!!!!
=
진짜 화사 누나 미쳣다 진짜 어케 저렇게 노래를 진짜 잘부르지? 진짜 쫄깃하다라는 말이딱인것 같다.
매력에 빠져든다..
=
STRAIGHT UP SLAPS ‼️‼️
=
byul still catches me off guard here,, like look at her suddenly appearing like THAT mom im gay
=
Moonbyul​ Oppa💕
=
I bet they all were born on stage, let's ask their moms 😂
=
I want a suga and moonybul collab 🥺😍🔥
=
Mamamoo are so powerful QUEENS
=
I’m drooling tbh 🤤😵 MY QUEENS!!!!!
=
Need video for this songs, MAMAMOOOOOOOO LEGENDS
=
*MAMAMOO IS DEFINITELY IS ALREADY ON ANOTHER LEVEL OF KPOP THAT YOU WILL NEVER EVER WILL FOUND THE SAME ONE LIKE THIS*
=
Wow they went all out it really feels like concert!!!!
=
1:01, yo solo vi como la chica de la derecha quería opacar a GodHwasa💖
=
wow mamamoo got some serious swag damn..
=
There’s no song that they can’t sing! They own the stage! ❤️
=
Hwasa slayed.
Solar slayed.
Wheein slayed.
Moonbyul slayed.
We Moomoos found slayed.
=
WOW AMAZING <3
=
1:48 붓은 문별이 잡는다는 가사 너무 좋다.... 아 문별 너무 멋있어ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
3:27 3:43 3:50 5:27 사랑해.....
=
Their voices really blended well my gosh this is so amazing group
=
와 언니들 퀸덤에서 콘서트를 하면 어떡합니까 ㅠㅜㅠㅠ 너무 좋잖아요 ,,, 원곡이 하나도 생각 안나고 진짜 마마무색으로 편곡했네 좋다 ❤️♥️❤️♥️ 우리 무무들은 누구네처럼 자기아이돌은 잘했고 원곡보다 이게 훨씬 낫다 원곡 구리다 이런말하는 무개념팬들없을거라고 믿어요 💗
=
*They sing this song like their own* *QUEENS*
=
OMG the song already my favorite... n when this come... OMG!!! OMG!!! OMG!!! Im so hyper!!!... urghhhh i need to calmed down... fuh~~ fuh~~~~ my love part is ALL!!!
=
그냥 진짜 마마무가 마마무했다
=
용선이 저 귀엽고 톡톡쏘는 랩 좋아ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Damn moonbyul's growls always get meee
=
I love how even when solar slipped, she still keep her expression normal and professional. That's what i call a true talented artist
=
*her reaction is my reaction* 1:21
=
She's right this is like their CONCERT!! 💖💖😍😍
=
What I just saw are four ladies with souls that are independent, strong and sparkling. What is more, they are a team. Just superb.
=
So amazing perfomance stage
Mamamoo fighting
=
아니 화사 무슨 어디 대한미국 뉴욕시에서 왔냐??? 왤케 힙해 마쳤어 누나 아니 시스터;;
=
I love it stage so very perfect
=
Hwein and moonbyul so beautiful in here
=
4:41 I'm gay for Wheein
=
My ears so blessing
=
그냥 마마무는 1등하려고 나온게 아니라 그냥 콘서트 하러 왔네
=
Can we talk about 4.57 Minnie said “Wow” in very Thai accent 😂😂😂?
=
Me: *watched this the minute it was uploaded about 5362727 times*

YouTube recommendation: *constantly recommend me this ever since*

I'm not complaining though.
=
i truly love their dancers👏🏽
=
2.09 my fav <3
=
that little slip up and recovery shows off mamamoo's professionalism AND the fact that they're singing 100% live


edit: ok!! what i meant was that they're giving their 100% !!! i can hear the backing track stop coming for me and stream this thanks
=
Tbh I was so enchanted by them that i only noticed that Solar made a mistake by reading a comment otherwise that would've gone completly over my head 🤣🤣🤷🏾‍♀️
=
Hwasa collab with Woggie will drop on 10/11 friday 6PM KST 가을속에서
=
This is everything 🔥
=
Look at the girls' reaction when Byul appears . 😅
=
Mamamoo are QUEENS, but its absolutely embarrassing as a moomoo to see some fellow "fans" of Mamamoo drag other groups in the comments.
Have you learned nothing from watching our girls? They're literally some of the most humble people in the industry. Stop being a 🤡 and shitting on other groups to raise our own.
*THANKS* 

*Edit:* Guys, before you reply with "I don't see any comments like that". Top comments on videos get switched around. There was a specific one with 327 likes that was the main reason for me posting this. If there is no toxic shit in the comments like that right now then that's great. Just clarifying why I said this in the first place.. We can hype our queens without putting down others in the process.
=
MOONBYUL AND HER GENTLEMEN <3
=
The reaction at 1:51 tho
=
so much talent. these girls are true performers!!! LOVE mamamoo!!!
=
계속 머리에 맴돌아. 아 진짜 무대 장인들ㅠ
=
마마무 : 너희들이 무슨 장르를 좋아할지 몰라서 일단 다 준비했어
=
woAH HIP mv played before this
=
this song is stuck in my head bcz of mamamoo cover lol
=
Apparently JIMIN said she wanted to get closer to SOLAR. 
For now they had successfully exchange phone numbers,
Next, we wait for puss vol2.
=
Didn't expect this sexy concept from Wheein. ❤
=
We need more Mamamoo performing songs from other group (but they may make all look like theirs though)
=
wheein is so BEAUTYFULLLLL!!!!
=
that girls girls on top. . my eyes almost popped out 😂byulie is blessed. . nvr let go of solar. . #moonsun
=
thankyou mamamoo, im blessed :')
=
4:41휘인 너무 예쁘다ㅠㅠ
=
MAMAMOO DID IT YA'LL
=
Amazing performance n amazing voice
=
문별은  진짜 멋있는 표정이 너무 멋짐ㄷㄷ
=
These girls are sick!!! Omg!!! 😍😍😍
=
2:11  지홐ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
진짜 마마무는 마마무다... ㄷㄷ
=
4:09 Jimin looks betrayed hahaha
=
I forgot how to breathe
=
솔라 넘어질뻔했는데도 당황하지않고 바로 표정짓는 클라스...
=
Omo Jimin's analytical reaction on their raps, we stan an observant queen
=
3:27 yOOO I FEEL SO ATTACKED?!?
=
Must say... Solars back up dancers body made me feel self conscious of my own.
=
Moonbyul pls girl kill me with your devastating wink attack
=
I'm laughing too hard at that girl having a gay panic for Moonbyul when she came
=
이번 퀸덤으로 인해 화사가 다시보인다 ㅠㅠ진짜 너무멋지다 스타일도 힙하고 음색진짜 개미친 ㅜ
=
❤️love ma ma m o o
=
I. AM. STRAI—wait, am I?
=
I just want to be the piano
=
문별 모자 뒤로쓰니까 진짜 시우민이 랩하는거같네..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
seriously jinnja, mamamoo should got more recognize. they are so talented:') dont sleep over their talent please
=
Mamamoo indeed! 👏
=
Just like their concert. OMG !!!
=
Lots of kinds of music in this video OMG
=
I don't know what this show is, but they need to win it
=
솔라 섹시하게 등장해선 묵직한 저음으로 시작하는거 개쎄게 치인다...
=
휘인 목소리가 너무 좋음..ㅠㅠ
=
휘인언니ㅣ이이ㅜ이이이이이ㅣ이유ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜ언니ㅣㅠㅜㅠㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜ
=
2:18 개좋다 머리 찰랑
=
Seriously, if they don’t win this, I will flip tables.
=
4:07 솔라가 지민랩할때 aoa멤버들이 다같이 지민 쳐다보는거 귀여워..ㅋㅋㅋ
=
And I'm supposed to believe Hwasa is the maknae
=
Mamamoo is sooooo WONDERFUL 👑❤
=
Tbh, i dont really like this performance at start. But from the second reff and on its really good
=
4명 각각 개성이 확실하고 본인들이 추구하고자하는게 확실한데 그렇다고 각각 따로노는게 아니라 잘 어울러지는게 마마무의 큰 매력이라고 생각함
한 무대인데 5개 무대 보는거 같았다 오늘 진짜 찢었다 마마무가 마마무했다는 말이 괜히 있는게 아님
=
im a proud fans ♥
=
I actually like solar concept more
=
solar just prove us its not lips sync. 🙌
=
Gosh. This is not simply a cover.... this is a CONCERT! As expected of MMM!!! FIGHTING! ❤
=
I couldn’t even count how many times I’ve watched this vid tbh
=
솔라 개인무대 시작할때 리본이 너무 커서 볼때마다 생쥐 같아서 너무 귀여워
=
볼때마다느끼는데 응원봉진짜 독보적이다
=
3:56 설현 분 표정 너무 좋으셔서 뭔가 뿌듯했음
=
문별 댄서 부리면서 등장하는거봐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 언니 과해요!!! ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
okay everyone, you gotta be prepared for their comeback, you hear me?? that’s our fight for them
=
오ㅏ..마마무 콘서트 온줄알았네
미쳐떵 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
HWASA DROPPING IT IN FRONT OF ALL OF OUR SALADS
=
_I'm just a simple person, I see MAMAMOO I_*cLiCk_*
=
PUSS???!! 
OH MY GOD!
=
그냥 한명한명 무대가 너무 완벽하다 무대장악력 하며, 가창력하며 뭐하다 뒤지는게 없다 이번 무대는 개성이 넘치다 못해 터졌음
=
4:28 내  최애순간 ㅎㅎ
=
solar rapping is life😭😭💗💗💗
=
ㅠㅠ봄이 눈빛이 슬퍼ㅠ
=
I DIED😆❤❤
=
I like how every member has their time to show their style
=
They freaking slayed the stage...  BOOYAH!!
=
mamamoo and gidle own this show
=
that ending tho
=
*THE P O W E R*
=
hwasa makes my jaw drop every time i watch her on the stage, she's honestly amazing
=
3:55 설현님 표정 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진심으로 행복해보여요:-)
=
2:09 hyuna? :D
=
3:57 여기 나만 좋나? 랩을 노래하듯이 하니까 너무 좋다
언니 사랑해 언니가 짱이야
=
THEY ARE SO CHARISMATIC
=
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT DURATION BETWEEN REACTION INCLUDED VERSION AND ANOTHER ONE  TO SEE HOW SURPRISING, INTERESTING AND AMAZING THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS!!!!
Ps: I'm a Moomoo Vlogger. First time I've got this many likes ever! Our girls always deserve more. Hope they'll get recognition and success as much as their level of talent soon...
=
2:09 지호 반응 개귀여워ㅋㅋ큐ㅜㅠ
=
1:51 이랑 4:09 지민 반응하는거 두번 넣음ㅋㅋ
=
This is what mamamoo can do world! One of the best group to entertain the crowd
=
I will give this performance no 1!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
=
As an international fan , All I can do is watching mamamoo’s songs on queendom watching frequently as support. Wish I could vote in person
=
Came back here for idk how many times and shocked because there's a lot of korean comments lately which is really unusual.
=
4:10 지민 표정 너무 조아 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Amazing cover!
=
2:10 존나귀엽다 진짜
=
THEY👏SING👏LIVE👏
NO👏LIPSYNC👏
=
1:51 이랑 4:10  똑같넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 역시 엠넷
=
IM IN COMPLETE SHOCK
=
2:12 MYY MANN
=
simple.....my queens forever i love you mamammooooooooo
=
한 번만 본 사람은 절대 없다는 전설의 영상
=
They are amazing!!!!
=
미친사람들ㅠㅠㅠ커버곡하랬더니
콘서트만들고왔어ㅠㅠ미쳤어ㅠㅠㅠ존나 사랑해❤❤❤👍👍👍👍
=
솔라 나오기 전에 솔라~? 이렇게하는거 엄청 좋닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
진짜 우리 맘무 때문에 소름돋아서 닭 되겄어 !!!! 최고야...사랑해 정말로 ㅠㅠ
=
Damn i'm in love with Moonbyul💕💕💕
=
4:40 카메라 옆으로 슥 움직이면서 잡는거 왤케 멋있냐
=
Mamamoo: give me your songs we gonna make a cover
Other girl groups: *run*
=
Oh f- so many talent at once. My head is spinning from that charisma
=
1:51 이랑 4:10 똑같음ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 편집ㅋㅋ
=
진짜 볼때마다 느끼는데 문별 랩 너무 잘해
=
0:51  진짜 예술..
=
"Mamamoo can only sing live because they can't dance"

Say that again?
=
아 진짜 좋아서 계속 보는데 누가 댓글로 솔리 김장하러온 백조같다라고 한것때메 그거만 생각나넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
솔라 으엌! 소리로 의도치않게 라이브 인증하네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
ooooh
0:51 okay im just dead this is TOOO hot!!!
1:17 omg how tf cool she is
2:09 aaaahh is it legally to be soooo hot????? im in gay panic
2:32 DIVA

4:07 FINALLY THEY GIVE SOLAR A RAP PART (i can feel how she loves it)
=
precious seolhyun 3:55 <3
=
I swear if wheein is not getting married with me im gonna die
=
omg hwasaaaa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
각자 다 색다롭고 화려하다 뮤지컬 같아 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
마마무는 뭐든 콘서트같아ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
solar is such a mommy i can't
=
Did they.....just.... incorporate Jimin's 'Puss' in 'Good luck'???
This has to be one of the best Korean Variety shows ever. 
I demand more shows for girlgroups like THIS.
=
진짜 마마무언니들 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ완전즐기시네요 긴장도없이
=
3:55 설현이 행복하고 즐거워보여서 마음이 좋다 ㅜㅜ...
=
I just love this concept soo much
=
3:24
THAT PERSON WITH THE BISEXUAL FLAG ON HER/HIS WRIST. YESSS
=
퀸덤 무대는 더할 것 없이 좋지만 편집이 너무 어수선함  끊고 다른 참가자 멘트 넣고 무대 다시 전꺼 보여주고 편집없이 쭉 이어지게 보였으면 진짜 뮤지컬처럼 느껴졌을듯
=
문별이 뀨응!ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ커엽
=
3:55 설현 웃는모습 보면... ㅋㅋㅋ
  연말 시상식 때 마마무가 애드립 무대 할때 
  조인성이 웃고있던 빙구 웃음 같아서 넘 좋아 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 잘생쁨 설현 ♡
=
JAW DROPPING WOW.
=
진짜 무대를 즐긴다 너무좋아
=
Hwasa's stage presence is on another level. She has such a strong charisma that it makes me say STEP ON ME QUEEN HWASA
=
Can we just take a moment to Appreciate their beautiful healthy bodies. They are one of the few female idols that dont look like theyre being starved
=
화사 받고 문스타 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
커버하랬더니콘서트를하내ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Rapper Solar snapped!!
=
MNET: its okay to lip sync
SOLAR: APOLOGISE TO MY MIC NOW
=
mamamoo！！！
=
I don't even understand why this has so few views! It's such a great performance and cover!
=
Jimin: :O
=
Honestly Hwasa and Solars solo arrangement could work for the whole song
=
화사보면.. 그냥 이게 바로 '끼'다 이러는거 같음 ...
=
또 보러옴 이무대는 화사도입부에서 이미 찢어짐
=
오우씨 내가 상대편이였으면 전의를 상실했을듯ㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅌㅋ
=
흐엉엉ㅠ 아무리 보고 들어도 자꾸 더 생각나고 머리에 맴도는 무대에요..ㅠㅠ 마마무 진짜 영원해애...ㅠㅠ
=
제 눈에는 마마무의 색이 더 확실히 드러나서 좋은것같은데...?
전혀 조잡해보이지않고 각자의 색깔이 어우러져서 더 개성있고 좋았는데
=
Who in here have a flashback when Solar said "i'm a mother father top madam"? 😂
=
이 무대는 그냥 화려하고 애들이 잘한다고만 생각했는데 에오에 노래 찾아듣다가 지민 노래가 들어있다는거 알고 진짜 준비많이했구나를 새삼 깨달았다
=
Ohmaigoodness, I'm getting wrecked by Moonbyul
=
응 이번 솔라가 지민puss 랩 했다고 지민님 puss할때 욕많이 먹었다고,
 그 시절 지민님 조롱하는거아니냐고, 무례한거아니냐고 했던 사람들 반성하세요.
=
3:55 설현빵긋 ㅠㅡ 예쁨
=
I love how they made this song feel like their own it didn't feel like a cover
=
와...진짜 역시 마마무
난 이 하나에무대에서 모든장르를 봤다..
=
진짜 콘서트같다 너무 좋아
=
자기들 평소에 하고 싶었던 컨셉으로 나와서 즐기고 경연하면서 이렇게 할 그룹 마마무 뿐이야 진짜
=
아 마마무 진짜 잘하는데... 본인들이 너무 잘하는걸 아니까 있는대로 다 넣은 느낌.....

노래는 정말 잘하는데 무대는 좀 난잡했음..
=
they were suppose to give us one mamamoo version of good luck but damn they gave us five versions and that ladies and gentlemen is what we call  mother of all performance
=
Oh my Wheein stole my heart
=
그냥 마마무는 데뷔할 때부터 경력 5년차 관록 보여주는 걸그룹이어서 놀랍지도 않습니다







는 개뿔 와 이거 개지리네
=
Color me impressed! what wasn't I listening to them before? I stan
=
마마무 짖짜 춤잘추는거 인정해야됨ㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠ
조회수👍솔라 넘어질뻔한거 너무 대처잘한듯
마마무 놓지않을게
=
Hwasa is definitely the Queen. Wow I mean just W O W.. Her aura, existence, her everything. I can't take my eyes off her every moments.
=
이건 진짜 질리지가 않은다 계속계속 생각나는 무대인듯 진짜 한번도 안 본 사람은 있어도 한번만 본 사람은 없다는 말이 이 무대를 위한 말인거 같다
=
loooool wheein coming down from the piano with a step thingy
=
so damn AMAZING Y R THEY STILL NOT APPRECIATED ENOUGH
=
I have no idea what this is for or from but that was AMAZING!
=
차라리 얘내가 식스센스햇으면 파급력 더쩔엇을텐데 휘인 진짜이쁘네
=
You contend so good 💗💗💗💗
=
이거 보고 무무됬어ㅜㅜ
=
확실히 특급은 다르지?ㅋㅋㅋ
=
mamamoo is next level omg
=
휘인 퀸덤이 ㄹㅇ 리즈다 존나이뻐 걍 ㄹㅇ로 존 나이쁘다 ㅠ 개천사
=
또 봐도 소름 돋넹 후후 좋군♡♡😍
=
oh my god, they're killing me
=
솔라 넘어질뻔해서 지리는 가창력 탄로남ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I love it!!!
=
와 얘넨 무대해야지가 아니고 무대놀러가야지 이런 느낌이네 실력이 남으니까 그 남는데서 나오는 여유가 너무좋다
=
와...ㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋ진짜 쩐다..
=
4:06 초에 지민 언프리티랩스타 노래가사 나오네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 반응봐
=
Woah I'm an elvis and, yeah, this kinda shocked me 'cause I always heard AOA version and when I heard Mamamoo's version I was just like O.o 
WoW this is amazing. I still like better AOA's version but now I have 2 Good Lucks in my Spotify playlist.
=
꺄~!!!계속 보는데 역시! 마마무 언니들 너무 좋아~!!!!!>♡<
=
Don't let Loco see this, I Repeat DON'T LET LOCO SEE THIS
=
mamamoo saying good luck to us because next thing you know we be on the floor dead.😂😂😂😂
=
PERFECTION
=
커버 너무 좋아서 가끔 오는데 갑자기 고무장갑으로 보이기 시작했어 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ큐ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
솔라 지민랩 힐때 개이쁨...
=
Why didn’t I stand them before?!?!? I have listened to twit by Hwasa and famous songs by mamamoo like egoistic but this is bomb
=
5:00 Me pregunto si BOM estaría pensando en 2NE1 en ese momento? 😢
=
Omg whein so sexy
=
Speechleeeeeeessss.
=
There was a lot happening I...
=
이정도 수준이면 원곡자 곡 커버 수준이 아니라 재창조 수준.. ㅎㄷㄷ;; 그리고 04:59 박봄 표정이 "하...x발.. 산다라박, cl, 공민지 존나 보고싶다.." 이러는거 같음. 투애니원 현역시절이면 다른 걸그룹 뭘해도 안되던 시기..
=
휘인언니ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 점점 예뻐짐... 하 언냐.....
=
moonbyul just questioned my sexuality wtf
=
2:09 아임 더 탑
=
마마무는 평가한다는 게 의미가 없지 않나 ...
어떤 팀의 노래를 불러도 마마무 노래가 되는데다
멤버간의 궁합이 너무 좋아서 퍼포먼스에 빈 틈을 찿는다는 것 자체가 불가하고 찐한 끼'보다는 흥'이 ㅎㄷㄷ 한데다 지루할 틈도 없는 무대장인그룹이라 ...
=
This is what I call being an artist.

Mamamoo reasembled their concerts and career through this whole performance:
- The intro on the screen with Good Luck acapella / Um Oh Ah Yeah video acapella
- Hwasa bossy and raggae stage / her debut as a solo artist with 'Twit' (the choreography is similiar) and 'Don't' feat. Loco (the raggae vibes)
- Moonbyul slaying with her men chained up / her performance of 'Moon Movie' at S/S Concert 2018
- Solar being sexy af while kicking off the chair / her performance of 'Fever' and 'Fire' by BTS at F/W Concert 2019
- Wheein laying on her piano and being fatal as hell / her performance of her solo '25' at F/W Concert 2019


Mamamoo literally made their own concert in 5 mins.


p.s. at F/W Concert 2019 Solar managed to rap Moonbyul's part in their Debut Song called Mr. Amibiguous.
=
MAMAMOO QUEENS
=
Park boom look  so sad when she watch the mamamoo performed maybe she thinks her previous girl gruop and it reminds of her.
=
솔라 발 헛디딜때 저걸 라이브라고 실감했다 ㅎㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ 솔라짱 다이스키
=
2:09 언니 너무해 ㅜ
=
I can't take my eyes off Hwasa. She is a Queen of Koop.
=
Bruh MNET tried to sabotage Jimin soo much WTF. They used the same Jimin reaction for Moonbyul and Solar’s part. MNET needs to stoppp

Edit: I love the performance btw it was mind blowing and beautiful!!! These QUEENS SLAY ALL DAY!!!!
=
my heart 💀💀💀
=
화사는 양파망을 써도 예쁘네
=
MAMAMOO SLAYED SO HARD OMGGG !! ❤❤ I LOVE HOW FEARLESS THEY ARE WITH THEIR CONCEPTS!! YESSS!!
=

=
현장 일반관객 평가 7000점 만점을 받은 무대. 무대가 통일되지 않은 것 같다, 요란하다 평하지만 직접 라이브로 보고 들으면 그런 생각이 들 여유가 없음ㅋㄱㅋㅋ
=
아니 너네가 어떤 장르를 좋아할지 몰라서 다 준비했다는 댓글 있는데 그 장르가 다 가능한게 제일 멋져 하
=
it is time for me to stan
=
화사 진짜 사랑한다 와 디바야 디바
=
Boom🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
=
If i didn't know better, I'll be thinking that goodluck is their own song. They didn't just cover the song, they freaking owned it for 4 minutes damn that's mamamoo right there
=
Mamamoo can do anything and i love them for that
=
04:59 박봄표정 : 나도 다라랑 CL이랑 민지랑..다같이 나와서 즐기고싶다...시무룩

=
화사는 노래는 넘잘하니까 말할것도 없고, 춤출때 보면 몸을 잘쓰는거 같다.
간단한 동작도 화사가 하면 느낌이 엄청 다름.
=

ㄹㅇ 마마무팬은 아닌데 마마무 콘서트는 진짜 한번쯤은 꼭 가야겠다는 생각이 들었음 저렇게 매번 다르고 멋진 무대를 보여주면 콘서트때는 얼마나 더 대단할지 너무 잘했음
=
4:29 어 내가 화사야
=
진짜 마마무는 소화를 못시키는 노래가없네
=
왤케 도둑들 영화 생각나지 솔라는 전지현이 맡았던 역에다가 휘인은 김혜수이 맡았던 역 생각남

=
IHFINICNSXA OMGGGGGG YESSSSS GIRLSSSSSS
=
The best performance
=
무대를 보여줘야 할 타이밍에 리액션 나오고 리액션 타이밍에 무대를 보여주는 느낌이네ㅋㅋ 
저 무대를 편집으로 이렇게 깍아먹는 것도 능력이다 참
=
The best!!! Mamamoo #1👏👏👏
=
난 화사가 너무 크게 느껴져서.. 점점 처져 ㅠ 그러다 또 화사가 살린다잉
=
믿듣맘무ㅠㅠㅠ
=
마마무가 퍼스랩했다고~ 옷짧다고~제스쳐이상하다고 별의별 욕은 다하더니 다른 그룹이 할땐 입싹다고 오히려 멋있다ㅇㅈㄹ 하는 이유좀 대줄사람 제발
=
Am I watching Immortal songs? They're the greatest artist and performers...
=
그 댓글ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 너희가 어떤스타일을 좋아할지 몰라서 일단 다 때려박아봤엌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

=
4:59 박봄 누님.. 투에니원 생각나시나보시네 .. ㅜ
=
Moonybul destroyed me
=
사람들이 왜 화사 화사 거리는지 이 무대 보고 알겠음... 진짜 무대장인이란 말이 그냥 나온 게 아님..! 독보적이다 화사
=
박봄 가끔씩 쓸쓸한 표정 나오는데 너무 아프다.........
=
that was powerful
=
후우우ㅜㅇ 하악항미친 하악 하악
=
리액션을 얼마나 넣었으면 풀버전이랑 차이가 1분이 나니ㅠㅠ
=
byul be really giving all these male idols a run for their money. why be straight when moon byulyi the korean lesbian goddess exists?

EDIT: wow since this is getting big, let me just clarify that no, byul is not a lesbian. but straight or not, she's just really out there being her damn handsome but also pretty self, making even the straight girls swoon. and of course the lesbian ones go even more crazy. 96:4 female to male ratio for a fanmeet is something big, yup
=
와 나 이거 오늘 시험치는데 귀에서 맴돌아서미ㅣ치느줄 ㅜ
=
휘인 왤케 이쁘지?
=
이 프로는 마마무가 실력적으로 압살하는 분위긴데 다른가수들노래가 유튭에 더 잘보이는거같음
=
かっこよすぎて鳥肌たった
=
화사 백댄서들이랑 의상 똑같고 멤버들 사이에서 튀는 의상도 아닌데 그냥 실력으로 다 커버해 버리네... 약간 김치에 배추같은 존재감
=
I didn't even notice solar tripping before wtf..?
=
진짜 마마무가 인기 있을 수 밖에 없는 이유가 이 영상에 다 담겨있다.
=
Jimin's face at 4:10....
=
진짜 마마무 뽕 오오지게 찬다
=
This is great
=
문별 멋있다..
=
러블리즈야 이게 걸크고 섹시다
=
엔딩 미친다...무무할 맛 난다...언니들 사랑한다....
=
I feel bad for them. They performed with all their hearts and still the hate comments come out, saying that there are too much different concepts in just 4 minutes so that they can't hear anything like the original version. What??? Mnet told them to COVER, that means they can creat their own styles into the song. If they just sing the song again with no different, it is not a cover anymore.
Btw, in MooMoos' eyes, our girls are doing such a good job ❤️
P/s: okay Mnake 🐍, you don't need to edit again and again one scene, make the vid 5:36 long so that the views... 🙃
=
무대를 제일 즐기는건 마마무 같다
=
2:20   뒤에 빽댄서 솔라 머리카락에 맞았는데요ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅠㅠ
=
마마무가 니노래 내노래를 시전하였습니다..
=
마마무랑 오마이걸 무대 보면서 드는 생각은 이 분들 무대는 연말무대에서 자주 보고싶다는 생각이 든다. 무대를 너무 잘 활용하고 너무 멋있게 잘한다. 진짜
=
걍 화사버전으로 쭉갔어도 나쁘지않았을텐데
=
원본과 이거랑 보니까 이게 더 파워풀하다
=
진짜 멋있가
=
MY QUEENS ARE HERE
=
깜짝이야 다칠뻔 용똔이 라이브인증!
=
이거봐 화사는 댄서분들이랑 옷이 거의 비슷해도 안묻히잖아 ㅠㅠ 개인 재량인듯 ㅜㅜㅜ 개쩔어 사랑해 퀸사 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 화사바께안보여 첨 무대 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ

=
화사 개 짱 멋진 선장같다
=

Sexy sporty
Sexy swag
Sexy cute 
Sexy classic
=
이때 다 마음에 들었는데 솔라 의상이 좀 맘에 안들었음.. 원피스인지 수영복인지도 모르겠고 힐도 불편해보인다.. 중간에 한번 넘어질뻔 했을때 진짜 심장 떨어지는줄..ㅠ
=
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
=
내가 이 영상을 얼마나 봤는지는 모르겠는데... 랩파트를 다 외운건 알겠어....
=
Wohoooo amazing 👏👏👏
=
솔라 미쳤어... 언니 날 가져요 엉엉
=
화사 레게톤으로 솔로곡 한번 더 나와줬으면 좋겠다
=
아.. 무무는 죽습니다.. 하아.. 햄보카다.. ((퍽
=
Solaring rapping in that outfit... oof
=
esperaba ver a 2ne1 ahí :c
=
뮤지컬아니냐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ?
=
순위 선정 방식은 거지같지만 그래도 퀸덤 프로그램 자체는 마음에 듬... 이런 멋진 커버 무대도 볼수있고... 솔직히 시상식에서나 이런거 보지ㅜㅜ 마마무 aoa 박봄 다 멋있었음
=
WHAT THE!!!! 😱😱😱😱😱
=
Can I be part of the fandom?
=
화사님 더 자신있게- 부분 힘주면서 끊어지는 거 개치인다
=
1:50
4:09  우려먹기
=
damn these girls know how to put on a show, mamamoo never disappoints.
=
I'm shocked by wheein
=
와 쓰바 역시 마마무 클라스가 다르다 ...진심 영상만봣는데도 넋나갓다 현장 사람들 난리난거보니까 개부럽당 ..뮤지컬인지 콘서트인지모루것다 개쩔어
=
솔라가 지민 puss랩 한거 조롱할려고 넣은거다 어쩌구 하시는 분들 복붙 리액션 나오기 전의 잠깐 나오는 지민얼굴 잘 봐주세요 웃고 있음. 본인은 좋아하고 이번에 무대에서도 했는데 왜 자기혼자 궁예해ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
moonbyul im gay for you
=
솔라 강제라이브인증ㅋㅋㄱㄱㄱㄱㄱㅋ
=
와..마마무는 1번째 순서 인데도 2위를 하다니...솔찍히 1번째면 잇혀질만한데..대단하다..
=
Solar what are you doing with your chest
=
0:59도 그렇고 중간중간 민니 맞나요?  리액션 너무 귀여워.....
=
I really love mamamoo ughh
=
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOLAR'S RAP!!! SHE SLAYED MY WHOLE EXISTENCE!
=
진심 마마무는 안좋아할수가 없는 가수다.
=
원곡이 생각 안 나.. 넘 조아 ｡ﾟ(ﾟ´Д`ﾟ)ﾟ｡
=
언니들은 승마장 오지마세요 말이 안 나오잖아
=
화사 무슨 데스파시토에 나올만한 비쥬얼이네
=
한명씩 나와도 충분히 무대가 차니까 이런 구성이 가능한듯
=
Mamamoo never disappoints. They hit you from every direction at the same time. Amazing, the talent these 4 artist have. Each member killing it.
US MooMoo? Hell yes!
=
문별 분량좀 챙겨줘라 ㅠ
=
0:12 is that Jimin? What happened she looks different.
=
왜 문별언니 얘기가 없지 진짜 개까리한데 언니 너무 멋져요 진짜 첨에 나올때 남자둘 목걸이 잡고 끌면서(?)나오는거 미치는줄ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
I had a heart attack suddenly when Solar tripped... Please keep safe!!! But the professionalism remain
=
네 가지의 다른 섹시...
=
설현 진짜 예쁘다,,,,
=
Perfect
=
mamamoo are too good holy shit
=

=
근데생각해보니깐 지민이 커버곡경연때 언플때 파이널대결한 치타나오고 파이널대결레썼던 포스노래나와서 반가웠겠다
=
CL은 무대를 씹어먹고
마마무는 무대를 쌈싸먹는다
=
4:10
1:51
=
화사 노래부르는거 쫀득해서 좋음
=
하 진짜 너무 멋있다 솔직히 오바했다고 생각했는데 아니네 노래를 살린거였음
=
휘인 파트 ㅁㅊ어... 몇 번째 보는지 모르겠다...
=
난 저게 라이브였다는게제일소름끼침
=
아니 처음에 문별이 끈 잡고 있었는데 개멋있다
=
just letting y’all know that you can download the studio version on itunes and spotify!!!
=
Moonbyul must be so uncomfortable doing those sexy moves😂, she doesn't like hip moves😂
=
I love you Mamamoo 😍
=
다들 너무 멋지다 진짜 사랑해ㅠ
=
역시..마마무 넘사벽
=
아..편집 진짜 이젠저런거 너무 올드한거아닙니까 저렇게 무대 다 보여주지도않고 중간중간 끊는건 가수에대해서도 시청자에 대해서도 예의가 아닙니다..제발 개선좀 부탁드립니다
=
4:17 jakajs ja js
=
솔라님 미끌거려서 강제 꿀라이브 인증해버림
( 사실 마마무는 립싱크 원래 안한다구 )
=
I'm still pissed that this didn't put in 1st place argh
=
At 4:57 Yuqi Soyeon and Minnie were like 🤯🤯🤩
While the others are like
😐😐😐
=
I just realized that Mamamoo is a little bit like a mix of 2NE1 and Girls' Generation.
Hwasa and Moonbyul have 2NE1 vibe and honestly Solar and Wheein give me SNSD vibe. Great mix, perfect group!
=
화사가 ㄹㅇ 독보적
=
아니 소름 돋다못해 닭이 됐어요..!? 지려버렸다...🙊❤
=
Can you just let us enjoy the whole song without that x reactoin
=
❤❤❤❤❤
=
That tiny aigoo sound from Solar when she tripped, proof that the queens never did the lip syncing. Keep safe Queens 👑
=
솔라씨 조심하세요.... 넘어질뻔 ㅠㅠ
=
진짜 지민 표정 똑같은것만 세개나온다 엠넷아;;;;
=
솔라 휘인 시바 존나 이뻐;;
=
im freaking speechless when solar sang puss
=
They’re just doing what they do best, being themselves. I’m all here for it.
=
I didnt know that mamamoo can be more hotter than usual wow
=
솔라! 괜찮아요!(3:31)
=
Yeeeeeeeeeesssssss i dieing for mamamoo
=
와 무대를 찢어 놓으셨다
=
아 그냥 다들 즐기는거 같고 무대 하나하나 별로인게 없는데 그냥 경연이고 뭐고 엠넷이고 나발이고 다같이 손잡고 1등하면 안되나ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
화사 노래에 힘줄때 목소리 너무 좋음 자쉰있게! 레츠 께림! 할때 목소리 ㅠ
=
QUEENS MAMAMOO
=
Im so gay for moonbyul
=
아니 마마무 개쩐다 문별 진짜 진짜 개 쩐다 ;;;;;;;;;하
=
I really like this concept 😭 their agency let them with their own concept , i mean 4 of them have different style 😍
=
누가 솔라보고 김장하러온 백조랬어..ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ솔라 너무 예쁘다
=
Mumu of reacttothek should react to this. She'll be slayed.
=
SOLARS PART IS EVERYTHING
=
Omg i like more mamamo version
=
넘사,,,,
=
미치겠다 중독성 개쩔어 1일 1영상 합니다;
=
이 무대 보고 aoa good luck 보고 왔음 두 노래 다 좋음( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
=
역시 마마무죠 입닥하고 스물이십팔백오천번 돌려보면 됨
=
when solar covered jimins unpretty rapstar verse, damnn gurl I was shook when SOLAR STARTED RAPPING. Shes really living her dream, first the bow in her hair now the rap hahah yes girl
=
역시 믿듣 마마무
=
콘서트다..
=
화사파트 계속 소름돋네
=
화사 파트때 댄서분중 한명이 베인비슷하네요
=
SHUT DA EF UP!  SOLAR JUST DID JIMIN'S "PUSS" FROM UNPRETTY RAPSTAR. OH MY GOD I'M DYING!
=
애기 목소리 내고 안되는 애교 하는 애들보다 이런애들이 훨씬낫지
=
화사 도입부보고 내 표정이 ‘화사’  해진다
=
AE MAMAMOO ARE SO FANTASTIC
=
역시 마마무 미텼다 ♡♡
=
화사 무대 퍼포먼스만 보면


어디 남미쪽에서 살다온얘같어..
=
I cried because they are so amazing
=
원래 맘무 노랜줄
=
갑자기 든 생각인데 소연이랑 화사랑 같이 팀 먹으면 완전 쩔 듯...한 번이라도 좋으니까 둘이서 같이 무대 하는 거 보고 싶다
=
솔라 인트로 스칼렛 느낌이다
=
역시 이게 잴맘에드네
갠적으론 노래 안부를땐 마이크 내라는게 잴 멋있음 ar깔아도 라이브는 한다 라는게 잘 느껴짐
=
다른분들은 어찌되겟다 예상한대로엿는데.......마마무는....ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ 클라스ㄷㄷㄷ
=
moonbyullllllllll😭😭😍💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕✨✨✨✨
=
아주달콤하게하셧구만
=
화사도 멋있지만 문별이도 짱이야ㄷㄷ
마마무 짱이다ㄷㄷ
=
aoa 굿럭이란 노래자체가 원래 반복많고 자칫 단조로워서 지루해질수 있는데 마마무가 색다르게 꾸민듯함
=
근데 퀸덤에 나오는 댄서분들도 대박인듯
=
노래가 너무 조잡하다
=
let's give up on what if mamamoo sing good luck and watch this
=
솔라언니  넘어지실뻔한거 괜찮으신가....?
얼마나 열심히 하셨으면...ㅜㅜ
이 와중에도 열심히 하는 당신은 대체..♥️
=
마마무랑 에이오에이는 서로에 대한 리스펙을 가지고 서로에게 무대를 헌정한 느낌. (물론 다른 팀들도 마찬가지지만)
=
Queens at kpop
=
so addicting
=
Stan talent! Stanning Mamamoo
=
4:39  ME ARREPIEI TODAAAAAAAA
=
Can you guys recognize that they are singing 100% live ????? 
No lipsync at all!!!

That's MAMAMOO !! Im stanning the right and talented group ♥️♥️♥️🥰🥰🥰🥰
=
I know Solar tripped there but may I bring your attention to Byul's twerk😂 3:31
=
싫어요는 그 언냐들인가 ㅎㅎ
=
마마무가 진짜 대단한게
한곡으로 5가지를 보여줬다는거임. 솔라 넘어질뻔했는데 바로 표정 짓는거랑 그뒤로 안무 살살할법도 한데 최선을다해서 동작 크게하는거랑
휘인이는 컨디션 안좋고 몸도 안좋은데 다 소화했다는거. 심지어 굿럭은 20분밖에 연습 안햇댜
화사는 무대 도입부 진짜 중요한데 그걸 진짜 찰떡같이 소화함
아니 오히려 무대를 더 웅장하게만들어줌. 그거 진짜 어려운건데
문별도 갑자기 랩나오면 어색할법도 한데 하나도 안 어색하고 들었을때 완전 다른 랩이지만 굿럭인걸 딱 알게끔 잘함.
이게 마마무가 프로라는 증거다...
준비시간도 짧았을텐데.
=
이 무대가 말도안되는 의상트집 누구랑 비교하기 이상한 편집으로 묻혔다는게 너무 어이가 없네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ너무 잘했다
=
마마무팬은 아니지만 솔직히 마마무는 간지나는 무대의 맛으로 본다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
봄이언니의 표정은 도무지 알수가없단말이지..
=
마지막이 ㄹㅇ 쌉간지다
=
각자 노래 파트마다 분위기가 다르지만 어색하지 않게 잘 넘어가서 좋음 그리고 다들 의상이 달라도 어지럽지 않음
=
계속 보는데 안질려...
=
휘인이 어디아파요? ㅜㅜ 퀸덤보면 표정이 막예전에 장난스런표정도 없고 자주빠지는거 같아서요ㅜㅜㅜ
=
They went  O F F .
=
휘인 차례할때 카메라 끝까지 보여주고 돌리지 아깝.. 천으로 돌려서 나오는것도 한샷 아니고 그냥 휙.. 근데 이 무대가 중독되서 지금 한 5번은 보고 있네요..
=
갓마무
=
현장에서는 진짜 이건 미쳤다고 생각했는데 편집이 더 조잡스럽게 나오게 만든듯...그래도 역시 마마무👍
=
Before all the haters can and hate on this amazing performance. Mamamoo and aoa concept of good luck are different and not all girl groups are the same. Mamamoo add their own charm and uniqueness to good luck so if haters do not like this performance please understand that aoa and mamamoo are different
=
초아 보컬 그립다
=
길: 누가 날 자꾸 부르는겨

=
솔라 진짜 고생했어...
중간에 진짜 넘어질뻔했는데 당황하지 않고 무대 해줘서 고마워!!
맘무 1위 가자!!!!!!
=
I'm actually so gay for Moonbyul I'm not even kidding
=
이를 간 게 아니라 이 인간들 원래 걍 잘해요♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
=
hwasa work hard bcoz 1 legend parkbom..😀
=
엠넷 조작으로 시끄러운데 퀸덤만큼은 조작없이 편하게 보고 싶다! 그리고 악마의 편집 이런거 하지말아라!!!!! 소리질러 마마마마마마무~~~~~~~~

OMFG MAMAMOO IS THE BEST DECISION I'VE MADE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE


edit: I've never had so many likes so this only confirms that this indeed is the best decision lol - I love this fandom btw
=
화사, 저 건강미 어쩔거야~  하핳 센언니들~
=
뭐야 MAMA인줄 씹어묵네
=
Who’s that person that’s like they all went out bruh she pisses me off
=
Died 300 times watching this video. 😍😍😍
=
연말 가요대전 이런데서만 아니라 평소에도 아이돌들 이런 무대했으면 좋겠다...경쟁이 아니라 무대 구성 보는맛에 퀸덤 봄ㅜ
=
가수는 실력이다.
=
다 너무 예쁘고 잘했는데 이번거 휘인한테 치인다
=
Ok who is the girl at 1:51 and 4:09 that has the BEST REACTIONS🤣
=
마마무는 매 무대마다 연말무대보는거같음 진짜 잘한다
=
Is this a concert of Mamamoo? Because they killed it!!
=
Jimin's face
=
화끈한 무대 역시 마마무!!
=
다 보고 이게 5분 36초라는거에 놀랐다 겁나 긴것 같았는데
=
문별 존나 멋지다
=
확실히 프듀 이런거 보다가 퀸덤보니까 다르다.. 연습생들 보다가 프로 보니까 무대의 퀄리티나 무대 진행력이 호ㅓㄱ실히 엄청 다름 갠적으로 논란많지만 이런 프로 많이 하주면 좋겠다ㅠ 연습생 관심웂어ㅠ
=
지루해진 너에게난 얼음처럼 chill 솔라부분에 머리카락 휘날리고  딱쓸어넘기는 부분까지 펄풱
=
개조아......
=
어떤 의상을 입고 어떤 제스쳐를 해도 절대 논란이 안되지 평소 이미지가 ㄹㅇ중요하다ㅏ
=
Solar🥰
=
진짜 무대를 즐길줄 안다.
공연을 하는건지 경연을 하는건지
그냥 우리가 마마무고 
이게 우리가 노는 방식이다 라는걸 보여주는것 같음
보면서도 ㅈㄴ 빠져들게하는게
본인들도 하면서 와 재밋다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이런느낌으로 무대하시는것같아서 너무보기좋응
=
QUEEN PROVES
=
Wheein here looks just like Red Velvet Irene
=
하루에 적어도 3번 이상은 보는듯..
=
I GASPED SO MANY TIMES DURING THIS IT'S UNREAL. honestly, i shouldn't even be surprised at this point bc of how talented they are but WOW. LITERAL ICONS.
=
김장하로온 백조다..
=
I thought it was xiumin but its moonbyul hehehh
=
솔라언니 완벽하게 하고싶어했을텐데 실수해서 아쉽겠다 ㅜ
=
문별씨.. ? 카리스마 쩔어요!( 3:26)
=
나는 서바이벌 경연 무대에 잘 맞춰서 특색있게 해서 너무 멋있고 좋았다고 생각했는데....음반을 내는것도 아니고 경연 무댄데
=
와 역시 마마무 클라스 !!!! 
왜 이제서야 봣을까
마마무 노래처럼 소화하다니
=
개멋있다 ....,,
=
화사님 싸릉해여
=
문별 개멋있어;;
=
와.. 그냥 콘서트를 했네... 진짜 무대 제대로 찢었다..
=
솔직히 본방으로 처음볼때 각기 다른 컨셉때문에 마음에 확 와닿지는 않았음. 근데 음원도 들어보고 무대를 계속 보니까 진짜 마마무는 어나더 레벨. 모든 멤버 색이 확실하고 각자가 자신있는 모습으로 개인무대를 보여줬다는게 대단함. 퍼포먼스도 그렇지만 특히 보컬부분에서는 더 설명할 필요도 없다..... 한명이 부르더라도 소리가 꽉차면서 힘이 있는게 듣기 좋음. 맨처음이나 중간에 마마무의 목소리만 나오는 부분은 정말 장관임.
한편의 뮤지컬을 본느낌이다. 최고
=
I would like to hear it on spotify
=
4:03
=
GOD THIS OS WAY TOO SEXY AAAA
=
처음 시작할때부터 화사가 한것처럼 레게풍으로 노래 쭉 갔으면 대박이었을텐데....ㅜㅜ레게풍으로 한 풀버전 듣고싶다 엄청 중독쩔

+전 마마무팬도 아니고 그냥 제 생각 적은거에요^^;
레게풍이 좋은 사람도 있는거고 지금 이버전이 좋은사람도 있는거겠죠~
=
MY STARS
=
솔직히 내 갠적인 생각인데 도입부에 화사랑 같이 추는 백업댄서가 조금 표정연기가 사아알짝 오바한다는 느낌이 있었는데 백업댄서가 오바해도 화사 옆에 있으니까 걍 묻어져 버리네 저거 다른 사람옆에서 저렇게하면 막 백업댄서 논란 됬을수도
=
this is why i stan mamamoo
=
아니 화사님볼때마다 뭔가 캐리비안해적에 나오는여해적같아....
=
Luckily Yongsun didn't fall tho. My heart stops beating when she was slipped
=
와 미친 원곡보다 더좋아
=
차라리 화사가 식스센스 불렀으면..?
=
마마무랑 투애니원 노래로 대결한것도아닌데 비비질못한다 투애니원 짬이있는데 마마무가 어캐 이기냐 이딴 소리좀 하지마셈 ㅋㅋㅎㅋㅎㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋ
=
화사가 쓰면 스웩있는 모자 우리가 쓰면 원래 양파망인데 비누망으로 쓰다가 너덜해진거...
=
진짜 딱 4인 4색 개인 컨셉 살려서 너무 신선하고 멋있었음 괜히 무대장인이라는 수식어가 붙는게 아닌듯 뒤에 고음 애드립 ㄹㅇ소름
=
옴마나 너무 잘하잖아 서로 노래뺏어부렸어
=
허쉬,,멋있어
=
저 화사 머리위에 저 빨간가 스타킹임...?
=
OK BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
=
Mamamoo just gave us 4 different interpretations of "GIRLS ON TOP"
=
Mamamoo nunca deja de sorprenderme... Son un gran icono del Kpop 💜
=
no offense but for me this one group and soloist, can win this compettion, it's between mamamoo sunbaemin and park bom sunbaemin.♥
=
아이돌관심없는 내가, 몇년동안 고민없이 가장 좋아하는 무대는 마마무 무대임. 모든 무대에서 정말 즐기는거같아서 보는 나도 행복해짐. ㅠ
=
마마무가식스센스해도잘하겠다..
=
화사는 진짜 솔로가 잘안될수가없을거같네
화사는잘될수밖에없는게 무대장악력이랑 곡을 자기걸로 흡수하는수준정도가..말이 ㄹㅇ로 안되는데..? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
멍청이 처음에 나올때도 약간 충격적으로 너무 곡도 좋고,컨셉도 너무 좋고 의상하고 무대 모든게 완벽해서 진짜 놀랐는데,
그래도 곡도좋고 프로듀서가 오지게 똑똑한가보네,이런 생각이 좀 있었는데, 
화사라는 사람자체가 그냥 물건이었다....
무대에서 저렇게 멋있는 사람진짜,,완전한국의니키미나즈잖아 ㅜ 
아이돌들정도의 깜냥이아니다저건 
진짜 ㄹㅇ 크게되겠다... 최고다
=
문별님 모자안썼으면 후어어어얼씬 멋있었을긋 ㅜㅜ
=
Moonbyul ya about to kill me!
=
역시 실력파 그룹 마마무
믿고 봅니다!!
=
Wow 💕💕💕

화사 개 미쳤네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
초반 장악력 뒤진다 진짜

진짜 화사 퍼포먼스는 압도적재능이다;;
=
Nothing can stop Solar 🔥
=
화사 머리에 스타킹 쓰고온줄
=
"mamamoo have stable voices because they don't have hard dances"

they said
=
ㅈㄴ 궁금한데 4:03에 문별 그냥 넘어진거 아님? 마이클 잭슨도 저 각도에선 못 버틸듯
=
1:52
4:05
=
when I see this for the first time, I didn't notice that solar slipped. She is a pro!
=
와 미쳤다.. 입벌리고 봄.. 팬 다됨... 그나저나 휘인 개이쁘다 진짜 미쳐따..
=
퀸덤 6팀 시작 전 마마무가 타팀에 비해 확실하게 가지고 간 특징은 멤버들 개개인의 확실한 개성, 탄탄한 라이브실력, 강력한 보컬 이렇게 3가지라고 생각했습니다.

이 무대는 마마무의 강점과 개성이 모두 드러난 무대였기에 더 좋은 평가를 받지 않나 싶네요. 화사의 레게, 문별의 트랩, 솔라의 뮤지컬, 휘인의 팝에 솔라의 깜짝 랩까지. 전혀 연결고리가 없는 4가지 음악을 하나의 무대를 '마마무'라는 이름으로 연결한 이런 무대는 아마 한국 걸그룹 중에서는 마마무만이 가능할 겁니다.

반면 약점 또한 확실합니다. 바로 팀으로서의 통일성은 부족합니다. 오마이걸이나 aoa의 무대에 비해 이 무대가 조잡해보일 수도 있습니다. 마마무는 그 통일성을 강력한 라이브 록으로 채웠다는 점에서 그 약점을 커버하는 모습을 보여줬네요.

아씨 걍 다 필요없고 다음 무대 보고 싶네요...
=
1:51
=
They captured my sexuality with this one.
=
원곡이 있는건가
=
Kumbaga sa isang room sila yung pabibong group HAHAHAHAHAHAHA loveyouuuu
=
Mamamoo can't dance huh? Plus with that LIVE vocals? 😏
=
I fell in love 😍



I wish I'm not late to be a fan.
=
마마무 팬들은 콘서트 갈 맛 나겠다
=
so greattttttttt
=

=
화사가 러블리즈보다 경례잘하네
=
1:17
=
I think we all needed this 2:07
=
Mamamoo are crazy insane 😍🔥🔥💜 On fireee
=
화사는 진짜 비욘세 리한나 느낌이다
=
*you know you're the queen when you make girls scream like that*
=
마마무가 마마무했다
=
I love mamamoo
=
그냥 대박
=
무대장악력 장난아니다,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 와,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 근데 솔라 괜찮은가? ㅠㅠㅠ

=
문스타 찢었다 시바 지민은 왜 랩이 안느냐 문스타 트랩 오지는데???
=
반주없이 네명이서 화음하는 부분 너무 조아
=
They didn't just covered this song, they freakin' owned it, slayed it. Well done my queens👸👸👸👸
=
솔라 저러다 다쳤구나 ㅠㅠ 저렇게 격한춤추는데 하이힐  ㅠㅠㅠ
=
0:22 이때 목소리 넘무 조음ㅜㅠㅠ특유의 음색이 진짜 개사기ㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜ
=
Mamamooooo whyyy can you do this to me??? The whole song gives me goosebumps! 💟 PERFECT PERFORMANCE
=
와 휘인 진짜 이쁘다...
=
Sorry because mamamoo is only Group is singing full live in queendoom?
=
미치뉴ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
🔥🔥🔥🔥
=
I can see how this made it to the top 2. They have a case for top 2. AOA fans were saying it doesnt sound like the original at all... Isnt that the point? Making a song your own? And the reason AOA only got third is because this has more should i say fan interactions. I have yet to watch the omg performance. I wanna see if it beats both aoa and mamamoo.
=
I started watching this stuff today because spotify had some songs and I was like queendom?? My girls covering other girls?? When did this all start and happened ndjdmejdnej
=
박봄보면서 느끼는건데 표정에서 자꾸 걸그룹때 생각하는것같음..
=
And wheein did all that despite being sick.i wonder what would she have done if she was fine.
=
I'm a neverland but I like this stage.This deserve 1st place😭💗🔥
=
풀버전으로 보세요. 풀버전으로 보고 이거 봤는데 편집이 무대를 망치는 느낌이 드네요. 진심으로 말하는데 편집 이렇게 하지 마세요 너무 별로네요
=
Gilaa sih lagu kalau mamamoo yg nyayi jadi warrbiasaahh💓💓💓💓💓
=
아니 이쯤되면 순위는 무슨의미야? 순위없애고 그냥 이렇게 콘서트 처럼 다같이 으쌰으쌰 했으면
=
Mamamooo99

=
와.. 진심 개잘한다... 식스센스보고 돌아다니고있는데 진심... 다잘한다 식스센스빼고
=
갠적으로 화사 목소리가 사긴듯..
=
다른곡들에 코멘안달아도 입쩍벌어지긴했는데 와 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 여긴 코멘 달 수 밖에없다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 박봄 말마따나 다들 이간거 훤히보이는듯 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Moonbyul me hace dudar de mi sexualidad.
=
이 무대가 관객평가 만점받은 무대인가요?
=
All audience vote for them👏👏 They get full mark for the audience vote😍😍
=
왜 휘인이야기는 안보이지ㅜㅜ 초반 혼자 할때부터 섹시하고 음색 좋아서 놀랐는데 4:53 여기보고 팬하겠다 마음먹었는데..
=
저 양파망 같은 모자는 진짜 화사니까 소화 가능한거다
=
원곡이 생각안나고 이게 원곡인듯한 파워풀함.....솔찍히 커버곡 경쟁은 맘무가 1위해도 당연할듯
=
화사 시작부터 지리고 와 문별 조련 미쳤고 솔라 마더뻐킹탑마담 도랏고 휘인이 언니 뭔말을 해도 철컹철컹할거같아서 말을 못하겠다 제발 다음 콘서트 때 해주세요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
원래 마마무노래인줄 알았어..
=
이분들 양산아이돌에 비교하면 안돼는 급인것 같습니다 진짜
=
마마무가 이런컵셉만 하는게 아니고 다양하게 하고있는데 사람들이 이런컨셉인 무대만 보는거임ㅋㅋㅋ올해만해도 동물잠옷,햄버거세트 의상,강아지분장 등 웃기고 귀여운컨셉의 무대도했었는데 컨셉이 어쩌구하는사람들은 이무대만보고 판단하고있는거
=
Solar:girl's girl's on top

Omfg moonbyul walking in with the guys on a chain. One of the hottest things i have ever seen. Plz god let me be the backup dancer next time moonbyul does that

Knetz are losing their tiny minds yet again. Who’s surprised?

Moonbyul went and wrote a whole new rap for this. Queen of rap, queen of lyricism! This is why she's the top credited in the 3rd generation 👏👏👏
=
Just wanna say I got BTS's War of Hormone MV as an ad and i didn't skip it
=
처음 방송으로 봤을때는 분위기가 너무 끊어지고 자주 바뀌는 거 같은 느낌이었는데, 들을수록 너무 좋다.. 무지컬보는 느낌이었고 갠적으론 화사 도입부랑 솔라 고음에 매료된 사람으로서, 넘 만족.. 음원 들으면서 비트까지 들어보니 하나로 연결되서 산만한 느낌이 안들음. 무대 찢어놨고 화사 도입부 분위기로 쭉갔어도 좋았을 거란 후기에 공감했음
=
갠적으로 볼때 5,6명 넘어가는 그룹은 노래가 약해도 춤 안무구상 잘추고 퍼포무대효과 좀 주면 좋지만 4명으론 보컬이나 애드립, 장악력이 안받쳐주면 백댄서 써도 무대공백 쉽게 못채움. 각자 몫이 크기도 하고.. 기대치가 낮을수록 잘하면 더 눈에띠는법인데 ..마마무 잘하는거 이미 알고 사람들 기대치가 높다보니, 왠만큼해도 맘에 안차는 사람도 있을거고 .. 그래도 지루하지않게 무대 꾸미려는거 보면 대단하다고 생각했음. 잘하긴잘함 ㅇㅇ
=
i think aoa reactions are not fully honest, they seem edited, i genuanily thought they would be more hyped, i am an elvis for 6 years and i fucking loved this
=
My mouth is still wide open and it hurts 😲😲😩❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
그냥 맘무 콘서트잖아....경연을 콘서트로 만들어벌임....
=
나만 너무 좋은가..? 무대가 끊기는 느낌은 받았지만 무대를 아주 그냥 갖고노는것같음,, 마마무 = 어나더레벨
=
근데 진짜 무슨 컨셉을 하든 화사같은 멤버 한 명 있음 든든할듯 그냥 멋있고 다 소화하자너
=
마마무가 니노래 내노래 스킬을 시전하셨습니다
=
Mamamoo perform like they are the veterans. Something that gg this era can’t do.
=
Why wheein so beautiful day by day
=
1:50 4:09 Same reaction🤔 Mnet edit it
=
화사 머리 스타킹이에요??
=
Whatever song Mamamoo sing become a bob 💙
=
Okay! No one can beat their vocal 😂
=
Basically moonbyul being better than any of your kpop boys
=
솔라 넘어질뻔할때 소연이가 웃은거 같은데... 아니것지
=
무대 너무 정신없다고 하시는 분들 풀버전이랑 이 영상이랑 1분정도 차이나는거 보고 풀버전도 보세요 가뜩이나 컨셉이 여러 개라 화려한데 리액션이나 똑같은 동작 또 넣어서 1분이나 불리면 어떡합니까 편집 진짜 아오...
=

라이브 존나 잘한다는거 확실히 박고 가네👍 솔라 넘어질때 소리랑 옆에 두드릴때 나는 천소리가 이 모든 것이 엠알이 아니라 라이브라는걸 알려줌
=
can someone please tell who's the girl at 4:26 please 😔
=
CALL AN AMBULANCE ASAP 1:21
=
Damn
=
Ma queens
=
진짜 실력이 탄탄하니까 한계가 없다,,,, 멋있다 멋있어
=
Okay mamamoo has no chill
=
Jimin's Face @ 4:09 😂😂😂😂😂
=
2:09
=
Putangina byul mamatai ako dadi WHEE JUSKO YUMMERZ
=
마마무는 보면 볼수록 무대를 진짜 즐기는 게 보여서 너무 좋아 그냥 다 각자가 좋아하는 스타일대로 해석해서 하는 게 넘 좋음
=
이게 1등 안한거에서 엠넷 조작 인정하는셈
=
ฮวาซากูคิดว่ายังโอม
=
왜 솔라 휘인 언니 관련은 없죠 저 솔라언니 후스넥 듣고 눈 커지고 휘인언니 컨셉에 숨 멎었는데!!!
=
3:26  나 왜 이번무대 문별 짱 좋지..ㅋㅋ원래 딱히 관심없는데...랩도 멋잇고 이때 표정이 멋잇엉
=
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ외국인댓에 막
엠넷: 너네 립싱크해도 되!
맘무: (얼탱쓰가방구쓰) 내 마이크 들고 걔한테 사과해
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
this permance Mamamoo saying: "don't mess with us!!!"
=
솔라 랩파트 아는 사람있으려나ㅜㅠㅜㅠㅠㅜ 지민 언프리티랩스타 가사인데ㅠㅜㅠ♥♥♥
=
솔라가 젤좋닼ㅋㅋㅋ난
=
걍 노래주인을 바꿨네 ㄷㄷ
=
아마들 노는데 장인이 와서 특별무대 하는 느낌ㅋㅋㅋ
=
솔라님 넘어질뻔하셨는데 바로 자세잡고 표정짓는거 너무 멋있잖아...ㅠㅠ
=
마마무는 볼때마다 너무 신기한게 랩그룹도 아니고 래퍼도 한명뿐인데 왤케 힙해..
=
마마무는 역시 마마무다 진짜 다르다 달라 개쩔어 ..
=
화사 노래 쫜득쫜득하다 진짜...
=
They got 2nd place with full audience votes!
=
문별 처음 나올때 퍼포먼스 개머시땅 ㅠㅠ
=
와 화사... 와... 대박..
=
for those who said that they are lipsync, your totally wrong MAMAMOO vocal is amazing you can't tell if they are lipsync or not. One thing about MAMAMOO last time they tried lipsync but ended up they dont like it because they said its harder to lipsync for them because they need to dance to the beat too. Remember you all that MAMAMOO is Queen they are VOCAL QUEEN and slaying all the time.
=
솔라 너무 이쁘고 멋지다 영화 시카고 출연할 거 같은 느낌 ㄷㄷ ♥️
=
무대장악력, 가창력이랑 여유가 남다른만큼 뮤지컬이나 오페라 컨셉 한번 해줬음 좋겠다ㅠㅠ아카펠라도 좋구....진짜 목소리가 최고의 악기란 컨셉으루 거의 막 성스러워 보이게...?오케스트라 불러서 성가대 같은 컨셉도 찰떡같이 소화할듯!!
=
진짜 솔라랩 음원에 안나와서 자꾸 영상보러와 ,,
=
Everytime I watch this, I still can't get over Moonbyul's swag. seriously, he girl crush power is too strong.... she is even cooler than a guy!!!
=
Some people really called this mess. I just saw the fun in this. They had fun performing this. I love it! This is number 2 or 3 for me!
=
Good Luck 마마무 버젼 오져따 ㄷㄷㄷ 아예 작살 내겠다는 심정으로 갈고 또 갈고 나왔네 ㄷㄷㄷ
=
나만 문별 랩 너무 좋나요..... 데뷔때 빡세게 으릉!하면서 랩하던 문별 생각나서 너무 좋았음 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 별이언니 절 가져요....★
=
4 seasons, 4 colors, 4 girls. Absolutely one word: STUNNING!!! 

can whee just chill like she's been bad for my heart lately,, :---(((
=
No one:
Solar: im the top ;)
=
I thought minhyuk of btob is in military? Why is he here? 😂
=
Their visual and talent are perfect 💯 damn these girls are truly fucking amazing
Also, i love moonbyul-oppar 🤧
=
아니 솔라 굽이 저렇게 높으니깐 넘어질뻔
하지ㅠㅠㅠㅜㅠ 진짜 자연스럽게 넘어가는
것도  대단하다 끝날때쯤에는 생각도 안났음
=
Compare 1:51 with 4:09. Same reaction footage lol, with slightly different zoom scale and footage duration.
=
Can we talk about their stage presence
=
마마무 👍👍👍 솔라 안다치길 😍 ...  랩은 문별 ~ 차원이 다르다. 라이브가 그냥 넘 멋지다.
=
2:11, yeahp that's me
=
why do they look so shocked lol i mean they’re mamamoo
=
Moonbyul.... i’m dying in her handsome and sexyness 🔥🔥🔥
=
Istg I've rewatched this so many times but I can't help feeling that even tho mamamoo had the stress of performing first twice they set the bar for the other teams very high
=
aaaaaaaa是我妈木了！啊啊啊啊啊啊！GOGOGO FIGHTING!!!!
=
They are not like every other femae kpop groups. MAMAMOO ARE REAL TALENTED ARTISTS. I stan pure talent!
=
Well , what do you expect ? Its Mamamoo Ladies and Gentlement ! 💜💜👏👏 My GG is on fire  🔥🔥
=
Woaaaa 😍😆👏🏻 Best 👍🏻 I like this stage 💚
=
*Sometimes i forget that hwasa is the maknae*
=
The moonbyul raps kills me 
Too perfect
=
i'm gay for moonbyul:)
=
For those not familiar with MMM,  I think the concept of MMM was to give off a 4 in 1 performance similar to their MAMA stage in Japan where they were wearing all-red. This performance is not meant to just be a recorded cover that you're supposed to listen to on spotify. This is a performance meant to be seen.
=
엔딩진짜 대박
=
진짜.. 마마무 너무 사랑해요😍 대학교축제때 오셨는데 아주 가까이서 본건 아니고 사이드? 왼쪽에서 봤는데.. 너무.. 진짜.. 뷰리풀 그 자체💕 마마무-넌 is 뭔들 이라는 노래를 어렸을때 접하고 나서 팬이 되었습니다. 노래방 가서 마마무 노래 많이 불러요!  랩에 관심이 생겨서 피아노맨 문별님 파트를 열심히 연습하고 있습니다💕 수고하셨어요!!!🔥🔥
=
Even though it's a cover song but still they killed it 😩😩😩😘
=
진짜 미쳤다.. 개멋있네
=
화사 누나 ㅠㅠ 누나는 아니지만 ㅠㅠ 화사 짱 ㅠㅠ
=
우리마마무 진짜 짱이다!
=
와오... 소름 여러번 돋았네요... 마지막에 진짜 동전던지는 모션까지 마무리 소름 쫙... 1~3위 팀들은 상대곡에 대한 이해도도 높으면서 자기팀의 장단점에 대한 이해도도 동시에 높으면서 편곡 무대연출력 랩추가 안무추가 등등 너무 잘하는것같아요!!
=
아 언니들 나 뮤지컬 보는 줄 알았잖아 ,, 너무 멋있잖아 ㅁㅊ ,,
=
4:08 Jimin from AOA got mad lol
=
They own the stage Periodt
=
콘서튼데..? ㄷ 개멋졍
=
I thought Rihanna is with them 😂😂😂
=
평소엔 못 느꺘는데 화사 독보적 ㄷㄷ
=
화사님......................... 와...우.... 화..사...님...
=
이건 아예 다른 노래인데

솔라 록시 같다...

=
Soooooo sexy. Luv u all<3 they r the best!
=
문별언니 사랑해요
=
화사는진짜...씹어먹네
=
SOLAR WHY SO STABLE?!!!😭😭💛💛
=
아진짜개대박돌았다미친
=
Actually i prefer this version than the original one


BTW the whos the next so sexy
=
아니 문언니 저거 하네스임? 코디누구세요 어디있음 절해줄게요.
=
All members in Mamamoo  enjoyed their stage very much, not just for competition or something else.  This is why I love them so much and repeat this video again and again. They always be true and powerful to show their special song , efforts, enthusiasm and  confidence 🥺 Love Mamamoo forever. ❤️❤️❤️
=
VOCAL QUEEEN PERFORMANCE QUEEN!!!!!! I LOVE YOU MAMAMOO!!
=
Mamamoo is the best in my heart ❤️
=
wheein in fishnets.... coming after my bi heart right there!
=
who's that girl with scars .. shes so cute
=
믿.보 믿.듣 마마무
=
Defintely MAMAMOO. Outstanding performance💜
=
Wth am I the only moomoo streaming or what? WHERE U AT FELLOW MOOMOOS????
=
와..지금 알았다..왜 다른 가수들 무대는 풀버젼이랑 그냥영상이랑 몇초 차이밖에 안 나는데 ㅋ 왜 맘무만 1분이나 차이나는거지? 이거 대결인데 진짜 불공평하네..영상보는데도 방해되고 이 영상 편집자 왜 그런거지..마마무 지게하려는것도 아니고 ..이건좀 아니라고 봄
=
SOLAR : I'M A MF TOP MADAM
ME : YES YES INDEED YOU ARE!!!!
=
as usual Mamamoo never dissapoint me. Hwasa you go girl. How can she become so charismatic on stage
=
확실히 마마무가 노래는 진짜 급이 다르게 잘하더라
=
박봄도 똑같이 4명이서 활동을 했었어서 바라보는 표정이 더 안쓰럽네..
=
QUEEEEEEEEENS!!!!!!!!!!!
=
화사 머리에 쓴거 내가쓰면 그냥 미친넘같을텐데 개잘어울리네
=
i love how no one in the comments didnt even say a word about when solar tripped
=
People who calls Mamamoo stage messy must never seen 4 people 4 colour concept. This is how they 4 perceived the songs and how they want to express it individually but still in 4 people harmony.
=
무대가 빈틈없이 완벽하니까 솔라 실수한거 전혀 신경도 안쓰니고 걍 멋있움
=
Lol the sexy battle between AOA and MAMAMOO is real! Not talking about skill, MAMAMOO, Bom, and AOA are the queendom battle and the rest are more like the Princessdom since they're younger :P
=
Mamamoo are the MF revolution. QUEENS! 😍
=
솔라 프로다...넘어질뻔 했어도 무대 끝까지 잘함
=
my korean mommies
=
I’m so sick of haters trying to discredit MMM and their efforts! The girls slay, whether you support them or not. They perform how they like, so you might as well focus on your faves. Our girls, despite constant hate come back better and unbothered.
=
OPPA BYULLIEEEEEE
=
The literally mad that song theirs
=
보여주고 싶은건 많은데 시간이 짧아서 뭘 볼만하면 바뀌니깐 뭔가 조잡함..
이 무대를 다른 팀이 했으면 개망하고 6위했을듯.
그래도 1군이니깐 무대가 조잡해도 잘하는거처럼 보이는듯
무대 총평 : 1군은 1군이다. 이런 무대도 살리는구나..
=
Still in awe of what happened, everybody was good. But only MAMAMOO is singing 100% live, shouldn’t Queendom make everyone sing live for a competition like this? Its not really fair.
=
Ok maybe I should stop commenting but I cant stop fangirling.
=
마마무 님이 니 노래 내 노래 스킬을 시전하였습니다.
=
Hwasa is so fierce, Moonbyul a handsome woman, Solar is so gorgeous and proffessional even if she slipped, and Wheein being sexy! AaaAaa they are so powerful!
=
our lead vocalist is rap..

im dead.
=
왜 휘인 얘기가 많이 없지? ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 하 너무 좋아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
마마무는 찍어나오듯 나오는 아이돌 음악과다르게 각 멤버들에 독특한 음색 성격 등 여러가지가 어우러져 난잡함이 아닌 대단한 조화를 이루어서 정말 좋아하는 그룹중 하나
=
_i didn’t even realise solar slipped until I came back to watch this video for the 19th time this week_
=
Im a real girl but moonbyul is just can you stop
=
늘 보면 맘무는 핸드마이크만 씀 인이어 (핀)마이크를 쓴 걸 본적이 없음..
=
The main reason I started watching Queendom is Bom. Now, I just don't know. Mamamoo really knows how to give a killer performance!
=
I genuinely don’t think that was Jimin’s real reaction to Solar referencing her UP bars. Looks like a poor edit lol.
=
솔라 센터에서 당황했을텐데 자연스럽게 웃으면서 하는게 대단하다..
=
와 용선언니 랩은 생각도 못했다 날 가져요 내 용돈 다 줄게
=
마마무 라이브하면서 이정도 무대를 하다니 ... 진짜 팬인게 자랑스럽다
=
솔라 진짜... 솔라이쁘다 ㄷㄷ
=
1:52 Solar's part was my favourite 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 I want a whole song of this version 🛐 I want to fly to South Korea and spent all my money on Mamamoo concerts 🥰🥰🥰💖💖💖💖
=
화사멋있다
=
1:26 진짜 심장을 저격했습니다 문별언니! ㅠㅠ
=
이거 원래 마마무 노래죠?
=
아 언니들 몇 년만 기다려..수능 치고 재입덕 알바비 덕질에 다 꼬라박는다..
=
와 남에 노래를 이렇게 가지고 놀아도 됩니까?ㅎㅎㅎ 
이 퀸덤 이란 프로에 나오는 팀들중에 마마무와 여자아이들 대결이 될듯 ㅋ
두팀은 실력vs실력, 컨셉vs컨셉 서로가 어느 하나 쳐지지 않는다 ㅋ
=
왜 문별언급은 안보여ㅠ 내기준 문별 진짜 랩 원탑이야ㅠㅠ😍😍
=
Wheein’s entrance blow my wig away
=
그냥 콘서트를 만들어버리는 레벨. 퀸덤 마마무 검색하로 감.
=
This is my favourite out of all the stages in the second round. This is what I call sexy but not dirty. I've seen so many idols (group or solo) try so hard to be sexy but just end up looking so "dirty" and not in a pleasant way. But this, this is a good mix of class + sexy + confidence + badass and I love it so much.
=
The power in hwasa’s voice
=
I love how AOA also appreciate them and smiles sweetly
Love to see groups being friendly to each other even in a competition <3
Plz also give support to the original song :)) but this cover is lit
=
화사 스타일 너무 좋은데 비트도 ㅁㅊㄷ
=
4:29 my favorite part
=
Mis reinas MAMAMOO 👏👏👏🙌💪✊👊 son las mejores chicas!!!
=
are we supposed to survive this? Cause I died after the first 2 seconds
=
Moonbyul freaking murdered my soul😭💕
=
딱 마마무 처럼 바꿧네요
랩도 만들공ㅠㅠ
마마무 사랑해여ㅠㅠ❤❤
=
While I like other groups' performance, it is without a shadow of a doubt that Mamamoo totally slayed everyone in this stage of the competition.
=
별아...진짜 문별......별아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ죽여줘...제발....화사받고 문스타 뙇 나올 때 죽는 줄  알았어...
=
마마무는 진짜 그냥 즐기는거같다... 즐기는 게 진짜 눈에 보이네요ㅠㅠ
=
1:59 인형
=
구욱럭!! 길이길이 이부분 개좋아 발음 완전 내 스타일
=
1:20 OPPA MOONBYUL!!! 💖
=
RAINHASSS🇧🇷❤️
=
마마무 보는 내 맘 대변 1:21
=
can we appreciate that mamamoo made one song sound like four different genres yet it all still sounded united as one
=
I never know that Mamamoo and AOA cover each other songs is something that i need in my life 😱

P.S: Hwasa and Kei are the same age. Just a kind reminder 😁
=
마마무 너무 좋다 ㅜㅜㅠㅜ
=
Concert feeling
#reallygoodluck
=
0:51 멈추면
=
Moonbyul oppa wkwk <3
=
Wahhh moonbyullll😍💕
=
노래 듣다보면 아이스크림 계의 메가톤바 같음
=
oh my god i'm gay
=
대박 마마무 완벽해요 😘 😍 😍 😍
=
휘인💕💕
=
문별 미쳤당♡♡♡♡언니 날가져가여♡♡
=
Wheein and Moonbyul thoughhhh 😭😍
=
와 문별 랩 미쳤네..
=
my thousand time here kjdbhdjnjnd this is so good
=
Kei literally said the same thing as I did😱💙😂 it really did feel like their own concert
=
moonbyul 😍😍😍
=
look carefully and you'll see Soyeon almost laugh when Solar slipped. or am i wrong?
=
다 필요없고 마마무는 존나 멋있다
=
Moonbyul quenn😍
=
문별 입장하는 부분 더보고깊다
=
Yass Moonstar get them linessss!!! Best rapper
=
The best performance in queendom 😍😍😍
=
I really like this “mess”. It’s so powerful and I’m focused the whole time, it’s so much fun!
=
OKAY BUT MOONBYUL SHUT UPPPPPPPPPPPP  1:15
=
There stage presence on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
=
They are too good for this competition though.
=
컨셉도 다양하고 노래도 잘 하고 걍 진짜 무슨 콘서트 보는 것 같아 대박
=
와 진짜 열심히 준비한 티 진짜 많이난다....휘인 아프다던데 괜찮나ㅜㅜㅜㅜ솔라 발목 괜찮으려나ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ네개의 다른 컨셉이라니 진짜 대박이다...노래도 너무 잘하고....랩도 찰지고....마마무 수고했어요!!!!
=
5:14 "I like me" - Hwasa


Mood.
=
솔라도 대단한 것 같음 처음 나올때 저음으로 해서 깜짝 놀람,,,그러다가 후반부 고음ㄷㄷ
=
탈빠 말려지네요
=
믿듣믿보마마무 넘사벽 ,,, 진짜 최고다 여기가 마마무 단독콘서트 무대 영상이 있는 곳인가요? 엄청나다 그냥 원래부터 본인들 노래였던 것처럼 부름 ㄷㄷ
=
아 도입부 화사파트 너무 좋다ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ멋있어서 치여
=
화사 첫부분 존나 개 멋있엌ㅋㅋ ㅠㅠㅠ
=
실력 자체가 좀 다름... 백댄서로 화려한것도 좋지만 얘네는 자체가 다 잘하는데 또 멤버별로 다 다르게 매력있어
=
섹시하고 노출많은옷 입힐거면 이렇게 찰떡인 분들한테 입히든가, 성인 채 되지도 않은 여자애들한테 천쪼가리 몇개 입혀놓고 춤춰보라하니까 저런 폼이 안나지ㅡ
=
나는 마마무 한 그룹을 파는게 아니라
문별 솔라 휘인 화사 4그룹을 파고있었어 미친 개좋네
=
*They even sang it live, the heck, they're slaying the stage so hard, I STAN TALENTED QUEENS*
=
THEY SNAPPED HARD ASF
=
I'm crying and dying watching this. Our girls are born to be the Stage!!!
Sooooo proud of being a moo moo.
Hope Yonsong unnie didn't injure her ankle :(
=
Tangina. Yun lng nasabi ko. Wala na. Gay forever nako. lalo kay Moonbyul. Ugh. 🤣🤣🤣
=
아 편집너무 이상하게했어.. 편집 자연스럽게 못할 실력이면 그냥 무대만 보여줘
=
I am not their fans. But this perfomance, o my god.. so strong
=
QUEENS QUEENS QUEENS
=
와 진짜... 사람들이 왜 마마무 마마무 하는지알겠다
=
Mamamoo is that group that each member have overwhelming charisma, but one of them never outshines others they just blend perfectly. They really are a GROUP. It's make me sad when I see a group who have one member that pushed so much by the agency, even if they image truly like that. I mean Hwasa is like that, but when she perform as a group they blend each other perfectly, it's just show amazing their teamwork in my eyes
=
용선이 언니 중간에 발 삐었는데도 당황하지 않고 다시 아무일 없던것처럼 해주신거 멋져용 ><😘
=
*MAMAMOO!! YOU BETTER EDUCATE THE GIRLS HOW TO PUT UP A PERFORMANCE!!!!!*
=
Ok but not enough people are talking about Solars performance like damnnn
=
도입부 화사 오진다 ㄹㅇ;
=
와 화사 진짜 무대 개잘하네 목소리까지 개좋아
=
I love Mamamoo😍😍😍
=
You can't deny that mamamoo is one of the best groups out there
=
Twice is in the ads then Mamamoo in the video, ok I'm full😍😍😍😍
=
마마무만 라이브네 다른 그룹은 왜 보정하는거야  암넷아
=
아 진짜 솔라언니 의상 시러 ㅜ
=
방송으로 보는거랑 현장체감은 많이 다를수밖에. 영상으론 별로일수있어도 현장에서 박봄이나 마마무나 다 무대사운드가 다름.
=
this was the best performance in my opinion
=
The luckiest piano on the planet.
=
2:08 2:08 2:08 2:08 2:08 2:08 2:08 2:08
=
화사 무대 진짜 독보적이다...
=
휘인 무대 연습 20분하고 한 거라는데 졸라 잘해 진짜...ㅠㅠ
=
마마무는 실력빵꾸가 없어서 너무 좋음 .  분위기가 깨지지않고 쭉 이어가서 장점이 강한 그룹. 실력이 다 좋으니 모든 컨셉이 어울릴 수 밖에. 편곡도 항상 곡에 대한 정서를 이어나가서 거부감이 없지만 마마무의 컨셉이 보이기 쉬웠음. 뭐?  무튼 마마무 쨩
=
“It’s like a concert”, yeah, all of MAMAMOO’s performances seem like concerts 😂 they’re so comfortable on stage. It really shows their professionalism
=
마직막 팅- 촥 하는거 개간지
=
화사 진짜 대박임ㅠㅠ 이렇게 무대 잘하는지 몰랐다ㅠ ㄹㅇ 화사밖에 안보인다
=
4:29 화사사랑해
=
화사 진짜 대박이구나...............
=
화사 춤출때 0:54 여기 보는 내표정이랑 똑같아서 현웃ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋ
=
진짜 각 멤버의 캐릭터를 의상에서 잘 녹여냈구나...
화사는 섹시하고 개간지 쩌는 카리스마를 진짜 깝치다가 맞아 죽을 것 같은 이미지로 마치 갱스터 마냥 강하게 표현했고
문별은 톰보이 느낌으로 시원시원한 느낌을 남돌의상 같은걸 입혀놔서 더 돝보이게 했네
솔라도 이제 "예쁜이중엔 내가 제일 예뻐" 라는 느낌의 당당하고 장난스러운, 그러나 사랑할 수 밖에 없는 도발적인 여자 느낌을 잘 표현했고
휘인도 역시 섹시하고 유혹적인 모습과 함께 그 흘러나오는 예쁨과 우아함을 잘 표현 한 것 같음.

진짜 각 구역에서 탑 먹고 온 사람들이 모여서 무대한 것 같았다... 마마무 대박
=
역시 마마무인가....

화사는 다른댓글들 보고오면 그댓들이 내 마음 대변해줌 그러니 길게 쓸 필요가없지 ㅠㅠ혜지니 무대 아우라 미치도록 독보적인건 대부분 다 아는 사실인걸...  문별 진짜 랩으로 보는사람마음 제대로찢었다...어쩜저리 랩을 멋있게 잘한담...문햄찌 보이쉬매력 진짜 돌았음. 저 꿀떨어지는 목소리로 보컬하는거 듣고싶다. 이거보고 구차해 들으러갑니다. 심지어 우리엄마피셜 진짜 문별은 멋지게 랩을 잘하드라ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ솔라는 브로드웨이의 백조같다...아니 그보다더해ㅠㅠㅠㅠ의자 걷어차버리고 내 얼굴급으로 큰 리본 던질때 섹시속에 카리스마까지 터짐 ㅠㅠ이런 느낌주는 컨셉은 처음겪어봐서 너무 새로운느낌으로 맴찢당함 ㅠㅠ 고음은 들을때마다 활명수 오조오억병 마신기분임ㅠㅠ휘인 카메라로 왜캐안잡아주냐... 피아노에 깔리는 저 감성적이고 아름다운 진짜 이름처럼 바람같은 휘인 그자체의 목소리...딩고뮤직 세로라이브 윈드플라워  휘인목소리에 제대로 입덕했는데  만약 내귀에 결석이있었더라면 휘인목소리들으면 그 결석 다 녹아 사라질꺼같다...ㅠㅠ 휘인 춤은 유튭에 따로 검색해볼정도로 좋아하는데 이 요망한카메라맨분이 휘니 너무안잡아줘 ㅠㅠ 휘니 춤 젤 조아한다고!!!
장황하게도 쓴거같지만 마마무 칭찬은 이정도로는 부족합니다. 
오늘도 일용할 멋진음악을 해주셔서 감사합니다 무멘...
=
아 진짜 솔라부분환장하게 좋다ㅜㅠㅜㅜ 내가제일예쁘고무해해요 하는데 사실 존나치명적인독인 컨셉ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 너무 브로드웨이 무대같고 개좋다 환장하게 좋아서 거기만 다섯번돌려봄ㅠㅠ
=
god Solar ! god Kim Yongsun !
=
무대장인 갓마무;; 미쳤다 진짜😭❤
=
GOSH WHEEIN STAPH
=
그냥 개인 콘서트 보는 느낌이야 초반에 각각 파트 나눠서 혼자 하는거 보면 각자의 개성을 살리기 위해 노력한거 같네요 역시 마마무 실망시키지 않는 그룹으로 소문난 만큼 기대이상이네요 ㅎ
=
와 멤버 하나하나 개쩐다.. 미친 진짜 대박이야
=
THIS IS WHY MAMAMOO ARE MY BIAS GIRL GROUP SLAYYYYYY SISTERS
=
OMG!!
=
1:30 *Unpretty Rapstar theme plays*
=
3:55 설현 미소만 남아 ㅠ
=
미쳐서 한다는게 이런거구나 진심 즐기고 있다는게 보인다. 라이브
=
ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
this was AMAZING!! loved every second of this performance!!!!! as always Mamamoo slaying the stage.
=
THEY ARE SO TALENTEDDDDD
=
솔라하고 화사하고 누가 메인이냐 ?

=
AAAHHHH
=
미친.... 개쩐다
=
Unbelievable
=
프로다 마마무 멋있어 언니들 최고야
=
솔라 댓글은 없네.
참 솔라도 진짜 이뻤는데
=
ㅇ아ㅏ아앙 너무 조아~
=
3:25 잘생겼어...!!ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
4:39 이 장면 너무 좋다
=
진심 이 무대는 먼저 고혹적인 화사가 문열어서 존나 멋있게  찢고 다음 문스타가 엄청 멋있게 랩하면서 존나 심장 폭행하면서 후에 솔라한테 가서 솔라 미모랑 보컬 몸매 춤으로 끝난 후에 끼부리는 우리 휘인이를 마지막으로 완전 여유 넘치게 춤추면서 음정 완벽한 보컬로 끝장냄...ㄷㄷ 역시 맘무♥
=
Daeeeebaaakkkk!!! You want too kill me, dont you, mamamoo!!!?? This's like a concert! I'm sureeee
=
화사 칭찬 되게 많은데 난 개인적으로 문별 휘인 너무 존예..ㅠㅠㅠ
=
갠적으로 4명 같이 노래부르는게 좋다 뭔가 화음처럼 ^^
=
마마무가 가창력만 있는게 아니다 라고 보여준 무대였네요. 말그대로 무대 찢어놈..
=
omg I got so scared when Solar almost slipped. my heart almost dropped😭
=
When you look at boom's eye, she kinda longing to perform as group
=
she slipped to let us all know they ain't doin any lip sync, queens i tell u, QUEENSSSSS
=
콘서트야?
=
Solar finally got the size of the bow she wanted
=
唱功绝了
=
화사 머리에 빨간스타킹 시롸??!
=
화사 진짜 클라스가 다르네 무대 장악력 예술이다 와..
=
C H I L L
=
진짜 콘서트... 멍청이 - 문무비- 빅부리 - 모데라토... 최고다
=
Hwasa is a diva.
=
Maknae hwasa on top
=
I kinda hate it when they dont finish wheein's performance like DUDES SHE HAS A LAST SAY. WHY DO WE HAVE TO WATCH IT FROM AFAR.
=
퍼포먼스는 얘들이 진짜 탑이다 ㅇㅈ 함 
근데 가끔 너무 과한 거만 빼면 딱 좋음 너무 한꺼번에 많은 걸 보여줄라고 하다 보니 .. 힘 약간 만 빼고 전체적인 흐름에 집중하면 전반적으로 더 나을 듯
=
솔라  징짜 화들짝 ㅜㅜㅜ 안넘어진거 다행이가. ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 근데 시발 전나 좋다 화사 미쳤고 언니들 나 지금 신나서 궁딩이 흔들고 이써,, 마마무언냐들 사랑해..
=
OHMYGOODNEEEEEES THEY JUST SLAYED ME SO HARD SPECIALLY MY BABY SOLAR
=
WHEEIN?????
=
역시 갓마마무 내년에도 뵈었으면 좋겠어요
=
Hwasa back dancer look so much like her 😳
=
necesito ver esots videos subtitulados en español o ingles ;(((((((((
=
1:20 That´s it, I´m bi now.
=
화사 노랜데????
=
마마무 나로말할것같으면 할 때도 확 느낀 건데 어떻게 멤버들 하나하나 다 저렇게 개성이 넘치고 색깔이 뚜렷하지? 그런데도 그룹 안에서 아무도 튄다거나 안 어울리는 느낌 없이 조화로움... 진짜 신인때부터 한결같이 독보적인 그룹
=
진짜 마마무 팬이지만 팬심빼고 봐도 너무 멋있다
개개인만의 느낌도 잘 살리고
무료콘서트 보는 느낌
=
괜히 마마무하는게 아니야 라이브 외모 춤 안되는게 뭐냐 이러니깐 마마무 하는거지
=
문별언니 멋져요ㅜㅜㅜ❤️❤️
=
Even their concept is a little bit off... but i like the idea that they got to be a center of attention equally.
=
Really?? Why isn't anyone talking about Solar's slappin that booty at 4:16? That was so damn gay
=
솔직히 마마무 실력으로 깔 사람 없을 듯
=
이때동안 끼참느라 수고했다 맘무
=
MY GOD
=
재능이 저런 것을 뜻하는구나...
=
나만..겁나좋았나...? 한명씩 한명씩 다른 스타일로 등장할때마다 헐 다음은 무슨 스타일일까 기대하면서 봤는데ㅎㅎ;; 마마무 실력이 좋아서 긍가 각기 다른 재료 모아서 하나의 맛난 음식을 만들어낸 느낌이였는뎅.. 생각보다 중구난방이라는 평이 많아서 당황 경연에 맞춰서 화려하고 좋지않았나?ㅠ 머 개인취향은 다 다른거니께 근데 난 너무 좋았다 진짜좋았다... +솔라파트에 지민랩 넣은건 그냥 aoa곡이라서 넣어준듯?
=
Moonbyul - male sexy
Hwasa - 💅
Wheein - sexy
Solar - cute
=
내가 만약에 박봄이었으면 마마무 무대보고 2ne1 때 생각났을 것 같음...
=
Carregaram o programa nas costas puts rs
=
생각해보니까 저기 나오시는 가수분들 박봄님이면 엄청 대 선배일텐데 박봄님 시점으로보면 진짜 후배분들 귀엽게 보시겠다 비유하자면 부모님이 어린이집 재롱잔치간 느낌으로 귀엽게 보실듯 (그것보다 진짜 잘하시는거같아 원래 느끼고 있었지만,,,)
=
Let's aim for 2 mil in one day. We can do it
=
Omaigad!!
=
Essa menina aparece de todos os cantos eu escutei um barulho aqui em casa levei um susto achando que era mamamoo atrás de mim
=
Is this morning physical cultivating ?!
=
I'm not even their fan before but now I am and I really want to go to their concert
=
Hwasa makes me tremble, omg. She's such a goddess
=
마마무는 멤버들 다 솔로여도 멋진 무대 만들지만
4명이 같이 있으니까 진짜 너무 멋지다 그리고 화사의 입술 올리는 표정 너무 좋음
=
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
=
wow !!!
=
MNET SNAKES, PAY THE PERFORMERS ON YOUR SHOW AND COVER THEIR PRODUCTION COSTS.
None of these groups should need to pay for the performances that are earning YOU so much money.
=
ive never heard these songs so it all sounds like a new mamamoo bop to me and im lovin it
=
화사 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ산적닮음
=
💜💜💜💜💜💜
=
Please, Mamamoo, record a second version of this cover based on Hwasa’s part. kkk It's perfect.
=
5:12 
Tbh if I was Hwasa I would like myself as well 👀😂
=
아니 세상에 마마무 미친거 아닙니까.. 3:47 여기서 솔라에서 화사로 넘어가는데 목소리에 침식당함...ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 흐루흐루루ㅠㅜㅠㅠ 이거 며칠 전에 보고 또 생각나서 보러왔어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
화사되게 초록색 이랑 빨간색 좀 잘받는거같음
=
처음엔 솔라가 이쁘고 노래를 잘해서 마마무 좋아했는데 휘인이 매력적이게 보이고 문스타가 랩을 넘나 잘해서 빠지고 화사는 진짜 멋잇다는 말밖엔.... 
마마무가 노래부르다 틀려도 아무도 모를듯 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
아이돌중에서 이렇게 차별되는 사람없는듯... 화사(님) 예능보다가 이거보면
화사(님)맞아??이렇게 생각하게 되네...!
마마무(님) 자체가 보컬로는 말할것도 없고.. 춤도..예능도...뭐가 부족하지...???
=
이 무대는 진짜 퀸사 하드캐리... 퀸사 혼자 커버해도 무대가 꽉 찼을 것 같음. 맨날 화사 외모 욕하는 남초커뮤에서도 퀸사 무대 하나는 끝장난다는 말 할 정도면 다 했다 ㅠㅠ
=
I married of Mamamoo😍😍😍😍😍 I love the best Groupe
=
I need a cover pleeeeessssss
=
Moony rap👌🏻
=
Daebaaaaaak 😍😍😍
=
I need a cover

휘인진짜이쁘네...
=
DAAAAAAAMMMMMNNNNNNNN!!!!!! MY GIRLS ARE SUPER GIRLS!!!!!
=
Moonbyul daddyyyyyyyy 🙈🙈🙈🙈❤❤❤❤
=
1:21 the fan girl had a gay panic when Moonbyul appeared 😂
=
1일 1영상 실천중 ..😻
=
minha performance favorita dessa segunda fase, apesar de todos os outros grupos terem arrasado também eu continuei amando essa <3 minha torcida está para o Mamammo!
=
Hwasa Queeen i need Cover
=
3:19 최애타임
=
1:22 is me when I saw Mamamoo for the first time.
=
Lol why jimin look so pissed off
=
Woooooooooooow 💃💃💃💃👍👍
=
마마무 같은 그룹은 절대 다시는 못 나올 거 같다 진심 개성이 살아있는데 목소리도 각각의 컨셉이 잘 섞여들음
=
When solar did Jimins rap from Unpretty Rap Star...THATS OUR SOLARRRR
=
맨 처음 화사부분 제일조음
=
They just did Good luck in 4 Colors. definitely Mamamoo style. 


I believe AOA's Good Luck was the least popular among their albums. Mamamoo might just bring it back to top chart.
=
존나멋있다 이말밖에 안나옴...솔라 나올때 진짜 다른노랜줄알고 다시 돌려봄... ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ여팬 많은이유 너무잘알겠다미친다와ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 가창력 무대장악력 퍼포먼스 컨셉 편곡 무대구성 외모 의상 어느것 하나 빠짐이 없었다...🤭....❤️
=
4:56 soyeon's reaction is me
=
원곡 aoa good luck 노래자체가 들어보면 계속 반복적이라서 백댄서써서 춤추고노래만하면 자칫 지루해질수있는데. 이렇게 색다르게 재밋게 꾸민거 난 괜찮은데 ? 영상으로 보면 별로일수있어도 현장에선 콘서트처럼 좋을듯
=
개인적으로 다 좋지만 혜진이 도입부가 너무 좋음.. 완전 찰떡쓰
=
When Solar did Jimin's rap from Unpretty Rapstar I'm died jdjdjdj
=
약간 다른팀은 탕수육 하나를 만들기위해서 힘을 합치는 느낌인데 마마무는 누구는 짜장 누구는 짬뽕 이런식으로 다 다른거 먹고싶어서 각자 소량씩 만들어온다음 한접시에 담은 느낌임 근데 그 한접시가 각양각색에 맛도 좋아서 넘 완벽함.
=
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
=
But like. Isnt their concept one? Like their concept is early 19s where mafia and stuff is still ongoing?
=
The fact that every member got to show their abilities to kill us moomoo in each of their part is perfect
=
섹시를 다양하게 보여줘서 좋은듯 섹시 하면 떠오르는 대표적  이미지가  있고 솔직히 성상품화다 뭐다 말많지만 입고 보여지는 본인이 만족하고 정말 좋아하는가?가 중요한것같다.예를 들어 성상품화다 말많은 의상입은 솔라나 휘인을 봤을때 왜인지 그런생각이 별로안들음 무대나 컨셉 ,본인이 원한 의도가 보여서 그런것같다.두서없이 얘기했지만 개성이 성에 매여있지 않다는 것과 다름을 받아들이는 것을 강조하는 지금 섹시가 여러가지가 있고 부정인 생각 없이 본 좋은 무대같다.
=
who wants Mamamoo world tour?
=
SOY LA ÚNICA QUE SE QUEDA CÓMO BOLUDA CUANDO VE A MOONBYUL SBIDKEKEKR LA AMO AAA
=
더~ 자신있궤! 넘 좋앙
=
I think solar slipped on my wig
=
3:33 Soyeon be like: YES!
=
Too many tricks, they should save some idea to the following stage.
=
ฮวาซา = ยังโอม
=
엠넷 특 실수한 거 n번 반복해서 보여줌.
=
Why does byul feel the need to wreck me over and over again
=
Mi bb solar😥❤
=
他より再生数少ないの謎すぎる
=
OMG
=
OMG
=
이틀연속 콘서트한 우리 맘무언니들 맞나요 .. 밥대신 홍삼산삼 갈아드시나 ㅠㅠ 이때 휘인 아플땐데 멀쩡하다고 깜빡 속을뻔 이노래는 무덤에 들어갈때 이어폰꽂고 누울거임  ...
=
이 언니들은 무대에서 그냥 노는데 장악까지 하네 ㅠ 마마무 사랑해 ,,,
=
moonbyul did it for the lesbians
=
QUEENS
=
화사가 무대 잘한다는 말이 괜히 나오는 게 아님 진짜 화사밖에 안보인다
=
Oh.. Free concert there.. I'm blessed
=
I want to be the floor they step on. Please.
=
Some parts of this performance strangely match kokobop 😅
=
Ok no wonder they won
=
ARTE¡!!!!¡¡¡
=
Just want to let you guys Mamamoo just pull 80% on this performance, they havent show Solar poll or even Hwasa's legendary clothes. Eventually they already pull out Moonbyul 'chained guys' on this performance. Welp same like Wheein, (btw I love her long hair I cant event talk about it) Overall, mamamoo talents doesnt have an ending. They can pull of so much genre in the next episode.
=
MAMAMOO SUPREMAS
=
momoos
=
노래는 알겠는데 누구 노래죠? 와 역시 마마무
=
Park bom è sconcertata
=
este performance fue demasiado aasiodjoiasjdoijsaoijas

노래이름을모르겠어
=
solAR s T O P iT adfshnfvbslhefbavekn
=
Each of them are amazing ❣️
=
마마무는 항상 한 그룹 안에서 다양한 여성상을 보여주는 듯함..
마마무는 항상 자신들이 하고 싶은 걸 당당하게 하니까 너무 좋아!
=
Goddess
=
4:06 Mamamoo's lead vocal just sang the part of AOA' s lead rapper. What are you trying to say, ma'am?
=
What`s Up? 03:41 Solar figthing¡
=
화사 개좋아!!!♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
their energy and talent is just on another level
=
WOWWWWWW I LOVE THEM SO MUCH
=
THAT SOLAR BOOB POP WAS UNEXPECTED YES QUEEN
=
ㅋ
=
I love that they gave a nod to Jimin's Puss in there I haven't heard that rap in so long also found it funny when all of AOA turned to look at her at that part lol
=
Why Mamamoo only one perfomance? (G)idle Bom and Aoa 2 perfomances and presentation:c need more this girls
=
0:32 what happened to her nose :((
=
"How many wigs, gay souls, ovaries are you gonna snatch in this performance?"

Mamamoo: "YES."
=
i c o n i c
=
👑Queen  👑
=
西芳族。西方族
=
Oh ma gawd did solar just say that she's the top madam? I am shoook.
=
This is originality at its best. Making a whole song and stage their own that you can't even recognise the original is artistry defined. Goddamn
=
솔직히 난 이런 느낌이 들었음

그래, 우리 예쁘고 섹시해.
보고 싶으면 맘대로 봐, 어차피 닳는 것도 아닌데ㅋㅋ
근데 어쩌냐, 우린 노래도 ㅈ나 잘하는데ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

이런 느낌?ㅋㅋㅋ
=
와 편곡이랑 무대 구성 진짜 잘했다.한명씩 다 다른 스타일로 무대하는건 상상도 못했는데
=
they even incorporated some rap from unpretty ;p
=
hwasaaaaaa. ..ughhhh
=
This performance is almost reaching the highest level! I can't believe this song is from AOA. It's almost a new song!
=
2:09 어허...그러면 앙대~
=
*I'm so gay for Minhyuk oh sorry for Xiumin again sorry for Moonbyul* 😂
=
crazy fans 3:22
=
1:51 4:09 ????
=
Lol they owned the song! is this really a cover? 😂dear stage floor, no trippin our solarshido aight?
=
With that look, Hwasa is two seconds away from drawing a gun and saying: "give me your wallet, punk!" :)
=
Am i crazy or is hwasa actually wearing a durag??
=
Did mnet really have to interrupt and repeat all those parts? I really didn't like the editing, they added a whole minute to mamamoo's performance. Why didn't they do it to other groups?
=
화사파트 저음인게 뭔가 다르게 섹시하다
=
마마무 너무양보함 계속 첫무대만 해ㅠㅠ 뒷무대좀했으면 ㅠㅠ
=
미친건가 이거 마마무노랜가.. 진짜 박봄 말 개공감.. 작정했네.. 레전드다 와 무대를 뒤집어 놓으셨다 마마무님들
=
04:07 *FUN FACT:*
The reason why all AOA members looked at Jimin and Jimin went "bitch, whaaaat?" is because Solar rapped Jimin's UPRS winning song "Puss". Mamamoo really studied their homework well 😂😂
=
아 근데 편집이 같은장면이 너무많이 반복된다...
=
솔라 발목 괜찮은건가ㅠㅠ
=
진짜 멋있다 곡에 전부 컨셉을 통일한게아니라 각자에게 맞는 옷과 퍼포먼스들.... 진짜 무대를 즐기는게 보여서 보는 내가 행복해지네 ㅠㅠ
=
hwasa😭
=
2:08 서랍장 정리 스킬;;
=
thee bestttt!!!!
=
do they have lyk a clean version of this performance?? w/o backstage reaction??? this is sooo fcking gooodd i wanna enjoy itt
=
리액션시간(방송분-풀버전): 마마무(1분5초), aoa(7초), 박봄(4초), 오마이걸(11초), 여자이이들(13초), 러블리즈(15초). 
아놔 마마무 리액션시간이 나머지 5팀 리액션 시간 총합보다 길어요. 
왜 그러지 엠넷
=
와.....짱이다...

=
圧倒的女王感(゜o゜;
=
아 진짜 마마무는 멤버별로 컨셉들이 너무 좋다 안겹치고... 잘 소화하고....
마마무 무대는 의상컨셉, 헤어스탈, 메이크업 보는맛에도 보는것 같음ㅜㅜ
=
0:18 4:28

마마무는 어딜봐도 실력파
=
박봄만안나왔음딱인데

=
moonbyul making me question my sanity
=

=
Sad knetz disliking this video because they can't handle confident and sexy ladies putting on a charismatic performance 🙄🙄🙄
=
제발 화사버전 으류 완곡한거 듣고싶다....
=
마:마법갑은 무데..
마:마마무 사랑하욥!
무:무무들보고 쓰러진다..(깨꼬닥..(?))
솔직히
솔라:음색진짜 섹시함..너무박력있고..아니걸그러쉬하다고 해야하나?아무튼
화사:진짜 화사답게 잘함 처음에 화사님께 별로 감점 않가졌는데 화사,솔라,문별,휘인진짜 입덕 했음..
휘인:휘인님 진짜 행동 섹씨함..진짜 남성분과 합게하시는데 진짜 너무 예쁨...
문별:랩보고 진짜 감탄함 멋짐..
마마무 사랑해욥!💕
=
난 마마무 무대는 다 좋지만 제일 좋은 게 라이브 하고 있다는 게 딱 티가 나서 좋아 다른 무대들도 좋지만 보정을 해서 그런가 이게 라이브를 하고 있는지 잘 모르겠는데 마마무는 누가 들어도 라이브 중이구나 알 수 있어서 좋음
=
Mamamoo is just perfect  k girl Group...
=
1:51 랑 4:10 똑같은거 같은데 아닌가요..? ((?
=
매력 쩌네 ....❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
마마무 라이브 인증 되었네요 ㅋㅋ 실수를 통해서
=
All is ok, they was excelent but I need to say that they had a error and this is a competition so the other groups have more advantage
=
와~ 솔라 랩 언프때 지민이 했던 랩 아닌가? 진짜 무대 잘 했다~
=
so we're just gonna ignore how amazing wheein was in this?

i know everyone is talking about hwasa but i swear i’m so gay for solar

Solars dress look like LE dress

Their reaction after wheein appeared they were like "how can a puppy be this sexy"
=
Mamamoo made their own I Got A Boy iconic!
=
Wow
=
Amazing how Jimin does the same shocked/*lowkey* insulted expression at 1:51 and 4:09
=
Me during the whole performance 1:21
=
I don't know why but everytime i keep repeating this video because im  fricking GAY for them and then see Solar had slipped. My lifespan just keeps getting shorter and shorter, because of both...Im GAY AS HELL FOR THEM and idk why but it hurt me when she slipped. Shes okay tho so i  confuse myself
=
Queens 👑 always carrying!
=
갠적으로는 구성이 화려하고 각 멤버를통해 마마무의 다양한 모습을 보여줬다 라는 것이 새롭긴했지만
특별한 임팩트가 있어서 계속 생각나는 무대는아닌듯..
다채롭다.화려하다.이지 조화롭고 기억에 남는무대는 아니었던.
=
im gay now
=
솔라 당황하지 않고 바로 노래 이어가는거봐 리스펙....

Hwasa queeeeen
=
moonbyul flaca te ama
=
Noone:

Every single Moomoo when they see mamamoo: 1:21
=
Putangina byul mamatai ako dadi
=
으어 진짜 너무 멋있어 다른 팀 곡으로 마마무 콘서트를 해버리네
=
휘인 춤 ㅈㄴ 잘춘다 진짜 이반에 퍼포먼스 휘인이 했다면 어떤식으로 했을까라는 상상 오지게 함
=
I wanted to see the more of the other groups reaction to moonbyul rap
=
AOA 반응 나만 띠껍나
=
Mamamoo is a great performer and divide their parts equally that everyone shines. So amazing
=
Hwasa definitely born to be on the stage. She is literally just so amazing.
=
marry me moonbyul!!!
=
5:00에 솔라가 고음지르고 여유롭게 웃는거보고 치임..
=
Tell me they won cause if they didnt thats unfair
=
Mamamoo brought life to this boring hell song from AOA. LOL <3
=
박봄 중간 표정이 뭔가 아련해보이는게... 저렇게 재밌게 그룹활동했던 옛날을 그리워하지 않았을까..
=
Wawwwww 😬😬😳👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
=
2:40 설현 제일 이쁘다 ㄷ ㄷ
=
a quien puede no gustarle !!!!! las amo !!!
=
03:37 im living for Hyejeong supporting Solar ♡
=
Wow
=
Queens👑👑👑
=
2:08초 좀..
=
4:06 solars rap omg
=
Actually this is what Mamamoo ALWAYS does in their concerts 😌 As Momos we are so LUCKY that we can often see their stage full of pasion and art. If you feel interested in them, pls take time watching their Immortal stage or their Concert Performances ❤️
Mamamoo never stay the same, but also never lose their individual identity. Even just in this stage you can see :
Solar is the mixture of sexiness and cutiness,
Hwasa sexy like a Gangster,
Wheein sexy and femini,
And Buyl is kind of bisexual attractive.

Let me introduce to you: Moomoo’s mama - MAMAMOO 😁🤣
=
마마무님들 진짜 노래도 완벽하고 퍼포먼스도 완벽한데 의상이 항상 아쉬움...촌스럽다고 해야하나.. 2프로 부족한 느낌.
스타일링만 세련되게해도 훨씬 멋있을거 같은데 아쉽습니다.
=
SOLAR IS A PROFESSIONAL QUEEN
=
후반부에 다같이 일렬로 서서 안무안하고 노래부를때 너무 좋다
=
THAT’S MY QUEENS!!!!
=
근데 커버긴 하지만 너무 원곡 느낌 안나서 좀 아쉽다 ㅠㅠ
=
Mamamoo came to slay not play
=
I love her 1:54
my honey my queen ♥️♥️💕💕
=
I'm killed because Hwasa 😱🔥
=
Hwasa is really really best! She is so powerful, talented and sexy🔥 MY QUEEN
=
무슨 화사는....ㅋㅋㅋㅋ TLC무대 보는줄 알았어 ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ
=
에이오에이 마마무 무대가 진짜 잘 맞춰진듯..😻😻
=
화사 너무 귀여워 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
미친 처음 화사 할때 마마무 노래로 착갔했다
=
MY STARS 💫💫💫💫
=
oh my this is so good
=
1.2차처럼 순서 첫번째로 해도 안잊혀질듯...그래도 3차경연은 좀 뒷무대했음 좋겠다ㅜㅜ
=
Never fail to shock me
=
aoa입장에서도 후배가 저만큼 노래나 무대컨셉 공부하고 노력해서 새로운 무대보여준거 되게 고마울거 같다.
=
Umm whoa 💓
=
진짜멋져
=
입이 떡 버러진다 ..마마무 답다
=
❤️❤️
=
واااااااو💥💥💥💥🔥💕
=
Slayed!!!
=
역쉬 마마무 모든 노래를 살려
=
원곡이 낫다
=
Hwasa sang I like you twice
=
I waited a lot of days to find a comment about the girl screaming at Moonbyul part :(((( Still waiting
=
شنو هالابداع نعلله
=
3:25
엉엉ㅠㅜ
=
can't get over this "drop beat" voice in hwasa's Performance b4 she gets down
=
I want to see loco reacting to this boi once again fell for hwasa charm
=
I didn't notice my mouth was openㅋㅋㅋ
=

=

=
4:57

=

=
라이브 쩐다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 와 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
👑👑 MY   QUEENS 👑👑
=
마마무피아노맨때부터 좋아하는데
문별은 마마무노래에 랩할땐좋은데
그외에 랩하는건 별로야... 진부함
다양하게 랩했으면함 ㅠ_ㅠ
=
Mamamoo owned the Song so well like its ther Original Version 😍 I hope their version is available on Spotify 🥺🙁
=
The backup dancers are everything🤠
=
AOA랑 마마무 박봄 말고 다 애기들이네
=
와 역시 갓맘무 믿듣맘무 몸살처럼 몸이 부들부들 거릴정도로 소름 돋는....ㄷㄷ
=
I really cant stop watching this over and over again ❤️🔥🔥🔥
=
Jimin’s reactions killed me😂
=
아니 근데 나만 3:34 이때 전소연 웃는것처럼 보여ㅠㅠㅠㅠ ? 전소연 개좋아했었눈데 이때 웃는거 보고 좀 띠용함 나만 그래,,,?
=
I honestly like this version better! The reggae feels to this song was perfect
=
Lovelyz Kei reaction like she really want to be sexy like that but she can because she so cute and not suitable with sexy concept 😢
=
Jesus Mamamoo, they are such a good group. Stunning performance!!!!
=
마마무는 진짜 빈 구멍이 하나도 없어
=
Can’t stop watching this, just wowwww
=
Sigo con la boca abierta
=
What show is this cause it looks fun! Mamamoo tho damn they always go next level and I love it
=
💕💕 QUEENS MAMAMOO 💕💕
=
화사 분명 경쟁하라고 한거 같은데 단독콘서트로 만들어 버리면 어떡함 미쳤네진짜
=
*Mamamoo making queendom their own concert for 5 minutes*
=
THEY ARE THE BEST GIRL GROUP IN THIS GENERATION AND YOU CANT DENY IT
=
I'm obsessed with this Version !
=
화사의 언짢은, 같잖다는 저 표정이 너무 좋아 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
But like doesn't it look like park bom really misses her group looking at mamamoo?
=
Man, I NEVER smile at performances. I had a full-on GRIN the entire performance. So epic!
=
If they don't win after this performance, we're burning mnet's building down.
=
Mamamoo is one of the best things that happen to K-Pop. 






Also... Mnet never recommends Mamamoo's videos to me, is always the other videos groups.
=
WAHHH 1.2 MILLION IN JUST 14 HOURS WAH MAH QUEENS!
=
you know... I would let any one of them (specially hwasa) to step on my throat with stiletto heels if they wanted. Just saying
=
문별 언니...ㅁ...목줄...
=
I'm a casual listener of Mamamoo and don't really follow their stages. It so happens that their Queendom performances end up on my feed so I just got to comment here that damn, Mamamoo is a POWERHOUSE on stage.
=
Wheein omg gurlll ❤️🔥🔥🔥
=
I feel like bommie when she watch mamamoo she miss 2ne1 Does anyone feel like me.
=
소름 .. 드디어 마마무 입덕합니다 제가 죄송합니다 .... 화사언니 사랑합니다 ...
=
I heard AOA covered Good luck and egotistic 😂
=
진짜 완벽했다 후반부에 애드립 미쳤음
=
중간에 솔라가 가슴 올릴때 나만 놀랐나..
=
4:28  화사 시스터 얼굴 막쓰지말 라구,,
=
솔라 넘어져도 바로 노래부르면서 표정연기 하는거 보면 진짜 대단한 거 같음 나같으면 등에 땀나서 긴장했을텐데..ㄷㄷ 맘무 입덕 각
=
1:51 4:06 솔라 파트
=
4:28 นึกถึงสามช่าบ้านเราเลย55555
MAMAMOO สาวแซ่บ สาวแบดบอย สาวเซ็กซี่ สาวโรแมนติก <3.
=
I wish there was a fancam for this
=
Girls, girls on top as always my queens!
=
ma ding ding dong goin hard
=
if Solar's mistake wasn't repeated i think i wont even notice that. They nailed it once again 🔥
=
OMG Mamamoo never failed me! Riseeee and shineeeee♡
=
Solar’s part got me deaddd
=
Congrats MAMAMOO for winning 1 place







In my heart ❤
=
마마무 무대가 이렇게 보기 편하고 좋고 같이 신나는 이유는 아마 보컬이 탄탄해서 자신감들이 있어서 그런거같음 역시 갓-마무
=
Okay, Wheein is now my fave.  The girl's got soul - her vocals is powerful and she's cool - the uncommercial one of the group.  I like her.
=
mamamoo #1 in stage presence ALWAYS
=
솔라언니 끝에서 굽때문에 으억한건가ㅠㅠㅠ발목 괜찮으면 좋겠다ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
무대로 다 잡아 먹었다 1위는 마마무~~~~~~~
=
I don't like sexy concept but they are cool
=
I'm waiting for their concert.
=
마마무 컨셉, no출에 불만 있으신분즐 보시길

애초에 컨셉 회의 할때
마마무의 미니 콘서트가 컨셉이였고
그에 맞게 4명의 4가지 각기 다른 모습을 보여주다 마지막에는 하나가 되는 모습,

솔라 = 빅밴드
문별 = 힙합
화사 = 아프리카(?)
휘인 = 아파서 방송 참여 x

방송에서 직접 회의 하는 모습도 나오는데
도대체 뭐가 문제임?
지들이 본방 안봐놓고 논란거리도 아닌걸
논란 거리로 처 만듬 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

No출 하는 이유도
1차때 긴바지 긴팔 군악대? 의상 입었어서
이번에는 노출도 완전 정반대 모습 보여주기로 한건데

모르면 입이라도 열지마 ㅅㅂ ㅋㅋ
본방 처 보고 말해라 제발
=
I’m cheering in my room as if I’m there watching them live😅
=
3:34 웃은거?
=
Damn...‼️‼️‼️ The diva 🌹💜
=
*so it turned into another slapping mamamoo concert*
=
I couldn't count how many times i watch this video. To see if the views as well. Fighting #mamamoo
=
5 version in 1 song=
Hyejin - Fatal
Byulyi - Girl crush
Solar - Sexy
Wheein - Charisma
Mamamoo - Mamamoo
=
Omg Wheein Need More

SEXY CONCEP
=

=

=
After watching this, i forgot how the original song like
=
Am I the only one who find Jimin reaction at 1:50 and 4:08 some offensive? I'm not a AOA stan, sorry if i'm wrong
=
pls just step on me you four godnesses
=
Perfect!
=
화사음색 넘 좋다
=
The QUEENS !
=
아니 여기도 미쳤네 ㅠㅠ 퀸덤 미쳤네
=
2:09 지호 개귀여워 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
지민표정 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
OMG hwasa calm down
=
♥문별갓♥
=
My Queensland omg
=

=
넘 멋있어요~~.
=
청순빼고 다 할수 있는 마마무~~♥
=
❤❤❤❤❤🤤🤤🤤
=
마마무 는 역시 마마무다..
=
솔라 부분 젤 조타
=
다 잘하네
=
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ솔라 언니 진짜 너무 좋아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 어떻게 실수해도 이렇게 멋지게 이어나가죠 ,,, 마마무 최고다ㅠㅠㅠ 보기만해도 행복해요 ㅠㅠㅠ❤
=
와 진짜 실력에서 뿜어져나오는 아우라가 끝장남 진짜...
=
진짜 아주그냥 독보적이게 콘서트를 하셨어요...무대를..뒤집어놨어....흑
=
하루에 한 번은 꼭 보는 듯 ㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 마마무 노래 너무 잘하고 그냥 콘서트를 본 기분이예여 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
그냥 마마무 최고ㅎㅎㅎ
=
mamamooはあまりしりませんでしたが、これ見てから注目してます。
タレ目の口の大きい人がいいですね。少女時代スヨン、Gfriend　ソウォンとおなじFUJIYAペコちゃん系の顔ですね。
このパフォーマンスはちょっと凝りすぎで印象がバラバラですが、さすが実力派です。
ただ個人的にはチョアが好きなので高音部分がなかったのが残念。
=
Woooooooooow
=
퀸덤보면서 마마무랑 아이들 입덕할것같다ㅠㅠ 오마이걸때문에 봤는데 마마무 리액션도 좋고 말하시는게 딱봐도 착해보이고 아이들은 뭐 말도 할거 없고ㅠㅠㅠ AOA도 요번에 너무 오졌음ㅠㅠ
=
마마무 에너지가 너무 좋아요!!
=
ฮวาซานึกว่ายังโอม
=
I just need Moonbyul to take me out please.
=
솔라가 지민이 마더파더 어쩌구 랩 할 때 진짜 완전 놀랐음... 그걸 여기에 쓰다니 완전 천재 만재 김용선
=
What is the name of the show?
Thanks
=
Personally my favourite Queendom performance of this round, especially since each member got to show her charms!!
=
박봄은 왜나온가지
=
i… my bi heart… moonbyul's growl gets me every time!! absolutely love wheein's hair like this. i just— these queens!!!
=
와 진짜 멋있어
=
Mamamoo just makes me forget of my sexuality everytime I watch them omg!
=
Hwasa: maknae who??
Moonbyul: she dont spit fire, she is the fire
Solar: 30 and slaying
Wheein: slayingggggggg!
=
Agko labay ya, antuya abuyak.
=
솔라 미쳤다..ㅅㅂ
=
마마무 할말없다....시카고나 무슨 뮤지컬같아.. ㅠㅠㅠ문별이 등장에 턱빠질뻔..
=
5:01 sorry to interrupt but Bomi is such a baby 😂❤
=
STAN ARTISTS!!!
=
ok but moonbyul's part...






*gay panic*
=
Jimin looks so offended eye-
=
3:50 fav dance part of breakthrough twice, anyways mamamoo and g idle slayed this performance so much
=
와... 그냥 미챴지....  그냥 모든무대가 씹레전드
=
난 이게 4명 개개인의 장점이 드러나서 너무 좋은거 같음..역시 갓마무
=
군부대 무대네요^^~^^
=
문별 볼때마다 뭔사 제스처나 랩스탈이 약간 남자 아이돌같음 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Mamamoo are the real queens for totally changing up the song and making it their own, highlighting each of the members' charm. They owned the stage and owned the song. 

"It's like a concert" YASS GURL. This is what years of performing LIVE on stage makes you become: A true performer. 

Thanks Mamamoo! xx
=
그렇게 짧은 시간안에 이정도 완선도를....역시 진짜 대단한 프로들이다!!! 멋지다 !!!!!!
=
No one's gonna comment how hot WHEEIN is in RED? 🔥🔥
=
girllll, the charisma, the talent. mamamoo is literally on another level.
=
1:51 4:10
=
Who is the group that are wearing like army outfits???
=
Mamamoo is that girl group where all members break rules and don't mind what other says. They will do whatever the hell they want and will rock every concept, no, will slay every thing they do!
=
I swear to god if Hwasa is native speaker, US music industry (or even world) will be shaking
=
Solar uhmmm-- I think I'm gay 😂
=
진짜 콘서트 온 줄알았어요. ㅠㅠ 방송에서 못 볼 줄 알았던 문별 사슬 ㅠㅠ 그 때 그 의상 아닙니까? ㅠㅠ 각자의 매력을 진짜 잘 살리셨고ㅠㅜ 저번 콘서트 생각 나는 무대구성이라 행복했습니다. 

진심 마마무 흥해라
=
Mamamoo bring the new concept itself, by showing every members own colours n making it like a mini concert in 1 songs. Risk taker.  Most important the live vocals that u still can clearly heard over the playback. Im not a fan of monotonous vocals so with mamamoo i can easily recognize voice of each members. Its a brilliant perf.
=
If this is immortal song then probably mamamoo win their 4th! 😂
=
solar’s rap is very surprise
=
Hwasa, Wheein and Solar channeling different types os sexiness. While our dear Moonbyul here is making ovaries explode. 😍
=
Wheein so beautiful🔥
=
문별 무슨 일이야 착장도 너무 좋고 그간 여돌들이 보여주던 섹시랑은 다른 섹시라 너무 좋다 언니 사랑해요
=
HWASA’S STAGE PRESENCE IS UNREAL. SHE IS A QUEEN.
=
It's seeing them like this is what make me so damn proud
=
진짜 너무 좋다ㅜㅜ 이 무대를 위해 얼마나 고민하고 연습했는디 보여서 더 좋아
=
I love how seolhyun always seems to enjoy every performance... 

Mamamoo are queen. Everyone in this competition are queens. I love watching all of them perform!
=
화사 레게 컨셉으로 앨범 하나만 더 내 줘 ㅜㅜㅜ
=
El concepto que usaron no esta mal, pero siento que no pego en nada con la canción, no me gustó...
=
1:49 and 4:08 Really MNET? I see what you're doing 😂
=
완전 마마무 노래로 만들었다
=
Is the Best swag i ever seen
=
Jimin's face is priceless
=
SOLAR's RAP İS AMAZİNG
=
Okay Solar. I see you and I still love you!
=
Im turkish fan🇹🇷 i love you mamamoo🌈💙🧡💙💙
=
They are one of the groups today that sounded really good during live performances. I can't believe I will be able to see them perform on the 21st live. The power that these 4 women hold.
=
What genre is solar's part???
=
레게풍의 화사와 랩 메이킹 문별 푸스 솔라 와 진짜 생각도 못했음 ;;;
=
TOTALLY QUEENS💣💕
=
와 솔라고음 진짜 🙏🏻
=
헐 화사한테 사랑에 빠진거같애
=
OH MY GOD MAMAMOO
=
Still stuck here :) And I'm loving it😍😍😍
=
Putang ina ang galing.
=
Why does jimin look literally like a dead zombie
=
AOA is proud 😎 . The way they smile while watching Mamamoo singing their song are so sincere , i feel that 😭 . And the moment Hyejeong said 'gwenchana gwenchana' after Solar almost slipped on the stage , i'm so touched 😭 .
=
I don’t know how many times I have watched this and still went “wow” at the end. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
=
OMG all of them are burning meeeeeeee 🔥🔥🔥🔥
=
문별 첫번째 가사 뭔가 아쉽당...
=
The outfits look a little cheap :/// not the best stage of them maybe because im used to better ones of them .. i hate hwasas and solars outfits so much im sorry
=
아 화사야 ... 진쩌 뭘해도 다 저렇세 섹시하게 소화하고 .. 진짜 최고댜
=
Mamamoo putting up real performance 😍 Damn! My girls you're burning the stage 💕
=
Mammoo never disappoints
=
4:02 highlight
=
1저엉덩방아춤 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ시미수ㅣ미야 네
=
MAMAMOO HAS THE BEST STAGE PRESENCE OUT OF ANY KPOP GIRL GROUP. YES I SAID IT.
=
I just wanna hear the original, that I've never heard.
=
Hwasa is thicc
=
7,076,279 191014
=
다른 노래 들을 때는 원곡,가수가 생각나는데 원곡이 생각 안나네
=
Hwasa is my fav. 😍😍😍
=
Hwaaasaaa
=
Pleaseee hwasa pleaseee step on meeee!!! Damn
=
진짜 마마무란그룹은 데뷔5년차인데
ㄹㅇ 노련미는 데뷔10년차 뺨침
=
5:13 hwasa sings " i like me " :v
=
다른 영상 보면 그냥 팬심으로 누구누구 너무 예쁘다 이런식으로 그냥 팬심같지만
마마무는 그냥 프로같다
다른 그룹 리액션도 확연히 다르고 
스타일도 독보적이고
1명1명이 나오더라도 한4,5명나온듯한
포스가 개인개인마다있는듯
=
화사는 그냥.. 어느무대든 자기것으로 만드는게 억지로 하는게 아니라 진짜 그냥 천생 가수 무대를 겁내지않고 무대를 사랑하는게 보여서 너무좋고 문별이도 랩 임팩트도 있고랩은 라임이 너무 잘들려서 좋고 솔라는 ㅠㅠ 이쁘고 실수해도 당황안하고 바로 자리잡는게 진짜 천생 프로가수 휘인이는 흔들림없는 가창력이 너무 멋있당 마마무 흥해라 ㅎㅎ 10월달에 보러갈게❣️❣️❣️
=
한번도 안본 사람은 있어도 한번만 본 사람은 없을듯..... 화사 무대장악력과 문별도 랩 잘한다는 생각 못했는데 이번에 짝짝짝 할때 소름돋아버림; 누워서 가창력 뽐내버리는 휘인은 말해뭐해 아무것도 안해도 이쁜 솔라당황하지 않고 무대 계속 이어나가는거 너무 프로패셔널해 멋있어 최고ㅜㅜ 마마무 is 뭔들
=
개인적으로 사실 문별 파트 뒤에 솔라 파트가 이어질 때 갑자기 조용해서 좀 분위기 죽는 느낌 났는데 솔라 파트 시작하니까 시바 그딴거 없고 그냥 솔라 파트에 녹는 느낌임. 진짜 약간 물엿이나 꿀처럼 천천히 스며드는 느낌 .
=
춤을 저렇게 추면서 노래를 부르네 ㄷㄷ
=
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌ개웃기넼ㅋㅋ
=
문별 사랑해ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
마마무가 실력파 그룹인게 진짜 느껴진다..... 컨셉도 잘 잡은 거 같긴 한 데 확실히 실력이 돋보적이다
=
역시..기대를져버리지않는 우리의 마마무..❤
=
솔라 넘어질 뻔 한거 덕분에 라이브하는거 제대로 인증함ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ '억-' 소리나는거 짱귀ㅠㅠ
=
Moonbyul oppaaaa 😍😍😍😍
=
Queen Group👑🔥🔥💓💓
=
3:39 damn only queens will recover as fast as solar
=
그냥 대박
=
개멋있어
=
Moonbyul oppaaaa
=
별이 랩 너무 좋아ㅠㅠ마마무 진짜 천재다
=
넘나사기캐아니냐 다른그룹이랑은 차원이너무다른데 엠넷이 실수한듯,,,
=
MOONBYUL W THOSE CHAINS IMMDKFKDKDKDK
=
Jimin's reactions are the best omg haha!
=
뭐야..문별 랩개머싯자나.. ㅠ 미쳣다
=
This is how a performance is done, amazing
=
Wow!!  Unbelievable...
=
마마무의 무대에1위를 투표하고 싶다면~
https://m.media.daum.net/m/entertain/poll/10806/
=
That stare in the end! Moonbyul will be the end of me.
=
음원에 솔라 puss 짤린거 진짜 눈물...
=
The musics at the end reminds me of dangdut...
=
이건 정말 레전드
=
THESE QUEENS ARE ALWAYS SLAYIIING😍
=
저런 의상만 입다가 수트 입으니까 극찬 받는 AOA, 거의 항상 수트 입다가 한 번 이런 의상 입으니까 욕 먹는 마마무. 제대로 좀 알고 먼저 욕 해
=
Solar...... I'm lesbian
=
I just realized that she almost fell the first time I saw this I thought it was part of the performance
=
love how a shit ton of people didnt like the arrangement saying it was too messy, yet mamamoo still takes first place for this round
=
진짜 마마무.. 무대 장악력이 다대단한 거 같아.... 특히 화사........
=
my wig now: good luck lucky go go bebe!
=
what is the name of this program?
=
Mamamoo have a way to turn things around and OWN it! 

*i was so proud while seeing the others reactions XD*
=
이거 듣고있으니까 원곡 음이 기억안남 ㅋㅋ...
=
내가 알던 마마무인가요?
5년차대뷔초팬인데 
대박 마마무가아닌거같아. ㄷㄷ. 솔라님지금은발목괜찮으시다고하니 편안
=
cada vez estas chicas me sorprenden más
=
1:51, 4:09
Don't know if this counts as evil editing but Mnet pls stop :(
=
I've just seen a bunch of clips from this show and I must say.
THOSE GIRLS ( from all groups) BE SHOWING EVERYONE WHO RUNS THE INDUSTRY. 
THEY ALL ARE SO POWERFUL. QUEENS INDEED
=
If I were the other artiste watching this I would have cried during moonybuls part WHEN SHE CAME WITH THOSE CHAINS YOU KNEW IT WAS OVER
=
I enjoyed this performance. My queens 💜! Each member put their own spin on the song. I'd say Hwasa and Solar's part was my favorite. I'm glad Wheein is back too! Go girls 💜 hopefully they'll be in the top 3.
=
1:21 same girllll😍
=
Excuse me but moonbyul look like a daddy with bdsm kinks uhm ;-----;
=
They're the God of stage
=
Mamamoo just made Good Luck their song in their 4colors!! No one puts on a show like them and engages with the Audience like them mini concert!! I love my babies Moonbyul brought her chains!!! 😍😍😳🔥I love Rude Wheein and Rapper Yong!!
=
Alright, I do like Mamamoo. İt was an original idea to show different concepts but i think its just divided performance sooo much and i didnt really enjoyed the whole..except that,its really amazing they sang live, dance well and put an different and original idea. 
Overall; it was a good performance,for me i couldnt able to focus anywhere so i cant really say that i will die for this  but there is an effort which cant compare with something so...Good job girls. İ dont care who wins that show but im happy to see everyone giving their all. ❤️

What's the fandom name of mamamoo?
=
화사 진짜 독보적이다...
=
How many times I have watched this already? XD
Lost the count....
=
Do MAMAMOO know they own my life?
=
Im sorry but, why its better than original song :(😫😫
=
Moonbyul the nation's rapper, no one's doing it like her 👏👏👏
=
The chair solar kicked was so lucky
=
Can't believe that one skit that solar did where she was acting like Jimin in unpretty rapstar came true because she is literally rapping Jimin's part. Solar really out here spoiling queendom a couple of years before. I'M-
=
반응 보고 싶은데 한글이 안 보여 ㅋ ㅋ





마마무 멋있어
=
Solar recovered from her almost fall with such grace and professionalism, the members didn't even realize that she almost fell and i had to watch with the others group reaction to realize that too.
=
솔라 랩 쯔럿다
=
How could I forgot that Mamamoo is at their peak when doing cover <3

=
*You're looking right at the BADASS VOCAL QUEENS YASSS*
=
하아... 벼리 랩 가사 왜케 오글거려...ㅋㅋㅋ
벼리니깐 할수 있는 랩이지...
이거 노래방에서는 못 불러 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
it looks like a full blown concert
=
IM SORRY BUT YUGI’S HAIR
=
where can i watch this full?
=
Mamamoo really are the best. They were all born to be artist and performers. They’re all charismatic. Every time I see their performance I can really see their passion for music and performing.
=
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
진짜 다 너무 좋은데 솔라랑 휘인 의상 넘 아쉽다... 본인들이 좋아서 입은 거겠지만 그냥... 안 예쁨...
=
Monbyuuuuuul
=
사랑해 언니들
=
I'm not even exaggerating when I say Mamamoo never fails to take my breath away. *now time to head for the preparation of my funeral*
=
마마무는 그냥 즐기면서 하는구나 경연이 아니라 .. 대단하다 역시.
=
문별 랩 좋아여
=
마마무는 그냥 완전체
=
Who won this round??
=
Y’all see this shit? THIS is what it means to give a performance! Mamamoo is that girl group you can’t deny with their stage presence and vocal prowess! Hopefully they get 1st place this week! ❤️
=
wheein really snapped here. periodt.
=
Can i love moonbyul with all my heart???
=
1:21 same sister ,SAMEEEEEEEEEEEE
=
Can someone please tell me the results
=
Is it me who think that they make the note higher than the original??
=
Where was Wheein during the practice? did she have another schedule?
=
Chương trình này tên là gì vậy ạ
=
this is art at its finest
=
솔라는 왜맨날 저런 컨셉이지ㅠ 넘 아쉽다...
=
*We stan, we stan.*
=
How to not be gay for Byule? TT can't she is more powerful than 100000000000000 of Oppas
=
미안하지만 왜케 웃긴겨 노래집중이 안되네 ㅋㅋ
=
Son las mejores
=
I am so into Solar and Hwasa, like there's no going back to heterosexuality :/
=
This show needs sistar 🔥🔥
