Who else expected cl to come out when the rap part starts
=
How many people agree that the FOUR fingers Bom raised as ending posture represent 2NE1 four members... Makes me wanna cry
=
cheetah appears.

soyeon: she's my trainer!
jimin: she was my enemy! (in unpretty rapstar)
=
Bom is such a great performer, you can tell she uses everything she has to entertain that crowd. And this is only 1/4 of the power 2NE1 held. I have so much love and respect for her.
=
Park Bom will release her comeback "First Snow" on December 10 feat. Sandara Park!
=
Minnie reacting to this be like





*I want some bom*
=
봄이가 노래하는데 옆에 랩해줄 씨엘이 없다니 이게 무슨 말도 안되는 소리야 2ne1못잃어 나 죽어 갓그룹 돌려줘ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
진짜음색은 그거잖아... 양현석이 연습생들 죽도록 따라해서라도 갖고싶어했던음색....그래서 와이지 걸그룹 음색이 다 저런 비슷한거임 ㅋㅋㅋ 원조는 박봄이고
=
This is how many INTERNATIONAL fans park bom have🇹🇷


⬇️
=
Is it bad I like this more than the real ver
=
근데 솔직히 박봄에 치타면 경연이 아니라 축하무대급이지;;; 여기 껴있는 게 이상할 정도
=
THE OTHER ARTISTS ARE EVEN HYPED WHEN BOM STARTED TO SING! AND THIS GOT 5TH?!
=
이거 누가 무대했을때
치타 친구 박봄
치타랑 한판 뜬 지민
치타한테 랩 배운 소연이라고해서 엄청웃겼는데 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
왜 아무도 코디얘기 안해줘ㅠㅠ 코디 너무 이쁘잖아ㅠㅠ 진짜 봄 언니ㅠㅠ 막 자기 차버린 자식 완전 죽여버리고 피로 물ㅈ든 옷 입은것 같아ㅜㅠ 전 언니한테 죽어도 되요ㅠㅠ 언니 처음봤는데 반했어요ㅠㅠ 음색 미쳤다진짜ㅠㅠ 전 이제부터 언니의 충실한 개가 될께요ㅠㅠ
=
애초에 팬덤들불러놓고 공정한 평가가 가능함? 박봄이 팬덤수로 밀리는거 너무 당연한거아니냐 실력으로 평가하게 공개투표해라 아 그것도 조작하려나 엠넷 ㅅㅂ
=
This would've been better if the whole 2NE1 came
=
전소연은 되게 신기하겠다...
한때 나를 가르쳐주셨던 선생님이 
이제 내가 만든 노래를 치타가 불러주니까..
=
I don't really care if she wins or lose...i'm glad she's back 😢
=
근데 박봄은 짜증나는게 음향이 너무 안좋음 . 딴 그룹들은 다 mr깔고 부분부분은 립싱크로 하는데 박봄은 그룹노래를 혼자서 라이브로 하다보니 너무 벅참. 물론 그럼에도 잘한다는게 함정이지만
=
농담 안하고 씨엘이나 산다라박 한명만 데리고 한번만 경연하면 안돼냐?


진짜 티비앞에 서서 108배하면서 볼텐데
=
이거 주 관객층이 팬들이라 그렇지 머글판 투표시키면 박봄 압승일텐데.... 진짜 이 무대가 파압 보다 아래라는게 너무 말이안된다 아무리 자기아이돌이라지만 투표는 제대로 해야지...
=
I mean she is a queen after all
=
They know we would have died if CL showed up for the rap part. So they got another queen instead.
=
I dont care about the ranking whats important is she showcase her talent thats all matters. 👸🏻
=
I Love that she isn’t even trying, she just knows by heart how to please a crowd
=
The amount of Koreans in here should really go to support her when she perform
=
This is not a fair competition she deserve 1st on this performance
=
I was so disappointed by the rankings. She deserve better. I really don't think I will care now about the rankings. All I want is to see Miss BOM on a show.
=
This was the most trending song from queendom on iTunes and Apple Music. Queen BOM 👑🎤🥇
=
봄이 언니로 홍보는 다해놓고 러블리즈 떨어질까봐 순위조작하는 암넷^^  1차때는 마이크로 무대 망쳐놓더니^^ 이 순위가 말이되냐
=
Bom is the only one performing and this performance is already epic. Imagine if Whole 2NE1 performed there it would be legendary
=
명백히 팬들 아니고 활동중인 아이돌들이나 보컬이나 댄스 선생님들 와서 무대 평가했으면 분명 상위권에 머물렀을 무대
=
GDragon was right...Bom's voice makes any song sound better
=
Park boom means business. Shes not joking around.
=
박봄 힘내라 
니가 이딴 프로 나와서 노래부를 레벨이  아닌데
=
그냥 곡을 본인것으로 씹어드셧네 ... ㄹㅇ 그냥 비교불가 소화력 쩝니다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 짬에서 나오는 바이브가 요런것이군아 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
근데 순위다필요없는게 정작 본인들은  경쟁을하면서 감탄하고 서로 훈훈해하는 분위기임 그냥 서로 멋진작품만들어 공유하는거지
=
댓글 보는데 존나 억울했겠다. 진짜 환멸나는게 진짜 약쟁이들은 티비도 잘 나왔는데 박봄은 그 얘기 하나로 방송에도 잘 나오지 못했음. 이해 안갔는데 실제 얘기보니까 더 이해 안간다 마녀사냥 오지노; 진짜 억울했을듯.
=
I loved how she still kept her makeup style when she was in 2ne1
=
This is still the best performance Park Bom ever pulled off in this show.
=
전부터 느낀건데 박봄 레드 진짜 잘받는다 예전에 빨간머리도 리즈였는데
=
Bommi's han is the cutest thing ever!
=
봄누나 여기댓글보면..기뻐서 눈물흘리실거같다...ㅠ
진짜 진심어린글많네 ㅠㅠ
=
이건 진짜 완벽한 커버무대임 원곡 멜로디가 생각이 안남 계속 박봄 버전으로 부름
=
진짜 역시 박봄이다. 진짜 실력있는 전설은 어디 안감.
=
Bom really made this song like her own. Fking lit.
=
Bom’s on a whole nother level!
=
그냥 등장 하자마자 일등 찍어야 하는 무대인데 무슨 기준으로 순위 판정한건지는 몰라도 진짜 멍청하다
=
i feel like not enough people appreciated how good bom was in queendom😢❤️
=
뭔가 박봄은 남자에게 이런식으로  여러번 당해서 그냥 마음에 악바리가 가득차 부르는거 같고,

여자 아이들은 이런 일을 많이 당해서 여유로운 듯 행동하지만 속으로 칼을 갈며 부르는느낌,,,,
=
Seems like she’s singing her own song here.
=
와 오졌다 진짜 그냥 박봄 스타일이 그대로 녹인느낌이라 더 멋져ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Queendom did her bad. She deserves MORE than this! She was a member of the most powerful group 2ne1! It was LEGENDARY and even as a solo artist she's standing strong! You can do it Bom! Fighting!!!
=
이거 5위한건 그냥 동년배들이 저기 없어서 그런거같다 쉬입헐 라떼는 말이여...
=
Park Bom has such a unique voice. Especially in Fire. Like no one can sing her parts
=
Chettah is soyeon's trainer in produce 101
Park Bom is miyeon's trainer in YG

And they're covering hann. Their students song 😂
=
Bom is better than them sadly to say but it's true!
=
This is how cover do. It has more sales than the original ahahahaha.. ranking is a shet. People know who can sell records
=
난 박봄이 커버한걸로
한 이라는 노래처음들어봐서
그런지 아이들인가 개네꺼 원곡들어봤는데 박봄이 커버한게더좋다
=
This and AOA's performance should have tied for 1St.
=
She sang it not like a cover but like it’s her own song. “Han” sounds like a whole new song but still with it’s identity. Love it
=
she's flashing 21 with her fingers at the end--just like Minzy did years ago at the end of her dance battle with hyuna, gain and nicole.
=
Bom really slay this performance ✨🔥🔥
=
내가 진짜 들은것중에 충격이 이게 그룹 곡이라고
하던데 근데 그걸 소화 해내는게 너무 대단하다는게
생각이 들고 너무 잘하고 역시 대선배는 다르다 란
생각이 듬,, 가사가 꽉 차셔 너무 좋고 노래 집중최고
게다가 이게 (여자)아이들 곡이란것도 몰랐음 ...
=
전소연이랑 박봄 콜라보 함 하면 좋을거 같다
=
짜증나네 누구보다 커버곡이란 미션에 이만큼 잘맞는 애가 있나...아예 원곡자가 생각도 안나는데???????? 5위 진짜ㅅㅂ ㅋㅋㅋ 어이없을정도
=
3:11 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아 진짴ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ박봄무대 잘 보고 있었는데 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아 승희때문에 깸ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ너무 귀여워 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
She back wow....... Watch out girls it's gonna be tough in this industry cause she is here once again to rock the stage in her own way and style😉🤩
=
진짜 국보급음색과 독보적 보컬스타일..음색은 진짜 따라할수도없고..
=
The 2ne1 hand sign at the end, I might be crying. She's so talented, I love her so much 💕
=
I can't be the only one who thought she was gonna bring out CL!
=
I need a studio version of this 😭
=
Why I always cry when I'm watching her all performance hear.
=
중간중간에 놀라는 아이돌들 개귀엽다 진짜 ㅋㄱㅋㄲㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄲㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄲㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄲㅋㅋ 진짜 놀람을 표정으로 다보여줘
=
When they said "those goosbumps" i felt that
=
imagine if it was “feat. CL” 

...


the internet would break

edit: thnx for the likes by the way, blackjacks powers are scAry aF
=
Honestly Bom is always amazing but she held her own when she competed against groups and adapted a group song to be a solo with a feature for the rep section. Adapting a song developed for a group is very difficult
=
SHE GOT 5TH FROM THIS??? THIS WAS SO GOOD
=
holy crap she owned the song I LOVE HER VOICE AND THE CONCEPT SHE WENT WITH
=
Who wants CL and Bomie for a collab ? 😍
=
She made this song like it was for 2ne1...that feel
=
Legendary is in God's level, how human can judge the Goddess?
=
Bom can literally make a girl group herself.
=
와... 원곡보다 중독성 엄청나네... 이거 벌써 몇번째 보는건지 기억도 안남...
=
아이들 버전은 '아,딱 아이들이다'이런 느낌이고 박봄은 박봄의 느낌대로 정말 잘함(컨셉 소화를 정말 잘함)
+아이들 한은 한이 맺혀 복수 하겠다는 복수의 칼날을 들어내는 것 같고, 박봄은 그냥 그 칼을 목에 딱 대가지고 죽이기 1초 직전 느낌..








결론:양쪽 다 잘함
=
I’m getting nostalgic. There’s just something magical whenever Bom performs a song. The feelings she gives you >.<
=
tonight SCARECROW will be trending again...
=
We all know she should have won this competition , hands down . All the girls were her fans not her competitors
=
I think it’s safe to take queendom results with a grain of salt
=
*Bom should do concepts like this more*
=
When Cheetah comes out, I imagine that CL comes out rapping, Dara get a mid part and filling Bom's part as a backing vocal and baby Mingki dance till break the stage. 

🔥🔥🔥
=
This is Park Bom song now.
=
I don't know how many times I replay this hahahaha this feel like a solid solo comeback from her 💖💖
=
박봄 성형한게 확 느껴지는데 그렇다고 페북에 성괴들 처럼 혐오스러운 느낌은 안들고 보면볼수록 귀여운 느낌들음.... 진짜 이쁜 인형같고.... 박봄 순위권 갔음 좋겠다 ㅠ❤
=
kpop is getting cleaned y'all, finally
=
와 근데 전소연은 진짜 감회가 새롭겠다 자기가 만든 곡을 프듀101에서 자기를 가르쳐준 치타가 무대에 서서 랩을 했으니 ㄷㄷ 게다가 완전 대선배 박봄도 자기 음악을 부르공...
=
I love Cheetah but CL would have bought the attitude to match Bom then YGE would have been shook.
=
Damn this is hot🔥🔥🔥
=
원곡 만큼 좋기 힘든데 이건 더좋은데?
=
I expected Bom's rank to increase for at least 1, I can't believe she get 5 again even though this performance is so good
=
I don't get why she even has to join this show. She doesn't have to prove anything else at all because she's already a legend. I mean, 2NE1 is already a legend.
=
Wow....when i compare how g idle sing this versus bom....bom version is singing with feelings...g idle dance choreo and voice remix...both are good...but i like park boom version..maybe because i love ability to sing than dance...applause for both...
=
0:32 아이돌 아니 진짜 왜캐 귀여워 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
4:11 박봄도 귀엽자나 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
그래 너네 다해라
=
I keep coming here. Like every days without failed
=
JIMIN’S REACTION WHEN CHEETAH CAME OUT ASKSKSK
=
imagine if 2ne1 is there, they would've eaten them all at once
=
The most v*ews (G)idle song, Thanks neverland for help my bom Alone in this show, (G)idle and Bom top one in my heart
=
I missed her so much! Growing up I always looked up to 2ne1 as my favorite kpop group. It's the group that introduced me to kpop. Their songs were revolutionary like fire and the solo Bommie did "you and I". You can do it bommie! Fighting!
=
This performance of Bom deserves more
=
음색 미쳤다 ㄷㄷ
=
이게 5위고 러블리즈가 4위라고??ㅋㅋㅋ
=
4:10 does anyone here remember the sign in her right hand?
=
박봄 목소리 넘좋아ㅠㅠ
=
She’s the Korean version of Beyoncé 💗💕💕👀
=
크 역시 와이지 2세대의 짬밥은 무시할 수 있는게 아냐
=
It must be hard for Bom to sing a group's song alone but she killed stage.
=
확실히 음색은 최고인듯
=
bom looks so good here jesus chrisT
=
she’s so stable 💆‍♀️
=
I feel like watching boms solo concert. This is amazing! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
=
3:16 Hwasa in stunned silence-- don't forget she's a blackjack and cried when she got to meet Bom for the first time.
=
Queen park bom❤❤❤
=
Soyeon saying "Trainer Cheetah". ❤❤
=
I think this is her best performanceee on queendom
=
She did the 6 part perfectly her voice was powerful
=
박봄이 어떻게 부를까 기대하면서 봤는데 첫소절 딱 듣는 순간 역시는 역시다 라는 생각드네
=
I still cant get enough of this performance! It’s addictive ❤️
=
3:11 though... Cracks me up.
=
I am so freakin happy to see Bom back doing what she loves. Amazing
=
AMAZING🔥❤️
=
와 소연은 엄청 영광일 것 같음..대선배가 자기가 작사작곡한 노래부르고 프듀에서 쌤이었던 분이 피처링...물론 한이라는 노래를 작사작곡한 소연님도 대단하고 아 모르게ㅛ고 그냥 다 멋짐........
=
2:54


표정변화ㄷㄷ 역시 박봄❤❤
=
Oh my BOMMMMMMIEEEE... I MISS YOU. 2NE1 SARANGHAE.
This is such a fantastic cover. Where's the studio cover on this one. I want to sing this. MAKE WAY FOR THE QUEEN. BLACKJACKS 4EVER.
=
The hand sign at the end!!!!! 😍❤️
=
Bom killed it. Sooo good!!!!! The song is perfect for her unique voice, and she sounded good (my fav. Part) when she sang the remember at the beginning.👌🏽 ❤️ Congratulations Bom.
=
The baddass female Park Bom is back... 😎😎😎
=
MY QUEEN, MY GODDESS, MY DIVA... I LOVE YOU!!!
=
When soyeon said it remind me of 2ne1...i be like yeah me toooooooo.who missed the queens .
=
This was the most trending song from queendom on iTunes and Apple Music. Queen BOM 👑🎤🥇
=
Bom need to release this type of song really suit her well .. i miss badass Bom 😭😭
=
When Bom cover a song, it will become her song.. She should make a studio version of this for real.. Damn it feel like a brand new song.. We cant deny her voice character change the song ambience..
=
Bom : bom bom bomi olkkayo 
Me : spring already back for you queen
=
Idle's reactions are so cute🤩
=
1:39 nice playback. I love Bom tho😜
=
This is everything ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
솔직히 말해서 박봄 불리하지 않나 .. 다른 그룹들은 4명 이상 되는데 박봄 혼자서 곡을 소화해낸다는게 어려울텐데.. .. 그런데도 박봄 진짜 잘한다 ..
=
3:38 my fav part that was so sexy and powerful😍
=
I can never get enough of Bom💖💖
=
I was expecting CL to come for the rap part, it would've been legendary but Cheetah killed it
=
Bommie is the cutest ever! never give up! T
he Best voice!
=
Win or lose, who cares. As long as we get to see Bom perform. She's already a queen regardless.
=
How i wish one of the 2NE1 member could perform with bom in this show!!!!!
=
Coming back here 😍 love her version 💕💕💕
=
I really like this version.
=
I'm in loveeeee
=
Boom, I've been watching you since you've been struggling doing street performances for your album and I think you deserve this spotlight.

This is a woman that doesn't quit, RESPECT!!      😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
=
I didnt know G-Idle before listening to that performance and I thought it was her own song 😭😭😭 Park Bom is the queen. It sounds like her own song.
=
Respect to park bom🙇🙇
The performance was legendary
=
Wow, incredible. Cheetah comes in like a bombshell. Bom, she carries a group song easily. When she is dancing with the camera live, that is incredibly difficult to do. Great cover, great performance. Park Bom for the win.
=
Stream this stage reach 10M views before Bom & Dara Comeback with new song "First Snow" 🔥🔥🔥
=
*(G)I-dle* :WE ARE THE NEXT GENERATION, NO ONE CAN STO-

*Park Bom* :Jerry, Hold my watermelon.
=
1위같은데 왜 순위가 낮은거야 ,, 레전드무대야 이거
=
SHE DESERVE SONG OF THE YEAR!!! KEEP VOTING OUR BOMMIE DEAREST BOMBSHELL AND BLACKJACK!!! MAKE OUR CANDY PROUD!!!
=
Let me just say Park Bom's dancers are just fierce.
=
Bom youre so so amazing, your voice is so âmzing 💜💜💜💜💜💜
=
Yeahhh. I am definitely convinced that Bom is no longer a dancer and to see her performing this uptempo song with choreography makes her look  out of place. 

Like, a Mariah Carey LOL
=
I can imagine how so yeon proud the song sing by a livin legend.💓💓💝💝
=
every single day im coming to watch this legendary performance cmon y'all IT'S PERFECT
=
they should change the show name from queendom to *queen BOM*
=
Imagine Dara walk through the door instead of cheetah walking in seconds later Minzy then finally CL 🤤
=
OMG aku merinding setiap denger suara park boom 💕💕💕💕
=
Park Bom have unique voice, she still the best as kpop main vocal
=
She is one men as the whole teams, it is not fair at beginning. I am not complaining, I just want to say it is such a pity.
=
Blackjacks coming out from their graves upon hearing Bom's singing voice.. We protect and support our Queen!!
=
If it's CL who came and be Bom's guest it would be the end of the show! 🔥
=
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 할말은 많은데 어후.. 박봄 화이팅 ㅠㅠㅠ 제발 흥해라 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow kill The stage, perfect!
=
Cheetah has stage presence 💙
=
Just like G-dragon used to say about Park Bom “ every song she sing, it will become special ! “
=
아무리 생각해도 러블리즈 식스센스보다 아래인게 이해안가...아이들도 밑인데
=
Park bom😍❤️
=
I just noticed in every video i watch, whenever bom perform, there are people watching with mouth wide open...in awe??
=
역시 박봄 클라스가 여전히 대단하네요!
=
G idle must be really honored for park bom to cover their song
=
Omg! It too late for me to see this. Park Bom is a real queen 👑 Sorry for forget this fact in a long time. Now I will remember and support to you my queen 👸.
=
2NE1 STYLE！NOLZA！
=
Damn, Park Bom your really a QUEEN 😂👏👏👏👏 im really enjoying your performance QUEEN and shout out to Cheetah unnie🤗💕😍😍 love the colab👏👏👏

Dont care the rank, as long as She perform like her own Free concert and audience are enjoying her performance ,its not being competing anymore👏👏👏👏
Im really amaze BOM👏👏👏👏👸
=
THE 2NE1 SIGN IN THE END GOT ME OMG IM CRYING
=
This is the most confident I've seen Park Bom, I'm so happy she's getting her carisma back and self confidence! This has also been her best look since her comeback to the kpop industry! So happy and proud of Bommi ❤
=
That ending pose it’s what I didn’t know that I needed
=
jimin and soyeon’s reactions when cheetah came lmao i love them
=
QUEEN PARK BOM ❤️
She should have a concert in the Philippines!
=
4:11 aw she changed it to 2NE1 SIGN!
=
The song already gave me a little 2ne1 vibe, the fact she cover it's even awesome
=
I literally thought it's gonna be CL :(((( guess I expected too much. I miss them in one stage. All four of them.
=
the ending is adorable!
=
퀸덤 끝나기 전에 다라든 채린이든 민지든 같이 서는 거 한번이라도 보고 싶다ㅠㅠ
=
3:48 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 너무 귀엽다
=
3 million!!!! Who’s doing it like her?? A single woman did that!!
=
T A L E N T O
P E R S E V E R A N C I A
Y A M O R. 
ESO Y MAS ME INSPIRAS ❤️
=
댓글에 박봄 처음본다는 댓이있다...
=
Korean Mariah , my generation of kpop💜 she will always be my first and last idol 😭 love u bom 💜💜
=
Sesly i love how other grp respects each other....💞🥰 especially to their senior park boom...
=
She slay the song singing it solo. while it is a girl group song.. Hwasa was like,, i really want to collaborate with her.. omg it would be a blowwwww
=
that voice i guess iam addicted
=
She's so beautiful
=
I listen to all Park Bom songs everyday on Spotify... :3
=
SHE'S THE QUEEN!! GOOSE BUMPS.
=
현장에서 ar깔고 라이브랑 같이했는데 엠넷 스벌 후싱크 송출 안맞게 내보내서 입모양도 부자연스러워보이는거에요 오해하지말아주세오,,, 이번에 음원 내보내기때문에 모든 그룹 ar깔고 했습니다 내일 낮12시에 나오는 한 음원 많이 들어주세요!
=
1:16 여기 연출 너무 좋다ㅜㅠ 거기다가 노래까지 너무 대박이야
=
BOM WATCHING GIDLE PROUD MOM

GIDLE WATCHING BOM AMAZED DAUGHTERS
=
At first i thought CL would do the rap part. Hahaha
=
goosebumps when cheetah came out!!!!waaaah!!! just the best!!after seeing this i can't get off my head the simple what if's....


what if we get a collab from....
-cheetah and cl
-cheetah and gd/t.o.p ..darn..bigbang! 
-cheetah and brown eyed girls/miryo at least...or just any of the members!
-cheetah and soyeon (g-idle)
-who else??! 


cheetah could be anywhere!!!
=
When she's still using the 2NE1 hand sign at the end. As a blackjack, im so emotional. I miss them.
=
춤 못추는 박봄 너무 귀엽쟈나... 사랑해요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅠ
=
This girl have amazing voice! Don’t give up girl!!! Keep go on,   Let it go what people said,  a lot fans still love you and want you come back stage!!! Please be strong, happiness!!!👍💖😍
=
1:09

그 와중에 우기 한국어 졸라 잘해...ㄷㄷ
=
3:12 the moment when hyojung  decided that bom has to be her wife😂
=
this got 5th??? seriously?!? Miss Thang aka Park Bom ATE this cover LIKE A CORN ON THE COB
=
This is the bestt omg💛
=
진짜 요즘 yg가 아쉽고 너무 실망스럽지만... 내가 가장 좋아하고 선호했던 yg 아티스트 중 한명으로써 역대급이다.. 물론 난 한이라는 원곡을 안들어봤지만 그냥 진짜 박봄 노래 같다는 생각밖에 안든다.. 박봄의 음색과 경험에서 나오는 무대 그리고 치타의 피쳐링, 진짜 치타 피쳐링도 대박이었다.. 그데 이게 5위라니 어이가없네.. 진짜 대박이다
=
That stage presence 🔥
=
This version is suit for me, I love it ❤️
=
그냥 이 프로 나오겠다고 결심한 것 자체가 고맙고 몇년차인데 아직까지도 이렇게 열심히 하는게 너무 좋다
=
Pubilshed Sept. 12, but still watching again and again.
It really looks like it's her own song 😍
Dont forget to vote our Queen in MAMA2019, she deserve the Best in Vocal Performance Solo
=
ouh her voice make me goosebumps💜
=
2NE1 were REAL sisterhood. <3
=
ohhhhh yeahhhh, the best PARK BOM!
=
Don’t let a queen cover your song ! Its will become her own song
=
I loved this performance! Bom has great stage presence!!

Can we please get Bom x CL x Minzy x Dara collab plsssss. 

Missing my girls together 😩😩
=
THE 2NE1 HANDPOSE AT THE END GOT MY CRYING REAL HARD WTFFFFFFF WTF HAPPENED WITH ONE OF MY YG FAM AAAAAAAAAAAA I WANT TO GO BACK TO THOSE TIMES MY HEART I CANNOT
=
2:55 표정 진짜 개좋아 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
와.. 6명이서 부른걸 혼자부르잖아 진짜 왕은 박봄이다
=
This sounds like her own song. That's how a great artist do it. Anything they touch is gold!
=
Let's go 10M views, BLACKJACKs!!! 🔥🔥
=
.super disappointed with the rankings bring back 2ne1 i swear they're always on top, kpop industry will be the biggest breakdown if 2ne1 reunited with blackjacks
=
I miss the whole gang
=
Her comeback must be like this,,,so upbeat
=
Omg Cheetah is Soyeon teacher when she was in PD101. And now she sang Soyeon's song. Wow Soyeon, you go girl...
=
2:54 미친거 아닌가 진짜 예쁘다
=
I really love her!!!!!!
=
PARK BOM SINGS SO GOOD ❤️❤️💖
=
เรารู้สึกคนเดียวป่ะ ว่านางหน้าตึงไปด้วยโบทอกอ่ะเลยขยับปากไม่ค่อยได้และหน้านางก็บวมมากอ่ะ
=
I bet CL cried seeing this. She misses 2ne1 a lot too...
=
As expected, from my queen! 💞
=
We love queen bom👸🏻❤️
=
Seunghee’s reaction to Bom is legit all of us 😲😲
=
우기 한국어 왤케 잘햌ㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㄱㄱㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱ ㄱㄱㅋ제스쳐도 한국인ㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㄱㄱㄱ아 무슨 내 친군 줄 알았다ㅠㅠ 슈화 잘 어우ㄹㄹㅕㄹ요도 개겹ㅠㅠ
=
이게 어딜봐서..5위인거지..진짜 매번 아쉬워하는 봄언니 얼굴보면서 억장 와르르
=
I can't.. I reeeaaaaaally love Bom's version of this song. What can I do? I just love 2ne1's music   from the start. I get too slow when it comes to other group. But. I heard the original one. And.. Wow... Tq Bom.
=
2:46초에 지호 너무 귀엽다... 근데 진짜 박봄님 쩐다 이게 5위 했다는게 애초에 말이 안됌 편곡도 자기만의 스타일로 너무 멋있게 했는데 ;;
=
My og queen on stage making my new queens (mamamoo) gawk does my heart good
=
엥 나 진짜 박봄 퀸덤무대중에 탑급으로 좋은데 5위라니ㅠㅠ
=
As G-Dragon said, every song that Park Bom lays her voice on turns to gold whether it was originally good or not. I don't make the rules 😉
=
HER "2NE1" HAND SIGN AT THE END, OMG BOM I LOVE YOU
=
omfg this was fantastic
=
노랱ㅋㅌㅌㅌㅌ진짴ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ개잘한닼ㅋㅌㅌㅌㅌ사랑해
=
2:31 지민ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ귀여워
=
Dear mnet, I dare you to open international voting. There are so many fans around the world you know. That way, you can maximize queendom. Make it global with all fans of different country determine who deserve to the throne of the queendom.
=
1:23 발음졸귀탱ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
This is just amazing. Couldn't expect any less from Bom #forever2ne1
=
Park Bom at all the haters and YG: I want you to be ruined :)
=
아 진짜 목소리 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 이래서 2ne1 아직도 못잃는겨 ,,,,, 다시 노래불러줘서 고마워 박봄 ㅠㅠ ❤️❤️ 우리한테는 무적권 1등  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
=
I watched the episode and Bom said she wanted to bring 2ne1 feels to this song, she practiced like she was a trainee again, recorded the song over 9 times, sent the song to the producer multiple times until the song was done correctly and Hann was the only song she listened to.(G) idle was hoping that she chose Hann , they said that she made the song her own , and her performance was reminiscent of when she performed with 2ne1.
=
3:02 킬링파트 ㅠㅠ 봄 넘무 멋져요오오오 ㅠㅠㅠ 완전 1등감인데 하 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
WOAH that note I expect it to be that highe
=
HER STAGE PRESENCE OMGGGG 😫😫🔥🔥
=
원곡의 생각 안 날 정도네 근데 이게 그 파합보다 더 못하다고???
=
Am i the only one watching this over and over again...
=
To be honest, I thought it was her own song. Go Park Bom 💚💚
=
2:53 언니 미소 천만불짜리 가치 그 이상의 미소 진짜 책오..
=
이때 메이크업 진짜 잘어울린다ㅠㅠ
=
2:55 언니시발졸라이뻐ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
That 2ne1 sign.. I'm tearing up.. and Bom's punch when she sings an upbeat song.
=
My queen😍😭💜
=
I soooo love Bom's version of this song :).. I never expect this to rank at  5th .. Haisst!!
=
She's back I am so happy!!!!! ☺️🤭
=
Boom, I love you! It's good to see you back!
=
I have one word.


Legendary
=
My eyes saw them on the stage.  Someday 2NE1 will standing agian  by Parkbom and Sansara
=
3:00 와 진짜 멋있다 ㄷㄷ
제스쳐 진짜 좋아
=
Now i like Hann after BOM bring this song 😍😍
=
♡ Park Bom ♡♡  2ne1 ♡
=
U know, all though I really wanted to see 2ne1 reunion here, i am kinda glad that Bom is standing her own ground here. If any of the 2ne1 members were here, I know that the bitchy Korean Netizens are all gonna be like "she is only depending on 2ne1 to get votes"or "she cant make herself stand out on her own without 2ne1 at her side."

Whether Bom wins or not, to me, she is already Queen for standing tall and slaying her stages like true legend.
=
Proof that BOM is one of the Kpop Legend! Indeed queen 👑
=
Keep streaming
=
bom 😭😭😭😭😭 your so good vocal is always amazing 😍😍😍😍😍
=
퀸덤에 박봄 나오는거 진짜 너무 좋다..
=
Its crazy to think this was a group song seeing how well bom did this as a solo. I like both but this cover gives me strong 2ne1 vibes and I'm obsessed with it. Imagine if all of 2ne1 couldve covered it together.
=
와ㅜ 박봄 댄스곡 내줬음 좋겠다ㅜ 넘 잘 어울림
=
진짜 초중고딩을함께보낸 투에니원....진짜 박봄목소리를 다시들어서 행복하면서도 이젠 추억속의 투에니원인게 슬프다
=
i thought its really her own song.. 😰
=
다 모르겟고 봄이 너무 예쁘다 무대에서 빛나는게 뭔지 보여주네.. 마지막 퉤니원싸인 ㅜ)
=
한참 후배인 아이들과 경쟁하는거면 박봄입장에서 솔직히 자존심 스크래치일 수도 있겠지만 이번을 기회로 더 많이 보고싶다...솔직히 저기서 존재감 압승임
=
QUEENBOM!!!!!
=
0:33 균형 못잡아서 지진 난거 귀엽다 ㅋ
=
is this a concert...wth. 😍😍😍😍😍 I'm liking this ver better
=
진짜 인형같다
=
She did a girl group song ALONE

She's really queen TT
=
이와중에 깨알 슈화 넘 귀엽다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
When 2ne1 perform they own every song even it is a cover song.
=
Park Bom and Cheetah 😍❤️❤️
=
아니..경연이 아니라 축하공연 수준인데..ㅋㅋ 박봄에 치타..ㅋㅋ;
=
Bom just started singing and this was a whole song owned by her, her voice definitely is unique
=
봄언닝 사랑해여...❤️
=
ㅠㅠ이런 엄청난 무대가 어째서 5위냐고ㅠㅠㅠ
=
진짜...와 그냥 소름이 쫙 끼친다...
=
그냥 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 퀸덤이 아니라..... 팬덤해 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 난 아직도 파하! 보다 낮은 이유를 모르겠어....ㅋㅋ 박봄+치타 조합이면 경연이 아니라 초청무대 급 아니야??
=
이거 뭔가 계속 생각나고 어느샌가 한을 박봄버전으로 부르고 있는 내모습을 발견하게 됨..... 진짜 완벽하게 커버했다
=
Bom still stong and cute
=
My queen parkbom ❤❤
=
후배들 양학하러 왔누 ㄷㄷ
=
Queen ❤
=
Cant help but watching this over and over again.this song was so addicted bcz of park bom's voice!!
=
I’m a neverland but I really think Bom did quite a good job here. 5th was a bit.... exaggerated. I think she should have at least gotten 3rd or 4th
=
Jenny still got it!! Yaas Queen!
=
03:00 제스쳐 뭔데 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ큐ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
난진짜갠적인 생각으로  원곡보다 훨씬 좋다
=
BOM's voice is another level 😍😍😍 #forever2ne1 #foreverBlackJack
=
OMG she killed it !!! Omg that’s so awesome !!!! She’s awesome and still a Queen !!! Congrats !
=
queen park bom lengedary
=
2:31 giving me unpretty rapstar vibes....... jimin vs cheetah lol
=
a QUEEN INDEED
=
Soyeon reaction reminded me of pd101😭
=
2:22 와 치타님 와;; 아니.... 와; 딴사람한테 치이고 가네 우와,....와;;;
=
4:11 😭😭
=
CL Dara Minzy are you guys watching this? Bom is here waiting for you. Blackjacks are all here waiting for our Queens!
=
1:23  뜬금없는데 슈화 너무 귀여ㅜㅁ
=
You are amazing ❣️
=
이무대가 5위 라는것부터 이해 않감
한참 대선배 인데
=
와 소름이 쫙 올라와..
=
YAS THE OLD PARK PARK BOM IS BACK!
her stage presence isn’t a joke
LIKE if you were reminded of ‘I am the Best’ when she did the punch
=
Bom babyyyyy <3 she killed this!!! so much respect
=
Hwasa 😂
=
근데 진짜 자기노래같네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
진짜..... 실력은 그대로다 ㅠㅠㅜㅠㅠ 눈물 날라 그럼
=
혼자라서 돋보인다
엄청 굵은 줄기의 새빨간 장미같다
가시도 엄청 날카로울 것 같고 굉장히 매혹적이랄까
=
박봄님 완전이쁘고 노래도 진짜 잘 부르심♥♥
=
갓봄 사랑해 ㅜㅜ
=
I came back to her again because of that addictive vocals... 😍😍😍😍😍
=
park bom❤️❤️❤️
=
Kpop Community will be SHOOKT If Girl's Generation and 2NE1 will comeback
=
이거 진심 시청자 40 서로 투표 50해야함
=
Wow.. It seems like she owns that song.. 💯 🔥 That's the True Queen.. 👑
=
박봄님 음색 지려버리는 와중에 1:06 민니님 발장구치는거 개귀여워 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
to be honest I like this version!!!!!!veryyyyy muchhhhhhh
=
누가 이거보고 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 박봄 한은 진짜 다시 남자가 찾아오면 죽여버릴거같다고 ㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
아니 난이해가 안가는게 박봄이 저런얘들이랑 대결할 짬 은 아닌듯
=
아이들 노랜긴하지만 진짜 박봄이랑 찰떡이다
=
Park Bom is an authentic artist
=
It keeps me smiling 😁😍
=
이 채널 잘 모르지만 박봄 팬층이 저기서 콘서트 볼 나이들이 아니여서  수딸려소 5위인듯 너무 원통하다 봄언니가 5위라니 저 목소리를 듣고 5위라니
=
Bom, I love you💕😍
=
박봄님 너무 멋있어요 ㅠㅠ 포즈 완전 지려요 중독성 너무 오져서 진짜 계속 보러와요 ㅠㅠ
=
I really like this stage. I think this was my fave bom stage on queendom.
=
진짜 편곡 엄청 잘하셔서 처음 들었을때 적어도 3등이실줄알았는데..
=
Have y’all noticed the 2NE1 sign at her very last pose??? Hello!!!
=
Please vote for mama 2019
=
You did very well  ♠️💘
=
That hand sign~~~ OMG !!! I really miss 2ne1 😭😭😭
=
🤟🏻2ne1 ❤️
=
*LIKE BOM IS PROVING HERE 2NE1 IS THE QUEEN OF GIRL CRUSH! LIKE ROOKIES SEE THIS!!*
=
I love her really !
=
Is her performance for ENL,,Next week?
=
아 언니 너무 보고싶었어여 ㅜㅠㅠ
=
It's like it's her own song wow! That's a new level of GOLD! 💛
=
진짜 혼자서 이 무대를 빈틈없이 꽉 채운다는 것부터 대단한 거임..
박봄이라 가능했던 거
=
아닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 3:11 완전 내 표정 ㄹㅇㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
She owned the song :)
=
I love 2NE1 & Park Bom 💕💕
But I felt like she doesn't feel comfortable dancing as much or is a lil awkward so she didn't place well in Queendom 😭
=
Wawa preciosa 💕💕💕💕 te amo
=
Queendom Mnet can YOU PLEASE OPEN THE VOTINGS FOR INTERNATIONAL FANS too?!?! So we can support our Queen Bom too. Let's be honest here. This million views isn't from knetizens only. Also you did it to MAMA 2015 CAN YOU reunite 2NE1 members THIS TIME TOO AGAIN?!? Jebal
=
This is was favorite performance of bom 😍😍😍
=
She can perform any song like its her own, yeorobun she is our PARK BOM!!💖
=
QUEENS CHEETAH AND BOM 👑
=
Her performance deserves to be in the first place, it was so freaking good !
=
와 박봄 안죽은듯 원곡생각이 전혀 1도안나는 소화력
=
One of my favourite performances on Queendom. Not surprised it’s almost at 10 million views!
=
This song was brought up from a six to a TEN !!!!!!!!!
=
박봄이 중독성 오지는 후렴 널잊으리라 우우우~~~ 할줄 알고 들어왔는데 한번 해주지ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow... 🔥🔥🤘🔥🔥
=
박봄 음색 정말 독보적이다. 솔직히 이 곡을 이렇게 자기 것으로 잘 소화해낼 줄 몰랐음. 이 프로그램 출연하는 게 부담됐을 법도 하지만 결과적으로 박봄에게 정말 좋은 기회인 것 같고 마지막 투애니원 싸인땜에 눈물난다 ㅜㅜ
=
순위에 상관없이 자꾸 레전드 무대만 뽑아주는 아티스트들에게 진짜 박수쳐주고 싶다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
2:34 jimin 😂
=
2:23 치타 표정 지린다...
=
목소리 진짜 매력적이야
=
IMAGINE IF 2NE1 REUNION AS OT4 AGAIN FOR THE LAST TIME KPOP GIRL GROUPS CANT RELATE

EDIT: THANKS FOR THE LIKES #BLACKJACKFOREVER
=
Keep streaming
=
그와중세 치타님 랩을 굉장히 여유있게 하시는데 왠만한 말 빠른 래퍼들보다 훨씬 좋다ㅜㅜ
=
Why does she sound different? 
It sounds like she can't breathe
Not what I was expecting
=
와 미친 노래랑 무대 개좋아... you~할때 개소름 돋아 ㅠㅠㅠ 음색 미챴다 진짜... 역시 박봄인가 개레전드네...
=
Even if Bom doesn’t win the show, the show is really giving her great exposure and she’s getting back into being on TV. Since her comeback the media has given her lots of positive attention and she’s been really successful! Lots of people were waiting for her grand return. She’s really a superstar, Blackjack and Bomshell forever ❤️
=
3:12 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
난 원작이 더 좋긴한대 취향 차니까
=
Wuaahh just bom herself can make girlgroup's song just like her own n her vibe like... no offense i like this version tho wkwk
=
봄언니 개멋있어ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 내일 셤인데 봄언니만 보는거 정상이죠ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I’m not kidding for the first time I thought she’s performing her own song....!!! 
Edit: thanks for liking my comments ❤️
=
why not minzy to rap 🥺
=
10M is close, let's support our queen bomshells/blackjackies
=
hands down to the effortless QUEEN💖 she's just chillin but still kill it🔥 Her natural amazing unique voice tho🖤🔥 SHE'S THE BADDEST🔥
=
lol mamamoo's reactions are litEarAllY mEee
=
I still hate how YG ruined  2NE1 when its obvious they are the IT girls
=
치타 진짜 목소리 너무 예쁘다...고혹적이야
=
왁악악~!!치타쌤 이닦!!!
=
2:55 와
=
Woaahhh she really brought the queen in queendom ♥️♥️♥️
=
PARK BOM REALLY GIVES OFF A UNIQUE VIBE THAT YOU CANT FIND ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
=
박봄누나 이런컨셉으로 음반내면 좋겠다 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
와 음색은 진짜 독보적이다...
=
Her voice is the best.i love bom
=
2:22 어쩌겠다고 뭔가 멋짐
=
랩파트에 씨엘이 나왔다면 진짜 레전드중에 레전드 됐을듯,,,,ㅠㅠ 퉤니원이 넘 그립 ㅠ
=
cheetah was so amazing
=
전설의 걸그룹 메인보컬 클라스 ㄷㄷㄷ
=
I'm here. AGAIN. 😂
=
3:12 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
박봄 계속순위권 왜낮은거임 존나잘하는대 에휴 짜증 압살하고계시는대 순위졸라어이없네
히트곡경연때는 마이크음질이상하더니
=
이 노래 부르고 나서 정신이 하나도 없어서 머리 위해 두 손 올려서 왕관 만들라고 했는데 한 손 올렸다고 :) 
그 와중에 2NE1 안 잊은거는 마음 깊이 박혀있는거다 진심이
=
너무멋있어....!!!!♥
=
Hwasa was shooketh to the core
=
02:17 치타부분 미쳤다 !
=
Soyeon's scream when she saw Cheetah😍 She must be so proud. The song that she wrote was sung by a legend together with her previous mentor😍 (If I'm not mistaken, Cheetah was her mentor during PD101 and she was entitled that time as Cheetah's daughter because of he rap) 

And damn, Bom is on fire!🤘 She literally changed the vibe of the song! That was great! As a NEVERLAND, I applaud her! The best!💜
=
와 진짜 미쳣다 진짜이건 경연이아니라 걍 개인콘서튼인듯 개지린다 진짜ㅠㅜㅜ
=
Hwasa admires Park Bom!!! ❤️
=
There were a different story if all of 2ne1 member come out
=
bom💚💚💚💚💚💚
=
퀸덤이 박봄 싫어하나?5위는 너무하잖어
=
2:31 손에 있는 빵 맛있겠다
=
she did very well and amazing job
=
박봄 음색은 정말...뒤늦게 박봄 팬 됐다.
=
마마에서 채린이랑 해줘..
=
Pls bring back 2ne1!!! It’s like she’s doing this one alone vs an entire army!
=
Amazing as always bon
=
아 박봄 귀엽다... 왤케 귀엽노 마지막에 너무 깜찍하다용
=
나는이 표지를 좋아한다! 이거 정말 아름답다! 박봄을 좋아합니다! 너무 예뻐요 ~~~ 💞
=
솔까 원곡보다 좋음ㅋ
=
아무리 편곡했다지만 보컬 여러명이 부르는걸 혼자 다 소화하는데 이게 진짜 퀸 아니냐ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 갠적으로 씨엘이랑 같이 하는무대도 보고싶다ㅠㅠㅠ마지막 손동작도 그렇고 그냥 투애니원 자체가 보고싶다
=
아 언니 진짜 사랑해 진짜 너무 예뻐요 언니...
=
한 좋아하는 곡인데 박봄이 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ치타가 피처링???? 이걸 왜 이제 봤지ㅠㅜ
=
Bom se siente más segura de si misma🤗
=
와 여왕님 같다 진짜
=
진짜 짬바 무시 못한다 격렬한 춤이나 이펙트 있는 퍼포먼스 없이 무대를 걸어다니고 살짝살짝 안무하면서 오직 노래실력과 음색으로만 무대를 장악하는게..진짜 퀸임..분위기도 표정연기도... 이정도면 그냥 내가 퀸이다 하고 나온 것 같아...
=
*me weeks later still shooketh that the guest wasn't CL*
=
이 쯤 되면 투표하는 관객들 눈을 의심하게 된다...
=
I dunno but I really like her version 😍😍
=
Thats my bomieee
=
I didn't see any comment about it but at 4:10 she's making the 2NE1 hand gesture... my heart TT
=
i dont care about rankings and stuff. i just want to see my queen. thats all. coz no matter what they do, bom is bom. a legend. and no one can ever beat that. 😈
=
몰랐는데 언니 엄청 예쁘네ㅠㅠㅠ 왜 얼굴가지고 말들었던겨????? 이해안가넹
=
이건 1위 해야지..
=
와 이거지
=
If one of the 2ne1 showed up here, i swear to god that she is going to be always first
=
박봄 순위 이해가 안됩니다.
진짜 박봄때문에 보는데...
=
아...진짜 박봄이라는 가수 정말 유우~~~~워어어어~~~~
=
just 1/4 of 2NE1, imagine the quartet performing
=
박봄 음색 특이해서 너무 좋음 
다시는 아이돌에서는 나오지 못할 음색
=
와근데 목관리 잘한것도 대단한데..
=
진짜 소화력대박
=
(치타 등장)
전소연: 치타쌤이다!!!!!!!
지민: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
This song really suits with her, rock it park BOM❤️
=
박봄은 근데 진짜 그냥 자기 노래 부르는거 보는 것 같음....다들 어쩔 수 없이 원곡이 생각나는데 박봄은 걍 이거 자기 노래같아...

+이게 왜 5등임 장난치나 나는 이게 적어도 3등 이상일줄 알았어.....;
=
아진짜 노래중독된다ㅜㅜ너무좋아요
=
Legend never die.....
=
치타,박봄 진짜 너무 좋아하는 아티스트들의 콜라보구나ㅜㅜ넘넘 좋다
=
아 진짜 잘햇는데 ㅠㅠ넘 멋잇다 박봄
=
아니 이 무대가 럽리보다 낮은게 말이되냐고




종이비행기님 오토튠은 마이크에 넣는게 아니라 mr에 보컬 교정,왜곡용으로 넣는거예요 저번 무대에선 마이크 송신불안이랑 mr딜레이로 방송사고 난거 같아요 참고로 전 음향 엔지니어링 학교 다니고 있구요 아는척하실려고 영어 쓰신 거   같은데 죄송해요
=
3:23 와.............
=
진짜 순위보고 기겁을 했다 러블리즈는 편곡도 아닌 그냥 장기자랑 수준으로 경연을 했는데 자기노래처럼 편곡을 한 박봄에게 4위해줘야하는게맞는거 아닌가 이해가 안간다 진짜 어느누구보다도 여유있고 잘하고 그랬는데 진짜 어이없다 두고보자 퀸덤
=
one of the QUEENS.. 👑👑👑👑
=
ゲストすご笑笑
=
다른 팀들은 팀원들이랑 하니까 든든하고 뭔가 화이팅도 되는데 박봄은 아무리 대선배여도 혼자서 한다는게...되게 힘든건데 씩씩하게 잘해나가는모습이 보기조타아!!!!잘됏으면좋겟당👍👏👏
=
ALL OF THE GIRLS DID AMAZING FOR THEIR COVERS AND.I LOVE THEM ALL BUT LIKE SHIT YALL PARK BOM CAME THROUGH
=
한번볼땐 몰랐는데 두번째보니 자기만의 매력이 잘 살아있게 편곡한듯
=
hwasas reaction, she really idolises bom 😂😂😂
=
I need a studio version from this
=
You know a single woman owns the stage when she can pull out a group song by just herself. I love her so much.
=
The Queen. She is amazing!!😻
=
그저 웃음만 나온다 할때 너무 이뽀...
=
러블리즈 보다 순위 낮은거 실화냐ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ어이가 없어서 멍때리게 되네
=
오ㅏ우!!ㅋㅋㅋㅋ너무멋져♥
=
여자아이들 한은 조용하게 자기한테 돌아오지말라고 하는거 같고 박봄 한은 진짜 다시 돌아가면 죽여버릴꺼같은 느낌임ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
이무대 3등정도 할줄 알았는데 파압보다 아래네 시발 봄이 언니 기분은 어또켔노
=
I’m screaming all the video I’m not kidding park bom is perfect I’m crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
와 개미쳤다 언니 사랑해요
=
Yeah, my queen did that. 🔥
=
All those people saying “she can’t dance” like gurl please.. following the choreography is not her thing cuz she PERFORMS! That’s the dancer jobs to dance while she sings and performs.
=
you!!!!할때 진짜 소름.....
=
Cheeta💫💫💫
=
Keep streaming
=
What A powerful voice!! 👏🏻👏🏻
=
Whoa... She just turned another gg's song into a genre of her own...
=
그녀는 무대에서 위대하다
=
이게 순위가 낮다고..ㅋㅋ
이 정도로 순위조작이 티나는데 아예 숨길 생각이 없는거 아닌지..^^
=
최근 박봄이 옛날처럼 빛나네요 ㅠ
=
Its feel like her own concert
=
What would have happened if she'd called CL.
=
Ok I love this remix but I do wish that in the beginning she sings a little more clearly but in the end it was still PERFECT
=
미친 아이들은 뱀느낌났었는데 박봄은  존나 악마같다 진짜 개쩐다..
=
역시 암넷은 기대를 져버리지않고 암걸리는 짓을 하넿ㅎㅎㅎㅎ역싷ㅎㅎㅎㅎ암넷 개싫어
=
진짜 무대도 노래도 컨셉도 박봄도 다 진짜 미친듯이 좋은데 약간 립싱크 하는게 조금 티나서 진짜 1퍼센트 아쉬웠음 그래도 박봄 넘나리 조하 앞으로 활동 많이 하쟈ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Not a huge park bom stan but I honestly respect her for going in with her solo career like ageism is a real thing in music industry especially for women so for her to keep doing what she loves HATS OFF REALLY
=
봄 내스타일♡♡ 목소리 매력있음
=
뽀미누나 눈화장 치명적이여 ㅠㅠ
=
마지막에 손으로 2NE1 한거 아시죠?캬ㅠ
=
Omg she's make me cry
=
퀸덤에 나온 박봄의 용기에 박수를...ㅠㅠ 혼자 솔로로 나오는게 쉬운 일이 아니었을텐데.. 보면 볼수록 투에니원 완전체가 너무 보고싶어진다ㅠ
=
니노래내꺼스킬 시전
=
TRUE LEGEND MATERIAL YES PARK BOMMMM
=
솔까 2Ne1 팬덤은 어마어마한데 박봄 혼자여서 실력보다는 팬덤으로 승부하는 거여서 슬픔ㅠ
=
어이가없네 박봄언니가 5위라고?! 실화냐?
=
OMG! 2NE1 sign in the end makes me cry. Missing them. 😭😭😭
=
Dont forget to vote for Park Bom at MAMA she's nominated at 3 categories.💚
=
I almost pass out thinking CL could be her guest. Damn. Guess I have dreamed too much
=
와미쳤다너무멋있다ㅠㅠㅠ찢었구만소름돋았어
=
Park Bom, fighting!
=
암넷 인데 멀 믿음. 박봄 꽃길걷자
=
이 언니 웃는 거 너무 예쁘고 그냥 퀸이고 아니 진짜 언니 사랑해요 그냥 사랑해
=
우리의 투애니원돌려줘....얼ㄹ엉ㅇ얼ㄹ우ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠ
=
Park BOM bring back 2ne1 vibe makes me cry😭🌹
=
개오졌다,, 원곡느낌 죽이지도 않으면서 박봄 스타일 제대로 녹여냄...아이들 애들한테 배운 학춤도 잘 살려주고 ㅠㅠ크으 내가 아이들멤버면 진짜 고마웠을듯 편곡 지대로고 봄언니 음색 개오졌고 치타 섭외한거 미쳤고 걍 개오짐
=
치타라뇨 ㅈㄴ 반칙이잖아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
i love this so much
=
00:59 so true 😱😱😱😱
=
포스가 다름....
....그래 퀸덤 식스센스 무대 바로 보고왔다....ㅋㅋㅋ
=
If 2NE1 made a comeback in this show,Im sorry but others group just done and whole Music Industry will shaking again
=
Beautiful inside out Park Bom!!! 🥰💚💚💚🥰
=
퀸덤은 거의 레전드만 만들어내는 것 같음
=
편곡 너무 좋은데.. 이게 왜 5윕니까ㅠㅠ
=
이날 진심 레전드 ㅎㄷㄷ...
봄언니 진심 늘 이쁜데 이날 더 예뻤음 !!
=
MNET is so lucky to have a 2NE1 member performing again in their channel. PARK BOM is a legend.
=
Did anyone else notice how she changed her peace sign at the end to a 2NE1 hand sign? Just me?
=
Yes, I see you. I know is you. I can do nothing. Just look and sigh. And go away again.
=
3-4위 무대인디.. 절대로 하위권이 아닌디   ㅠㅠ
=
아니 파합이 이걸 어떻게 이기냐고
=
와 원래 박봄노래같음 ㄹㅇ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ봄이가 아예 지꺼로 만들어 벌임 ㅎㄷㄷ
=
2:14 you do note di mo kami maloloko. 😅
=
i thought CL.. I want CLLLLLL
=
마지막에 엔딩포즈가 너무좋다...
=
첨들었을때 이노래가 박봄노래인줄;;; 연륜이란 이래서 무서운건가보다.. 디테일이!
=
Park Bom served Visuals , high fashion ,talent and charisma.
=
ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 박봄이 만약 약국에 남아있었다면 씨엘 피처링 쌉가능이었을지도.. 치타도 짱좋았지만 그냥 뭔가 퉤니원 멤버끼리 뭉쳐있는게 보고싶다ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
ㅍㅏ합~😘 정신승리한 러블리즈 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Black jacks 
Bom will come back this Friday ( 25 October )
At 6 pm 
With her new single 
She will perform this song in " Queen Dom " show 
Let's support her ❤
=
그래 다 인정 할게 근데 저게 러블리즈 파합 보다 낮은게 말이나 되냐고
=
Cheetah sings her trainees song and slay it 🔥
Soyeon looks so happy when she see Cheetah 🙂
=
음색 독보적이다
=
와.. 황제같아...
=
퀸덤 레전드 무대 원곡보다 조은 것
박봄 멋져! 박봄 굿럭!
=
박봄 한 노래방에 있음 좋겟다 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
이정도면 1위 아닌가ㅠㅠ 박봄님이 솔로이신데다가 거의 혼자 모든 파트를하고 완전 꽉채운거 같은데.. 1위진짜 충분했을텐데ㅠ 넘 아쉽 ㅠ 그리고 난 이걸 몇번이나 돌려보고있는건지 ㅋㅋ
=
실력으로 줄세우기였으면 앞줄인건 확실 그냥 프로그렘과 안 맞았다고 봐야지
=
아 진짜 1일 5영상 한다 진짜... 언니.... 너무 사랑해요 눈빛부터 미치겠는데 학춤출 때 미칠거 같애 제 마음의 1등은 항상 박봄 은니애오ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Bom , I am happy u r here again! 
All of the support for u!
=
퀸덤 스토리 영상에서 댓 봤는데 2:55 그저 웃음만 나온다 에서 손 올라갈때 입꼬리도 같이 올라가는거,,,너무 이쁘잖아
=
일단 프로그램명 퀸덤말고 팬덤으로 바꾸자 그럼 무슨 결과가 나와도 다 수긍함
=
Park bom's best performance in quendom 😘
=
2ne1 fingers at the endddddde! Heart this for 2ne1
=
편집도 치타도 다 멋진데 일단 그룹리 부르는 노래를 피처링만두고 소화하는게 대단함 그것도 라이브로...
=
박봄 귀여워
=
현장은 생라이브였다는데ㅜㅜㅜㅜ왜 싱크를 이상하게 내보내서 립싱크처럼 보이게하나요...아진심 엠넷...담엔 제발 똑바로...ㅂㄷ
=
치타 등장 할 때마다 너무 멋있어서 침흘리면서 봐ㅠㅠ 언니ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I love you bom , pls come back 2ne1
=
이악물고 부른 최고의보컬이 파압~ 에 밀리는 아이러니... 참ㅋㅋ
=
도대체 어떻게 이 무대가 파하압😘 보다 순위가 왜 낮지? 5위가 말이냐ㅠㅠ
=
It's kinda sad how kids and new kpop fans
doesn't know who 2NE1, Girl's Generation, Kara, SHINee, Super Junior, TVXQ, CNBLUE, Tara, 4minute, After School, Psy, Rain, BoA, BIG BANG, MBLAQ, BEAST,  Wonder Girls, IU, Davichi, Fiestar, Sistar, Miss A, Secret etc. is
=
솔로가 그룹 상대로 대결하기 진짜 불리한데 실력으로 발라버림.....
=
엠넷은 하도 들은 조작 얘기가 많아서 순위는 믿고 거르는데 아무리 그래도 이런 개쩌는 무대가 러블리즈보다 아래인 건 좀 많이 기분 나쁘다 엠넷아...
=
Goosebumps is everywhere !!!
=
박봄님 너무 좋아요~~퀸덤에서 보고.
옛날 노래부터 계속 듣고 있어요~~
멋짐~~~
=
She didn't arrange the song. She recreated it like a legend. She is one of the Queens of K-pop.
=
すげえ、
死ぬほど聴いた原曲忘れた。
懐かしい、めちゃくちゃに2ne1のスタイル。好き。
=
화사 그렇지 뭐임ㅋㅋㅋ
=
치타도 진짜 겁나 좋고 진짜 좋아하는 래퍼인데 만약에 씨엘나왔으면 진짜 펑펑 울었을듯 왠지 모르는데 약간 내 학창시절은 2NE1이여서 그런가
=
박봄 혼자하는건데 무대가 꽉차보인다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
이건 2ne1완전체가 아니라 박봄 혼자여서 다른 그룹들이 그나마 비빌수있는거였다.....완전체면 그냥 콘서트,,,,
=
Lleguemos a los diez millones 👏👏👏❤️
=
Mucho, mucho, muchooooo apoyo  para Bom 🙌🏽❤️👑
=
와 와 감탄만 박봄님 ㅠ.ㅠ
=
소연(님)은 스승님을...
=
아이들이랑 느낌 확 다르네요. 치타님도 좋았지만 박봄님 만으로도 무대 꽉 차요. 역시 관록이 남달라. 다른 가수들 무대 할때 잡히는 모습은 쓸쓸해 보이는데 무대에서만은 그런 느낌 전혀 없네요. 근데 풀샷으로 잡아주세요. 박봄씨가 춤을 춘다구요.
=
gosh! An amazing performance by Park Bom and its only ranked 5th?! So unfair...Queendom's ranking is ridiculous.
=
다시봐도 멋있어...이게 어캐 5위임... 솔직히 순위가 무의미한 무대임 시간이 지나고 보면 더 멋있다 후...
=
아재피셜 룰라 투투 나왔는데 이선희 경쟁구도 느낌이랄까 ㅜㅜ..  목소리 독보적임
=
와 박봄 진짜 너무멋있어!!!최고야!!!짜릿해!!!!!
=
Bom gives this song her 2ne1 vibe.  Im so proud of her. Also cheetah is one of a kind im so glad she helped our bom unnie. Im hoping a full 2ne1 members for the final stage.
=
여기서 치타쌤에게 입덕했습니다...
=
내 마음속의 1위는 언니예요... ❤️
=
이게 5위라고?? 말도 안돼!!
겁나 카리스마에 춤 노래 다되는데? 최고다 박봄~!
=
와 진짜 좋다
=
아이들 노래 느낌이 하나도 안남 진짜 박봄 노래같아짐
=
Some talents are never forgotten ! 2NE1 is one of them !
=
벌써 연말 시상식하는줄 ㄷㄷ
=
I want cl for rap
=
음색이 최고다 박봄노래는 믿고듣는 노래. 노래가어떻든 박봄이뷰르면 최고의 노래
=
Cheetah (Soyeons mentor in Unpretty rapstar season 3) doing Soyeons rap on a version by Bom in a show where Soyeon is in competition.......WOW
=
Much much better if it sang live...😍😍😍
Love you my Queen...😍😍
=
خوش تغني بس بلكوه تفتح حلكها 😂🤑 🖤🖤🖤
=
다른애들노래는 귀에 확~~~~오는게없는데
박봄 노래하는 곡들은 내 귀가 호강함
 박봄 최고!!!!!!앞으로도 좋은 노래 들려주세용 화이팅♡
=
She really nailed this version,  keep coming back to watch this!  Although disappointed with Mnet for not giving her a special award for being the only legendary soloist here, but like the saying goes, she who sings last, sings the longest and forever! Bom's here to stay!💪🤞💖
=
와 편곡 진짜 오진다 완전 다른 노래같은데 다른대로 또 좋음!!
박봄 보컬도 묵직한데 치타랩도 요염하고 묵직해서 합이 딱 맞는것같아요 역시 클래스는 어디 안간다 ㄷㄷ
=
*cheetah appears*
soyeon: IT‘S TRAINER CHEETAH!!!
”everyone is so excited by cheetah‘s appearance*
jimin: *lowkey triggered*
=
여자아이들중에한명왜자꾸침묵하는거임?
=
Cheetah doing her trainees rap😭
=
내맘속에 1등 솔직히 다들 팀플인데 박봄만 혼자 진짜 박봄 솔로곡같음 계속듣고싶다
여기에 CL있으면 게임끝 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아이돌들이 치타나오는거보고 치타쌤이라고 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
박봄이 어케 5위야 ;;;; 파합 거리는애들이 어케 더잘함....?
=
yes. she is solo. i think it was so goooood cause she is bringing the song alone by herself:( 

the result have to be better...
=
똥싸면서 보는데 너무감격해서 응가가안나옴
=
I shivered. When Cheetah appearance
=
호불호가 갈릴 수도 있는데, 목소리 하나는 진짜 독보적인 것 같다. 진짜 다른 사람 노래도 본인 노래같고, 오히려 독보적이기 때문에 호불호가 갈릴 수가 있을지도...주먹 4번날린거 같은데 커엽누ㅋ ㅋㅋ
=
박봄 ㄱh잘한ㄷr...
=
러블리즈무대가 박봄무대보다 순위 앞선다고?ㅋㅋㅋ말이야 똥이야 진짜 구라치지말자 진짜 현장 팬덤 내새꾸 우쭈쭈 하면서 화력발사한게 실력이랑 무슨 상관있냐 다들 양심좀;;
=
Omg bom such a great voice but dat face looks much bloated,make up artist doesnt really do a good job here.
=
커버끝장이다,,,,원곡도 좋지만 이 한 듣다가 원곡들으면 심심하게 들려서 다시 돌아온다구욧,,,, 이 한이 너무 자극적이엇어욧....
=
박봄 안죽었다 ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ 전설이 나왔네 ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ 한이란 노래를 몇번밖에 안듣긴 했는데 봄언니가 한으로 컴백한거같은덷ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ
=
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
3:01 you 보러옴
=
my gay heart :(((((((((
=
박봄님 무대 진짜 잘 하셨고 너무  멋지셨어요 완전 5위라는 순위 자체가 안 어울리시고 그냥 순위를 찍는 것 자체가 좀 그렇다고 생각합니다 그리고 이 프로는 암넷이고 ㅈ제이인 것도 알아요 근데 마마무가 왜 1위냐, 저것도 주작이겠지 ㅉ 이런 반응은 제발... 6년동안 열심히 쌓아온 팬덤이고 6년동안 아니 그보다도 더 갈고 닦은 실력이에요...ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
와.. 근데 박봄 음색이 진짜 특별하긴 하다. 아이들 애들도 음색 다 독보적인편인데 박봄이 부르니까 무슨 마법같음..
=
Lmao I was like she kinda looks like someone from 2ne1 but then I’m like WTH ITS BOM I MISS HER💕
=
아진짜 눈물나 나 왜이렇게 기쁘냐
=
애초에 나머지는 다 그룹인데 진짜 혼자서 솔로로 도전한다는게 와...
=
The male fan at the beginning is literally me
=
무대 찢어놓던 실력 어디 안갔다 박봄 짱
=
아니 퀸덤은 노래로가 아니라 팬들 수로 올라감
=
아무리 봐도 You! 하는 부분 쾌감오져
=
버클리 음대 나와서 지금 보컬 트레이닝도 하고 있는 사람이 현직 아이돌이랑 같이 나외서 대결하는데 5위가 진짜 말이냐 당장 심사위원해도 모자를 판인데
=
STOP talking about 2NE1! This is about Park Bom and she has proven she can manage the STAGE! #BomSquad
=
Even in her 30s, she still is the Bom from when I’ve known. Strong and power. Ages or hiatus did no harm to her. God bless Bom!!!! Bomshell and Blackjack until forever!!!
=
Love it so muchhhhhhhhhhh 😭😭😭
=
봄 혼자서도 저정돈데 투애니원 완전체 나왓음 겜 끝남
=
진짜 개이뻐
=
박봄님 진짜잘하셔서 1위하실줄 알았는데....ㅠ
=
So desperate to see 2ne1 is together on this stage. Bom’s voice is bringing back so much 2ne1 memories!
=
Bommie the Queen
=
진짜 목소리중독성오지네
=
잘한다 😍
=
오늘도 1일 1봄!
=
2 million in just 20 hrs? now that's something. It also shows how much we miss Bom and 2ne1..
=
그 누가 뭐라해도 박봄이 최고에요!
박봄 사랑해요!
=
기품있는 한마리의 백조같다
=
Still can't move on from this performance. It's obvious people loves her to sing and perform this kind of genre.
=
어우 봄언니 닭살 제조기.... 팔뚝 찌릿찌릿
=
Park Bom voice is one of the most memorable in kpop, I won't lie I liked 2NE1 song just because of her unique voice
=
개잘해 언니 멋있으면 다 언니랬어요 사랑해
=
몇번을다시보러오는건지 ㅜㅜ흑흑 너무이쁘고노래도너무좋고 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
박봄 최고다..
=
You guys keep on saying that it would be better if 2ne1 comes eventhough its a good thing but damn the competition will be over... Have mercy😂😂
=
편곡 완전잘함...그냥 자기노래로 만들었네 발음같은것도 기존노래랑 다르게 자기식으로 끊어발음..진짜 짬에서 나오는게 있구나 싶다.독보적임
=
Born to be shine
I think she's a little bit dissing Jennie. Look at her coreo and outfit.
(Black what? 😂) WHAT A QUEEN
=
I miss 2NE1 so much...!
=
your single performance =all others group performances
you just nailed it
=
She will be my queen forever
=
봐도봐도 계속 보고싶네
=
She is Queennnnnnnn!!!!
=
치타 도입부 소름 돋는다 ㄷㄷ
=
This is how you perform! She takes a risk and does her thing. She doesn't follow the CD to the T!! YES QUEEN!!! ❤❤❤
=
I don’t care if she win or be on first place all I care is that sees regaining her confidence and she’s back. She performs solo in a group competition in that case only her single presence can occupy 6-8 members of People in that reason alone she is a literary queen
=
보컬 독보적이네
=
박봄 언니 언니예쁜 사랑해요 모두
=
이제까지 못 느꼈는데 목소리 너무 좋다
=
her voice😍😍
=
Mnet.. Do you want high higher and higherrrrrrrrrr rating? Pls just need to bring 2NE1 on stage again.. everything let them cover 🔥🔥🔥
=
Still in love with her voice and her. Can anyone tell me where I can watch the entire season?  I wanna see Bom again. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
=
CL can’t come cos Mnet and YG...
=
CHEETAH!!!
=
이무대가 개인적으론 2~3위였다고 생각함
오마걸이 컨셉이 대박이었고 이 무대 보컬톤 좋았음
=
If 2NE1 comeback, they gonna end all the girl gps careers.
=
그 누구보다 봄이가 제일 예쁘다, 2ne1 다시 돌아와줬으면 좋겠다 그 누구보다 잘할텐데
=
이게 어떻게 5위냐고...
=
박봄 혼자 2ne1 해버린 무대👍👍
=
박봄 쓸수있는 전략 다 쓴거같은데 순위 5위인거면 앞으로도 높은 순위 받기 힘들듯..
원곡자에게 맡긴 끝내주는 편곡 + 치타 찬스 + 투애니원 암시 다 했는데 이 성적인거면..
=
약간 원래 한은 이별을 하는 소녀의 곡이였다면

박봄은 여왕이 남자를 차버리는 것 같음 

++++


(이게 뭐라고 좋아요를 이렇게 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 감사합니다.)
=
this not even half of 2ne1, what a queennnn❤
=
Please vote Park Bom for MAMA she nominated in 3 categories
=
밤봄 의상 머리스턀 움직이는 마네킹인줄  치타도 포스지리고 멋지넹
=
박봄진짜 잘하고있는데... 순위권 왜 아래인지 그리고 급차이부터가 틀린데... 박봄 1위 맨날해라 ~♥️
박♥️봄 사랑해요♥️
=
저 무대가 5위라고? 투표 방식이 너무 팬들중심으로 편중되어있으니 저러지;;
=
박봄 너무 잘부른다...!!!
=
문자 투표도 해라 이게 어떻게 5위??
=
난 진짜 1등일꺼라고 생각했습니다.
=
내가 이거 대체 몇 번 돌려보고 있게요....
봄언니 영원한 나의 1등....
=
What I like about her performances is the fact that you can tell they're completely live (Mamamoo's performances are live too). But in her case she's alone and she has to sing the entire song alone, so I respect that a lot.
=
Keep streaming
=
Keep streaming
=
양현석이 그들을 담기 너무 더러웠을뿐..ㅠㅠ 봄언니 하고싶은거 다해
=
I knoe cheetah will come and I'm still surprised
=
낮은 순위를 받을 노래가 아닌데ㅠ 현장 팬 수의 차이인지 왤케 낮냐ㅠ
=
Keep streaming
=
I love this concept SO MUCH♥️😭😍😍😍😍
=
When see her I want cry...  fighting Park Bom ❤
=
박봄사랑해~~
=
Bom singing a fast tempo song
Cheetah gave me goosebumps 
Bom having choreography 
Bom doing 2NE1 sign at the end
BOM breathes fast at the end coz she’s been like “ why did i chose a fast song?” HAHAHAHAHA
=
그녀는 어떻게 1 등을 얻지 못했습니까? 문제가 있습니다.
=
완전 박봄 노래로 만들었네 몇번 듣는지 굿굿
=
여기에 CL만 같이 나왔어도 씹어먹었다
=
AMAZING
=
다 리메이크한거 티나는데 박봄은 가장 자기노래같당
=
Queen?
YES
=
Keep streaming
=
와 허수아비 보고 소름돋아서 왔는데 털까지 다 뽑힐지경이네...그냥 레벨이 달라버리는데 경연은 무슨;;;
=
i dont get the part why this performance got 5th??? I mean seriously??????
=
Why do i feel like her voice suits on this song like she owns this song with a twist! 😍😍🥰🥰😲😲😲😲 #blackjacksforever #bomshells
=
BOM is love... the Queen
=
진짜 솔직히 개인적인 생각을 말하면
투애니원이 인기㉮ 적은 그룹도 아니고 대선배 한명을 두고 엄청겁나인𓅿𓂭개많지도 않는 ( 물론 인기는 많음 절대 까는거아님) 아이돌 그룹하고 붙는다는게 참 ...
=
와 편곡이ㄷㄷㄷ완전 자기색깔대로 다른노래를 만든듯
=
박봄이 여기 낄  짬이냐 더선배인데 ㅋ에휴 가슴아프다
=
파합이 이걸 제친다고? 노래 소화력부터 하늘과 땅차이다 정신좀 차려라 엠넷 좀 ;
=
여기도 노래 뺏었네...
=
진짜 드러그딜러 출신 가수. 미국식 힙합을 몸으로 배우심 ㅠㅠ
=
갠적으로 박봄이 댄스퍼포, 제스쳐부분을 신경쓰면 더 괜찮아지지않을까 싶음
너무 전체적으로 제스쳐가 엉성해서 노래를 끝내주게 잘하는데도 미묘하게 어색해보임..
댄서들이 힘내고 있지만 음.. 카메라는 박봄만 비추는데 계속 삐걱대서 집중이 안됨..
=
와 대박이다 소름돋았다 역시 박봄 노래잘부른다👍👍
=
지렸네 솔직히 컴백하고 나서 무대매너가 예전만 못하다는 느낌이었는데 이 무대에서는 투애니원 시절 카리스마가 어렴풋이 보인다 존나만족
=
Badass cheetah!!! ♥️♥️♥️
=
박봄님 목소리 좋긴 하지만 뭔가 신나는 느낌이 안들음 5위는 좀 오바긴 함
=
Love Park Bom 😍😍😍
=
0:15
=
I SERIOUSLY THINK THAT PARK BOM'S FINAL PERFORMANCE IN THIS SHOW WILL BE WITH HER 2NE1 CO-MEMBERS OR ONE/TWO OF THEM. I. CANNOT. WAIT. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE MNET.
=
The song that introduces many of us into queendom(sorry for mybad English )
=
YG 빌려간 2NE1 갚아
=
나는 저때 우기가 박봄 스타일로 바뀌어서 그래 라고 할 때 중국인일거라고 상상도 못했었는데
=
목소리 내취향..
=
The fact that this was the result of her reflections on why she got 5th on 1st round. Even claiming that the previous performance was a bit arrogant for just showing off vocals while the other teams aimed for a whole performance. Practiced like a trainee, and not being overly confident of her 10 year experience. I am proud of you Park Bom! I barely remembered Hann being G-iDLE's song (which by the way was a unique song that I couldnt imagine anyone who could give a cover that would do justice) while watching. 
Actually, you didn't do a cover. It was a revival. 
End point, I'm just so happy with her performance that I have to listen to this everyday. else my day wouldn't be complete 😄
=
박봄의 그 특유의 음색과 리듬 절대 아무도 못함 ㅠㅠ 막 약간 꺽이는 듯하면서 이색적인 이건 말로 설명 못함 하 와이지 미친놈들이 ㅠㅠ 보석을 즈그들 손으로 와장창 깨네
=
원곡들어보니 편곡을 아예 2ne1,블핑느낌나게 바꿔나서 훨좋고 박봄 보컬이랑 너무잘맞고 무대동선 안무 치타도입 전부 훌륭한데 이게 왓 더 5위임?
=
Legend
=
Love park bom but she’s lip singing
=
Her attitude/emotions in front of the camera is very 2ne1.. No matter what song she covers the "badass/girl crush aura of 2ne1" is naturally showing. That's one thing you cannot just learn overnight or be covered by fancy dress or backup dancers. 

She is now showing off, The legend is now representing her team very well, that's the 2ne1 stage presence.. 
Goodluck to other teams. She is now conquering the stage to tell everybody 2ne1 is no joke. 

we are all proud of you. 

💐💐💐 Park Bom 🌽🌽,
=
ㄱㅎㅎㅇㄹㅎㄹㄹㄹㄹㄱ
=
she's  beautiful like before
=
I keep forgetting Bom is not with YG anymore. Glad to see Queen Bom
=
치타 랩
2:16
=
다들 와~~!! 하는 반응이 아니라 충격에 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ벙찌고 본다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 여윽시 박봄
=
정말 오십번도 더 본다ᆢ
들을수록빠져들고ᆢ
박봄이란가수를
다시금 보고 생각케한다
항상좋은날만있길바란다
=
الملكه بارك بوم صوتها خيالي ومميز 👑💜
=
우선은. 목소리가 무댈 잡음 굿보이스..
=
Eu vivi para ver minha baby cantando essa música... MINHA DEUSA 😍
=
대선배인만큼 진짜 가장 프로답고 진짜 고퀄의 완성도인 커버 무대인데... 실력은 1순위인데...ㅠㅠ 왜 순위 이따구로 나오는지 진짜ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 내가 다 속상해ㅠㅠ
=
2:16
=
So goood👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
=
Make it 9 million, Blackjacks and Bomshells!!!
=
You marry, your singing carre is finished. I'm sorry. My security guards will shaparon you.
=
한 특색 개쎄서 걱정했는데 박봄 음색이 다 씹어 먹었고 아니.메이크업 왜이리 찰떡? 그동안 봐왔던 박봄중 제일 존예같음 ㄷㄷ 근데 의상이 좀 아쉬웠음 너무 팔락팔락 거려서인지 딱히 안무가 없어서 인지 뭔가 동작 하다만거 같고 옷에 가려져서 집중도 잘 안되고 의상이 조금 아쉬웠음 ㅜㅜ
=
박봄이라서 혼자 무대를 다 채울수 있는거였어..왠만한 솔로가수들도 물론 무대를 채울수 있긴 하지만,아이돌 그룹만큼 다 채우는 사람들은 드문데..
=
이미 도입부부터 박봄이 다 발랐고 치타 나올때 게임 끝났다 생각했는데 진짜 암넷 죽여버리고 싶다
=
where can i watch full episode?
=
퀸덤 마지막 때 투애니원 다 와서 엔딩하면 좋겠다...
=
Why (G)I-Dle choose Bom ? Simple because they know that bom will give Justice to their song.
=
언니 사랑해
=
다시봐도 역대급
=
ㄹㅇ 개인적으로 
1. 옴걸 
2. 박봄
34. 에오에,  맘무 
5. 아이들
6. 러블리즈

이건데 박봄 진짜 개잘했는데 5등 실화냐고
=
개멋있어......
=
Bommie we need this kind of comeback something dark and mysterious
=
이렇게 했는데 5위면 2NE1집합해야 할듯
빨리불러주세요 봄누님
=
치타도좋은데 씨엘이나 민지랑 보고싶다ㅜ
=
better than Idle's performance
=
팬덤으로도 박봄이 안 밀리는데 여긴 너무 애들 판이다..중 고딩들....
=
진짜 다른 것들도 다 들어봤는데 제일 원곡 생각 안나는게 이 무대인듯... 그냥 개인적인 생각으로 소화를 제일 잘 한 듯 싶다
=
봄언니한테 뭐라하는사람들 저기가서 시켜보거싶다;;ㅋ 재밌겠다
=
こんな難しい歌を1人で歌って踊れる彼女はやっぱり凄い❣️才能のある歌手がカムバしてくれて嬉しいな〜
=
Why soojin looks like she's possesed lol skkkkkkskkk cute💕😘
=
씨엘 어디갔냐
=
진짜 박봄 음색은 따라올 자가 없다. 피쳐링에 치타도 너무 좋지만, 나도 모르게 괜히 문이 열리기까지 씨엘을 속으로 외쳤다... 2NE1
=
치타 ㄷㄷ
=
IMCRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
=
니 노래 내 노래 시전
=
5th ? How the hell ?
=
박봄은 진짜 음색이 독특함
노래 들어보면  발음이 뭉개지는듯이 들리는데 
신기하게 가사가 잘 들림
=
She's so cool
=
Park Bom looks like one of those really expensive dalchi dolls you can get. (I call em dalchi dolls I don't know what their real names are but the channel I watch em on calls em dalchi.)
=
와 치타에 박봄인데 이게 5위????????역시 암넷 그냥 안보고 유투브로 찾아봐야겠네 보다가 암걸리겠네
=
The real QUEEN IS BACK
=
유튜브 영어댓글만 위로 올리는거 진짜 언제고치냐;;;
=
지민 치타나오는거 봤을 때
엄청 놀랐겠다 ㅋㅋ 
예전에 "엿 머겅~" 을 치타한테 날렸는뎅ㅋㅋ
=
2NE1 REUNION PLEASEEE😭😭😭😭
=
씨엘이 와줬다면 어땠었을까 그냥 실력으로도 원랜 1위인데 아주그냥 박봄 콘서트였을듯
=
Woww iloveyoubom hihi
=
진짜 관객투표만 하지말고 해외+국내 문자투표까지 해서 순위매기자 저 무대 하고 박봄 5위가 말이되냐;;
=
hwasa need work hard to beat this legend.. 1 person beat group.
=
사랑해 오니
=
가면 진짜 뒤질 것같다
=
La mejor sin duda alguna Park eres grandiosa te amooo
=
Win or lose, Bom proves that she is not just a queen but a Legend
=
엔딩때손모양2ne1시절손모양인거보고혼자울컥한1인.....
재결합기다릴께요존버는승리하니까요!!!!!
=
와 너무좋아
=
I need to keep coming here....been crying a lot before
=
첨엔 좀 실망이었는데 보면볼수록 좋음 ㅋㅋ 가끔 찾아봄 ㅋㅋ
=
솔직히 내생각으론 당연히 1등 할줄알았음 편곡 개잘했음 근데 요즘애들가수 아니니까 그래도 최소 3등은 할줄알았는데 5등이 뭐임
=
솔직히 모든 음악프로에서 제발 노래 끝나고
말 좀 지껄이면 좋겠어...집중이 다 끊겨...시끄럽고.
=
8,080,000M View!!!
Congratulations!!! Park Bom
=
노래방에서 2ne1노래 부르면 뮤비가 대부분 콘서트영상이라 멤버들 모두 미친듯이 즐겁게 노는걸 볼수있음 근데 이 무대에서 박봄이 그때처럼 즐거워 보여서 너무 좋았음
=
와 치타 개깐지난다..
=
저기서 치타가 박봄한텐 피쳐링 가수인데 aoa지민한테는 언프 때 경연 상대였었고 아이들소연한테는 프듀 때 선생님이고...ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 그나저나 봄 저 보컬 듣고 싶었다 진짜ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 2ne1못잃오ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
축하무대 : 박봄
=
Te amo, Bom
=
이거 20번은본거같은데 박봄님 목소리 1000년에 한번 나오면 다행일거같아요... 동시대여서 행복하네요
=
나 돈 안냈는데...
=
Her alone is VERY POWERFUL... But what if she invites all other 3 members of 2ne1. I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE, IT WOULD BE A TOTAL GRAND CONCERT.
=
Love my Bom
=
I wish she wore this clothing in finals.
=
최소 3등이라고 생각하는데..ㅠ
=
This performance was fire. She deserved to be placed at 4 at least
=
백댄서 진짜 잘뒀다 의상 노래 개사 진짜 모든게 완벽했음 박봄 ㄹㅇ 잘한다 중간에 백댄서들이 그렇게 화려하게 춤추는데도 박봄밖에 안보이더라 진짜 무대장악력 미친거같아
=
박봄 음색으로 커버했네요👍
=
Park Bom es sorprendente con esa voz inigualable que tiene
=
아니 박봄에 치타인데 이걸 파합♡ 이따구로부른애들한테 진다고?
=
와 박봄 오랜만에 보는데 인형같네... 인형... 어... 노래 잘 부르는 인형..
=
She's the oldest star in this show and girl showed them how a real show is done! Will always stan Park Bom and 2ne1
=
엄마사랑해요.♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
If 2ne1 performs the show will be over
=
근데 우기 저 머리 풀면 진쯔 두피 아프겠다 ..
=
Bom and AOA are the best of the this round
=
like i don't remember the original version anymore...
=
PARK BOM REALLY NAILED THIS PERFORMANCE AS OF THE SONG IS HER ❤❤❤ LOVE YOU PARK BOM  😻😻😻😻
=
ㅡ한ㅡ
아이들 : 독수리
박봄 : *불사조*
=
가글 띠용용 절뚝 고구마 창법
=
Just...Bom is a queen.
=
SHE HAS DIFFERENT VIBES OF HANN.  YOU NEVER FAILED TO AMAZED US PARK BOM. CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU NEXT WEEK HERE IN PHILIPPINES!
=
Park Bom - Miyeon
Park Bom - Minnie
Park Bom - Soojin
Park Bom, Cheetah - Soyeon
Park Bom - Yuqi
Park Bom - Shuhua
=
I think this was her best performance from the show. I only watch these clips so I thought she would make at least 3rd place but 5th is ridiculous. I wish she wasn't discouraged but I think she was bc she seemed to lose confidence in subsequent performances 😕 I hope people told her how good this was though, she made it her own song. And together with Cheetah, that was powerful. I felt like I was watching her in her 2ne1 days again, she's still got it.
=
이쀼잘어웅여
=
who's that girl at 2:30 who slammed the table???? SHE'S SO CUTE HAHAHAHHAHA
=
아니 도대체 무슨 논리로다가 순위를 매겼으면 잘한 애들이 전부 뒤로 밀리냐....커버곡을 이정도로 편곡하고  아무리 잘 부르면 뭐함...실력보다는 팬들 수로다가 이기는 거 같은데;;
=
실질적 상위권 박봄 2ㅡ3위 줘야 되는거 아니냐 1위는 AOA고 박봄 아이들 AOA 이 세팀은 지금도 꾸준히 찾아서 보고 있는 중이고
=
Linda e puro talento💙💙💙
=
i wanted so bad to see cl coming out of nowhere for the rap part
=
솔로다보니 호흡힘든게 들려요 근데 들리니까 라이브인거 티나서 대단하거같아요 you 이게 뭐라고 확땡기네요
=
원래 한이라는 노래 몰랐어서 나한테는 이게 원곡임ㅁㅊㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 박봄 음색이 독특해서 박봄 버젼을 먼저 들으면 다른 커버는 못 듣게 됨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 퀸덤 파이어 무대 볼때도 느꼈고...ㅇㅇ
=
2:17
=
봄언니 걍 오짐..
=
Queen Bom💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
=
Let us stream tomorrow for Park Bom's music!!!!!at 12pm. Stay tune
=
내가 박봄이었으면 출연 결정하기가 정말 힘들었을거같은데 그래도 이거보니까 역시 나오는게 옳은 결정이었던것같다
=
박봄 무대에 2NE1 멤버 나오면 나 진심 울거야
=
여기서 지민님이랑 치타님이랑 동갑임
=
요즘 아이돌들 다똑같이생기고 임팩드도없어서 뮤뱅안본지 오래임 
갑자기 아이돌들 열심히하는건알겟는데 
저렇게 좋아하는것도 가식으로보임
시 부레 그냥 투에니원 투피엠때가조앗서 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow the song sounds just like its hers!
=
I hope on the finals, she will bring Minzy, dara and CL. Jebal!!!
=
파합^^~♥♥♥♥이 이 이걸 이긴다구요???;;;;;;에바다
=
Why she mumbling like that lol
=
솔직히 러블리즙 보다 오디오훨씬꽉찼다
짬나바는 무시못하네 진짜 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
보미언니가짱이야
=
2ne1 main vocalist doing the B-E-S-T in her every queendom performance! 2ne1 vibe! Adding cheetah in the performance is like adding spice and spunk to the song! Super proud of bommie its like she owned the song..
=
3:11
???????????승희야???????????
=
내 맘속 1위♡
=
아니 퀸덤 다 좋은데 너무 팬덤빨이야 현장에 온 사람들이 어느 그룹 팬이냐는 거에 따라 너무 달라져 봄이 충분히 잘하고 상위권일만한데 현장 투표때문에 순위권 낮아서 좀 아쉽,,ㅠㅠ
=
I guess Dara suggest cheetah to perform with her because cL can perform with her because she still inside the dungeon of YG . Dara and cheetah are friends for a very long time . Dara and cheetah have been in the same variety show . Maybe Dara suggested cheetah since cL can’t perform with her .
=
0:14 i almost get heart attack when i saw yuqi . she looks like sandara
=
왜 봄이가 5등?? 
에휴. 암넷이 또 주작했겠지...
=
아니. 미쳤. 2:55 개미쳤네
=
박봄다리봐 씹젓가락 역시 봄
=
어휴..엠넷 내가 이럴줄 알았다..ㅋ...히트곡 경연때도 마이크 이상한거 주고..ㅋ...혹시 몰라 저 노래 박봄이 엠넷한테 하는 말일수도있어
=
No one is going to talk about Cheetah ? When she appeared I was so surprise and happy, she's so badass !
=
3:11
=
Park bom is the best 💞
=
Park bom is the best 💞
=
9M ! congratz PARK BOM :)
=
Queendom result is bull. Doesn't matter because she the queen.
=
언제나봐도 박봄은 쵝오네요~♡
=
1:48 who is she
=
치타개멋져..
=
これはなんの企画（番組）ですか？
=
그렇게 끼많던 2ne1 그냥 해체시키다니..저렇게 좋은 그룹 다시 나올 수 있을까? 2ne1 각자 소속사 계약 다 끝나면 다시 합쳤으면 좋겠다
=
이게 짬이다.....
=
ผอมลงแล้วนะแต่เสียงดีเหมือนเดิม
=
잠만 이거 치타가 한몫 했다...
=
아이들 팬이지만 박봄 대단하네연! 미모 , 실력 다 되버리는 ㅎㅎ 이번 퀸덤 조작이라는 게 여기서 드러나네연 ㅠ 박봄이 순위가...
=
무대장악력이  2ne1 그때 그대로.. 음색 가창력 진심 휘어잡는다.... 박봄 영향력이 이만큼입니다..
=
Beautiful girl
=
독보적이다 다른 세상 사람 같음
소연은 자기 곡인데 반응이 귀엽네
=
듣기도 전에 좋아요 믿듣이지!!!!👍
=
Bom would be good at singing joseon music
=
How is she losing weight so quickly! She looks sooooo good!
=
So Our Queen is backk!!
=
1:23
=
❤️❤️❤️💓💓💓💓
=
I like her make up 😍😍😍😍
=
Do you remember... you remember...remember 2NE1 ?💚







(Edit) Ty for like my comment
=
궁금한게 있는데 지금 국내 블랙잭 평균 나이가 어떻게 되요,,??저도 초딩때 투애니원 노랠 알고있긴했지만 지금 고1 되서야 늦게 블랙잭 됐는데 이게 어떻게 5위지 말도안돼..
=
that ending pose im- 

*cries in a corner*
=
💕💕
=
박봄은 저기있으면 반칙이지
씨엘까지있으면 두말할필요없지
=
박봄 솔로곡 발라드만 부르지말고 이런곡도 불렀으면 좋겠다 혼자서 완벽 소화하네
=
And suddenly I miss 2ne1
=
Park Bom's presentation is a big win for me.Bom's beauty is natural along with her voice and she dances simply and gracefully she deserves a higher rank in Queendom for that presentation
=
응~엠넷 다 주작이야~ 이제 엠넷에서 하는 투표란건 다 주작으로 본다 ~~~~
=
Kill them my Queen!!!
=
Who else thought Bom was going to bring one of her 2NE1 members?
=
저 무대가 5위였어요?? 말도안돼...
=
2:26 :))))))
=
치타도 잘했지만 CL나왔으면 뒤집어졌을거같다
=
I honestly can't get enough of this song. Bom's voice on 'new' material, delivered with the 2NE1 attitude I've missed so much. Yes.
=
Love hwasa's face is like - I am making a mental note of this performance
=
2NE1 Suprise Union plz🙏🏻
We have long wait 🖤
Plz let Blackjack happy🙏🏻😭
=
I like Bom's version a whole lot better
=
Go 15m perfomance fire (G)idle and 10m Park Bom , Blackland united
=
Cheetah wish it could be CL
Eunji wish it could be Minzy
=
That iconic Bom punch though, I remember I am the best....... 
Where's my Blackjack at?????
=
2:17
=
처음에 댄서들 롤린롤린 한당
=
경연곡이라서 다른 가수들은 다 퍼포먼스 무대 곡이라는 느낌이 들지만 이 노래만큼은 걍 새로운 앨범 그 자체였다.. 몰라.. 독보적이니까 순위에 신경쓰지마요 내가 퀸덤 음원중에 다운 받아서 듣는 유일한 노래입니다..
=
She and (G)idle no deserve this show, their another lv
=
The fact that this has 8 mil veiws just proves how iconic Park Bom is.
=
편곡 돋보이는거 외에도 치타가 뭐 어쩌겠다고 할때 표정 중독됨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
2:56 그저 웃음만 나온다 할 때 표정 진짜 황제폐하 진짜 ㅘ ㄴ너무 예쁘고 멋있고 멋있고 예쁘고 하 미쳐버려
=
QUEEN BOM
=
that 2ne1 sign in the end❤💪👑
=
존나 멋있어 진짜..음색 어디 안 가네 듣기 너무좋다
=
So I listened to the original (I love it btw!) and wow they really sound different! Bom really made this song hers.
=
봄봄😍💚
와아아아아아아
너무 좋아해~
=
Oh really? I just already know that this rank 5/6 . So disapointed ! Seem like PB make it be her own song !
=
1:19 thumbnail

Thank me later.
=
I know my idol 2ne1 proud of boom love you 2ne1 forever
=
Two queens on one stage
=
케이 pop 4등 봄언니 5등 이게ㅜ나라냐
=
솔직히 치타 랩 전소연보다 못함 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
결국 박봄 제외하고 솔로내서 음원1위 찍을 사람은 저기서 화사말고 없음
=
퀸덤 안 보지만 하루에 세번씩 챙겨보는거...
=
같은노랜데 완전 느낌다름
=
대표곡없는 피처링 전문랩퍼 등장
=
와 근데 전소연 조금 뭉클했겠다 연습생 때 멘토가 본인이 직접 제작한 노래 부르는게 ㅠ
=
무대 뭐 말할 것도 없고 이번 무대 미모 미쳤다
머리 색이 바뀐건가?? 화장법도 이게 훠러어얼씬 나은듯 ㅠㅠ  유앤아이때 이후로 예뻐보임 ㅠ
=
다른 그룹들은 다 든든한 멤버랑 같이 나가는데 혼자서 다 부르고 메꿔야 하는게 얼마나 부담스럽겠어요........그런데도 이렇게 멋진 무대만 보여주고 마지막에 투애니원 핸드포즈하는거 보니까 정말 눈물나네요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ투애니원이 지금까지도 앞으로도 최고일거에요
=
I'M REALLY GONNA SUE IF THIS SHOW ENDS WITHOUT A 2NE1 REUNION PERFORMANCE
=
미쳤나봐 음색 하나로 곡이 아예 그냥 박봄 노래네 진짜 차원이 다르다 진짜 와 댓글 안다는데 놀라서 진짜 와 우와....
=
almost 10M guys!!! =)
=
There is only 0.0000001% Dnation could read this, but please make Bom comeback with this kind of vibe and song!
=
당연히 상위권일 줄 알았는데 .. 5등이라고 ? .... 할말이 없네
=
그냥 짬이 아니라고!!!멋있다!!!!
=
Kesp treaming
=
I got goosebumps
=
하...  박봄이 잘해줘서 너무 마음이 놓임...  다른그룹조 너무 좋은데 박봄은 제발 잘했으면 하고 조마조마 했음.
=
개좋음
=
퀸덤을 못 봣는데 5위라구요???? 왜 아 아이돌 팬덤 투표는 솔직히 좀 아니지..ㅠㅠㅠ 걍 진짜 부족함 없는 무대같은데 넘 안타깝다 ㅁㅇ루ㅜㅠ.ㅠ.ㅜㅜ제 맘의 1위..
=
<3
=
이거 립싱큰가요 라이븐가요..
=
This is such a big deal to GIDLE,  a monster legend (Park Bom) covering their song plus Cheetah which was Soyeon’s trainor in P101. Wow, so proud 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
=
Park Bom to taka Maryla Rodowicz Korei <3
=
나도 이해안가는 순위라고 생각하지만 팬덤석은 공평하게 같은수로 신청받았음. 팬덤이랑 노상관임
=
Dance more my park boom
=
저리 오지마 돌아보지마 -전남친-
=
역시 내공깊은 짬에서 나오는 바이브... 크 오진다 그냥 무대를 통째로 다 씹어버리셨네
=
치타랩 개오진다
=
❤️💔
=
Agree this if the song very fit into Park Bom 😅👍
=
Only a member of 2NE1 can make other group's song their own. The arrangements is like 2NE1 style ❤
=
처음엔 되게 원곡에 익숙해서 이질감들어서 보다가 껐는데 갑자기 다시 생각나서 들어오니까 존나 좋네 진짜 봄이 왔다 최고다
=
I wish they had a ComeBack for Real please please..
=
Park Bom 👑
=
Queen!!!
=
허........  wow
=
Aoa랑 박봄이 거의 1등인거같은데..
=
Whos name this girl???
=
Parkbomb 2ne1 = Rose' blackpink
Rose' blackpink = Parkbomb 2ne1
The best twin
=
🙌✨
=
Uploaded 5 hrs ago and it already have 535K views . Legendary Queen indeed . Well I'm surprised but not quiet cause when I first saw G-IDLE I already felt the 2NE1 vibe In them that's why I know Park Bom Queen can slay this . Only a cover song buy felt like her own song . Please vote for her she deserves to be on top well actually she's already topping on real time melon charts
=
Park bom?
=
와  박봄  짱이다
=
치타 브아걸인줄 알았음
=
2ne1스러워졌어
=
The studio version of bom's cover of hann will be released tom Sept 13 at 12NN!
=
마마무에 누가 없눈뎅?
=
3:08 was she singing here ? I'm confused
=
2:16
=
How can I vote? Hahahaha
=
이제야 투애니원 박봄같음 소속사 바뀌고 소속사에서 청순쪽만 밀어붙이니까 박봄 원래 스타일을 못봐서 아쉬웠었는데 여기나와서 이런거 해주니까 너무 좋다
=
she nailed it just by herself
=
I forgot original version
=
I can not remember ten thousand years ago like it was yesterday. Is like ten days ago and my short term memory is bad.
=
ㄹㅇ 무대를 장난감처럼 갖고 노는 클라스...
=
When she did that 2NE1's hand sign at the end...... TT
=
솔직히 퀸덤에서 실력으로 박봄보다 위는 없다고 생각함 하지만 박봄혼자만으로 다른 그룹보다 창의적인 생각이 나오기 힘들고 박봄에 대한 기대치가 너무 높아서 그동안 계속 퀸덤에서 하위권인거 같음 ㅜㅜ
박봄도 다른 투에니원 멤버랑 같이하면서 더 새롭고 그리웠던 무대 보고싶다ㅜㅜ
=
너무멋지네  홀로서기힘네요.
=
박춘아  치타   맛잇는거사줘
=
💓
=
완벽한 편곡 + 박봄 음색 + 치타  그냥 너무 사기....
=
Ajajajajjaajjajajaja 2:29 the best part
=
만렙보스 같은 포스네 박봄은
개멋있다!!!! 무대 퀄 자체가 틀리구먼
투애니원!!!! 박봄!!!!!!
=
난 아이들이랑 박봄께 좋더라..색다른 컨셉이여서..아이들 영원하자!!
=
박봄 한명이서 저 큰 무대를 꽉 채운다ㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜ존재감 미쳤고 편곡도 너무 자기랑 잘어울리게 바꾸어 놓으신 박봄님..ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 그냥 한마디로 하면 무대를 다스리는거 같음..와
=
이쁘네
화장 이렇게만 하면 딱 이쁘고 전혀 이상하지 않아요
=
I didnt expect that cheetah will be her special guest-
=
전설
=
미쳤다
=
It sounds like it's her own song.
=
Wow.!! 😊😊
=
Queen Rapper CL is a little bit late here. It must have been her but her YG contract expires after Queendom T^T
=
QUEEN BOM
=
목소리..독보적이네
=
*this is currently viral in Korea. HER POWER*
=
Love you a lot Park Bom unnie 💟😘 #2ne1
=
SLAY QUEEN BOM SLAY!!😍❤👑
=
We can’t be more proud of you 👑 a living legend
=
ประสบการณ์ล้วนๆเลย เล่นกล้องเก่งจริงๆ ขยับตัวนิดเดียวแต่ดูยิ่งใหญ่ ชอบตอนเล่นกับกล้องมาก เสียดายแต่หน้าเนี่ยแหละ ทำซะหน้ายับเยินไปหมดทั้งหน้าเลย เห้อออ
=
Every time she does the 2NE1 hand signal I feel like it’s a sign to keep believing 😭like they’ll be back
=
เพลงอะไรอะ what your music
=
나는 랩을 정말 좋아한다
=
หน้านางเริ่มมีอายุเเต่นางทำเต็มที่👑👑👑👑"
=
여자아이들이 원곡이라는거 댓글보고 알게됨......
=
MNET love 2NE1 but Hate YG. 

Until now 2ne1 still holds the most win in MAMA by a FEMALE GROUP with 4 awards including 2 MAJOR awards (Best Female, Best Music Video, Album of the yr, Artist of the yr) plus Park bom 1(Best Digital Single)

A total of 5 awards all in One Night! True Queens!
=
러블리즈는 5명인가 6명인가서 무대 하는데도 무대가 허전함 근데 박봄은 혼자 하는데도 무대장악력 오진다
역시 봄언니,,
=
Park Bom alone can outshine the others in group. She’s just wayyyyyyyyy tooo hot omgggg
=
음역대, 성량은 다른 팀 다 갖다붙여도 박살낼 무대인데 순위는 다른가보네;; 이게 2ne1 리즈시절 때 했으면 그냥 1등인데
=
she made this song her own... just as the queen she is.
=
솔까 박봄이랑 아이들이랑은 상위권에 들어가는게 당연한거 아님? 개잘했는데 이해가 안가네?
=
혼자서 걸그룹 분량 다 채우면서 하는거 대단하다.. 엄청 힘들텐데.
=
She is so underrated in this show. The Legend deserves more 🙌👸
=
여왕님이시당 다비켜라 이거네 봄최고
=
나 진짜 순위 발표 할 때 눈물 날 뻔 했어... 봄 언니 속상한거 보니까 억장 와르르 파압이 4위인데... 상처 받지 마 언니 ㅠㅠ
=
2NE1 때 나왔어봐라 압살이다 진짜 공백기 때문에 5위한거다 
무대만 보면 박봄 압살이다. -한 무무의 말
=
이 영상을 보면서 처음으로 원곡이 생각이 안 났다..검색까지 했음;;
=
제발 특별무대로 퉤니원 완전체로 crush 무대 해줬으면 그러면 ㄹㅇ 아무도 못 깝칠듯
=
이게 순위 낮은게 이해가 안간다 진짜 ㅋㅋ
=
Queen. She deserves all the Glory♥️🍃
=
I don't care about the result !! 
I care about one of my idol im 2ne1 she really proved that she is a queen . . .  look and listen to her style . .   love you boom.. #2ne1
=
I cant wait to see 2NE1 perform in Queendom 😭
=
Park BOM 🙌🙌  once a queen will always be a queen 🔥🔥
=
진짜 거대하고 위대한 여왕님의 앞에 앉아있는 기분이 든다....대박이야..난 이게 러블리즈보다 아래라는게 빡쳐서 죽을것같음
=
I mean, Bom doesnt need to work hard just to make this performance slay. Her voice itself, is SLAY
=
2:55 부터 살짝 웃을때 넘이쁘다 진심..... 아가같아ㅠㅠㅠ예뻐ㅠㅠㅠ
=
like how could this be at top 5?!?
=
As usual, when 2NE1 (or any one of them) performs, it will become a concert 💚
=
I LOVE YOU BOM!!!
=
Im only watching Bom❤❤❤
=
진짜 무대장악력 오지네... 사랑해...
=
편곡이란 이런것다! 라고 가르쳐주는것 같다♥ 후배들이 감동먹은 표정이 연실이 들어나는 듯 박봄 흥하쟈~
=
역시 짬에서 나오는 바이브가 있군
선곡도 잘하고 편곡도 진짜 잘했다
=
근데 진짜 박봄 혼자서도 이정돈데 투애니원 다 데려오면 진짜 어떻게 되는 거지... 씨엘 한 명만 데려와도 난리날텐데
=
I think she was lipsyncing? Anyways, wonderful performance my girl
=
누군지 몰라도 돌아가면 목숨보장 못할것같아요ㅋㅋㅋ
봄이 언니 쨩(ㅜㅁㅜ)/♡
=
Back here again. She is really owning this song everyday, every play! 🙌💚🙌💚🙌
=
박봄 화이팅 ㅠㅠ!!
=
그래도 박봄은 이길 생각보다도 즐기고 여태 쌓인 파워 다 보여주고 싶은 기분 일듯 ㅠㅠ5위였어도 엄청 후련했을듯
=
뽀쨕뽀쨕 춤추는거 왜 이렇게 귀여워ㅠㅠ
=
목소리중독성대박 ㅠㅠ
=
Lmao I thought it was her song 😅
=
박봄 무대보는데 아이돌들 다 동경의 눈으로 봐.... 엉엉
=
Gidle and Bom's performances ARE SO LIT NOT GONNA LIE their covers of Fire and Hann gave me goosebumps come on guys for the neverlands and blackjacks 😍💕
=
어찌됐든 박봄 언니가 최고임 ❤👍 언니가 넘사벽이라      순위상관없어요 어차피 실력아니까요 ㅋㅋ 원래 잘난사람들은 조용한법 사랑해 온니 ❤🤟
=
솔까 이게 러블리즈를 못이기냐 ㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎ 웃긴다 ㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋ
=
널 지우리라 후반부에 이거 개쩌는듯 ㄷㄱ
=
다들 무대 보다가 얼어서 투표 못한 걸 수도 있음 5위가 말이냐 절대 아니지•••
=
Bom doesn't need to prove herself no more by just watching this performance brings back the nostalgic old era of kpop Legends  ❤️
=
She kills it 👀
=
박봄 목소리가 너무 매력적이다 뭘 불러도 박봄 노래가 되는듯
=
최고중에 최고다
=
Wow i can't help watching again and again
=
박봄는 너무 예뻐요!
=
I love Park bom ❤️
=
5등이래... 사심투표 더럽다
=
슈화가 너무 잘어울려효 하는거 개귀엽다
=
2NE1보고 싶다..... 노래 다 중독성있고 질리지도 않고 좋았는데... 목소리 진짜 늪지대같다...  빠지면 나올수가 없음...계속 빨려들어가...  진심 매력엄청나.....


4시44분도 엄청 잘듣고 있는데....노래 많이 불러주세연 ..
=
개 쌉오바잖아ㅋㅋ 난 박봄이 최소 3위는 할 거라고 생각했어ㅋㅋ 완전 자기노래잖아 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
2NE1 LEGENDARY♥️
=
이게 왜5위야 진짜 어이없네 무슨기준으로 순위매기는거임?
=
2:28 와 이사람도 아이돌임? 미쳐돌아가는구나...
=
아빠한테 동영상 안 보여주고 노래만 들려줬더니 2ne1 노래 아니냐고 함...
=
마마무랑 AOA무대 먼저 봐서 그럴수도 있어요 처음 무대가 너무 강렬해서 ㅎㅎㅎ 저도 본방 때는 부족하다 라고 느꼈는데  다시 보니  역시 대선배는 뭔가 다른 아우라가 느껴지네요 멋진 무대에요
=
Omg Park Bom just did the 2NE1 sign
=
난 봄이 음색 넘 좋아해서 노래 부르는거 그냥 원없이 들을란다 봄아 니가 최고야! 내 마음속의 1등이었어
=
BRUH IM TREMBLING FROM ALL THE ENERGY
=
5위라고 개애반데 박봄 보컬 못따라함
=
조회수만 봐도 전혀 5등감은 아닌데.. 물론 다른 팀들도 잘했지만 진짜 러블리즈보다 낮은 등수의 무대는 아니였다
=
1:48 ... 식스센스......너 였구나
=
ยิ่งดูยิ่งคิดถึง2ne1 เชียร์แม่นะสู้ๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆ😘😘😘😘
=
엠넷아 뉴스떴다 퀸덤도 재수사가 필요해!
=
still a queen
=
레전드 2:15
=
8 million :) bom fightinggg
=
박봄이랑 너무 잘 어울리고 노래도 잘했는데... 너무 불리해서 아쉬움.. 치타 랩부분 빼고는 혼자서 6인 분량을 채운건데도 무대가 비어보이지 않는다.. 안무야 오랫동안 춤을 안춰왔고, 2NE1 때도 특유의 음색으로 곡에 무개감을 주는 메인보컬이었지, 춤으로 내세우는 가수는 아니었음. 치타도 잘했지만, 2NE1 멤버들 모두는 아니더라도 그 중에 한 명 데리고 왔으면 1등했을 듯
=
씨엘 어디서 뭐하노!! 많이 바쁘나!! 와서 박봄이랑 무대 같이 해주라!! 그러면 눈물 개짤듯ㅠ
=
박봄의 흘려버리는 듯한... 노래 스타일 멋지네. 그러니 얼굴에는 그만,,, 왕성한 활동부탁함. 그리고 you and i 인가.. 그런 스타일 음악하면 좋겠다.
=
park bom just turned this into a whole new song omg
=
역시 박봄음색 넘특이하고개성강해서 무슨노래를 부르든 다 자기노래로 만드는듯 곡소화력 쩔어
=
아이들 희생양됐다 치고 이게 5위고 러블리즈가 4위...ㅎ
=
Somehow, I find this "competition" unfair. Bom is a solo singer now. You want her to sing against groups of many girls. That just doesn't make sense. I don't get that.
=
어휴..팬덤싸움이네
=
I just dont get it when people expect her to show more? What else to show? She showed everything. She's a SOLO. You expect colors and harmonization? 

She's doing it alone, and im proud.
=
Let's not forget shes 35 and killing it!!! Kill it for us experiences girls!!
=
So far with DNation, Bom nvr had bad outfits or other things. they really took care of her. 👍👍
=
Oh my God,  my girl is dancing on stage, and her vocal tone, this song is trending no.1 now together with bom on melon
=
다른무대보고 이거보니까 박봄이 잘하긴하는구나싶음 무대장악력ㄷㄷ aoa랑 박봄 무대밖에 기억안남
=
Who comes here again think that Bom won? 
She really made the song into hers. Like she owns the song while Gidle was great but the fire is still best on its original
=
이번주내내 이거 하루에 10번넘게 반복재생중;;;;후 취저;;;;;투애니원향수 제대로불러오네;;;;;
=
이게 왜 5위냐면 팬층때문이 아닐까 싶네
투애니원 해체 되고 팬층 옅어 졌다 해야하나 
그리고 투애니원때 부터 팬이었던 사람들은 지금쯤 30대쯤 될려나 그래서 라이브 못오고 현장 투표? 이런것도 밀려서 5위 아닐까
솔직히 내가 생각하는 순위는
오마이걸 - 에오에 - 박봄 - 마마무 - 아이들 - 러블리즈
인거 같은데 솔직히 옴걸 , 에오에 정말 잘했고
마마무는 그 솔라 였나 그분이 살짝 삐끗해서 점수 깎아졌다 라고 볼수있는데 러블리즈가 4위인건 진짜 말도 안된다.. 파아합~ 파아합~ 이런식으로 부르는데 4위라고? 컨셉에 진짜 안맞음 아이들은 분위기가 비슷해서? 그렇다 쳐도...

요약해서 박봄님이 왜 왜 왜 왜 5위냐고
=
킬링파트 49초
립싱크같냐
=
It makes no sense to me why anyone would rank her below top 3 let alone top 2... it’s crazy to me that they chose such a biased audience, boms stage easily topped her 2nd and 1st tbh and yet they played her again and placed her 4th (or 3rd whoever said it) which makes absolutely no sense, I’m honestly just watching for her and that’s really it because clearly this show isn’t voting on who ACTUALLY DESERVES IT, they’re just voting for who they simply like or whoever they personally have a bias towards.
=
I'm still here after thousands replaysssss 😍😍😍😍😍
=
When she pronounced "Boo boo boo lonely life" correctly I was so satisfied 😂😂😂 that part was amazing and even G(Idle) was shook
=
Well, that's our queen Park Bom..  No matter how many time you criticize her for her new appearance.. but her voice still remains the same..strong,  powerful with her own uniqueness.. I'm saying this because I want you guys to appreciate her talents without being judgemental.. whatever she did was her own decision.. and we are not in the place to judge her decision.. coz we're not perfect too..
=
3:26 oMG, THIS GIRL IN THE PUBLIC LOOKS JUST LIKE WEKI MEKI'S RINA
=
다른무대보다 확실히 자기스타일로 바꾼게 차이가 확 나는것같음.... 스타일이 확실하게 확 변함.... 걍 박봄노래 그 자체인데?
=
다들 봄 실력알아주는 것 같아서 괜히 뿌듯하고 뭉클하네 이제 투애니원 꽃길만 걸어라ㅜㅜ
=
박봄 혼자 나와서 하는거 보니까 2ne1 완전체면 다 끝장 날듯
=
아 진짜 박봄 미쳤다 그 투애니원만의 무대 장악력은 아무도 못 따라오는듯ㅠㅠ 전 무대보다 살도 더 빠진 것 같구.. 진짜 이갈고 햇구나 느낌 메컵 의상도 너무 찰떡이고 눈 밑에 붙인 스톤 진짜예쁘닺ㄴ짜ㅜㅜㅠㅠ
=
이거 어떤 외국인분이 가사가 yg한테 하는 얘기 같다고 하셨는데 진짜 가사 보니까 딱 맞아떨어져서 조금 소름 돋았음;;;
=
Well.... When I first time listen to this song, I thought that original is better than this one, but now... 

I love this one!!
=
근데 박봄이 무대위에서 제스쳐나 춤 추는거 어색한건 사실임
=
기존 안무 없애고 박봄식으로 퍼포먼스 새로 만든거 너무 잘한 것 같음 진짜 박봄노래 같았다 특히 3분쯤 나오는 You! 너무 멋있음 짬밥이 보인다
=
Who can agree lion fits her if she sings that song
=
If she wins or loses, she shows that she can be not only a queen or a legend, but a goddess.
=
She can fill the stage only with her voice. I guess that she can do that even without a mic at ordinary-sized music halls as classical vocals do. 
High talent and a true artist that we can hardly ever see in the field of pop music.
=
Owning someone else's song is queen
=
I remembered Unpretty Rapstar when Cheetah came in because of Jimin 😂
=
Im back here because WTF??! SHE AT THE BOTTOM 2 WITH GIDLE??
lmao
=
2ne1's Park Bom 💕
=
솔직히 오마이걸-박봄-aoa-마마무-아이들-러블리즈여야 맞는 순위 아닌가........
=
👏👏👏😭😭 park bom ft CL😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 ,, 👏👏
=
박봄 너무 잘해ㅠㅠ
=
진짜 내가 본 퀸덤중 젤 레전드 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Love her ❤❤❤
=
3:09 승희 리액션ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Hope the rapper was CL! 😩😭
=
처음에 이 영상봤을때는 원곡모르고봐서 임팩트약하다 생각했는데 원곡 듣고 이게 더 듣고싶어서 계속 보게 되네
=
3:40
이거 보려고 계속 들어온다
=
I literally got goosebumps within the first 5 seconds. That shows the power she holds.
=
그러고보니 치타는 소연의 쌤이기도 하지만 지민ㅇ랑은 경쟁자였넹
=
The remix suits her well ..nice one park boom !
=
저거 방청객들 나이 진짜 어린가보다...박봄 인지도가 낮은건가
=
PARK BOM IS BACK EVERYONE
=
Bomie you nailed it. You look so gorgeous with your outfit. Beautiful Bom!!!
=
이게 어떻게 5위지 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 매번 들어도 대단하다 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Jimin screaming when Cheetah came 💕💕
=
박봄 ㄹㅇ 보물이다 ㅠㅠ❤❤
=
이게 5등한 무대로는 너무 아까운데 다른 그룹은 팬빨인가...
=
your unique, continuous special voice!!!!👍
=
언니 진짜 개잘함 사랑해
=
wow, bom  IS SO GOOD IN THIS SONG
=
개인적으로 개 취저 박봄 레전드ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 이 모습 오랜만이라 짠하당 ㅠㅠ 2ne1포즈두..
=
박봄이 한 부를때 마녀가 주술부리는 줄 알았어...
=
2:56  그저 웃음만 나온다
=
울음 먹은 목소리가 너모 이뿌다 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park bom misses her members sameeeeee huhuhuhu i would really like to watch you again with youre members
=
The 2ne1 sign she threw at the end 😢
=
I love her voice ♥️. This song really suits her.
=
무슨 김연아 소트니코바한테 진 느낌 똑같이 돌려받음.. 5위 너무 심한거아니냐고 진짜 누구보다 퀸이라는 이름에 걸맞는데..ㅠㅠㅠ
=
every time I see this video ... I feel like crying ... miss 2ne1 ... please join them again on one stage ...😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
그냥 완전 박봄노래되버림ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 포스봐! 멋있어요
=
럽리보다 낮은 이유가 그래서 뭐라구요..?
=
Padahal d sini bom membawakan lagunya beda bgt, dan  bahkan lebih bagus  dr pd penyanyi aslinya . Kok ka dpt peringkat pertama 😕
=
개잘햇는데 댓글보니까 이게 왜 5위라는거임??
=
마지막 손모양 투애니원 표시 아닌가...
=
3:41학
=
왜 5등이지.....
=
박봄 마지막에 투애니원 손 제스쳐 나만 울컥하냐...
=
박봄은 이미지 제대로네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Best Vocal Ever - Park Bom!!
=
다가가면 죽을것같애 ..
=
와...역시 박봄이다 라는말밖에 안나옴
근데 엠넷은 왜 립싱크인거 처럼 해가지고ㅡㅡ
라이브무대 보고싶은데ㅠㅠ
=
조작투표인가? 박봄이 5위라니
=
I hope she brings 2NE1 for next stage 🙏🏼
=
언니 목소리 너무 좋아 채고
가끔 주변 친구들이 박봄 목소리 흔들리고 불안정해서 별로다는 말들으면 가서 목상태가 안 좋고 몸이 아파서 그렇다고 말은 해주고싶은데 참아 못 하고 조용히 지켜보는..ㅠㅠ
그래도 난 지금도 듣기 좋은걸
=
파아하아압 파아하아압 (찡긋)
=
개 잘한다 그러는데 그저그런디 난
=
she’s queen😩❤️❤️
=
원곡 보고 왔는데 컨셉도 그렇고 이게 훨 좋넹
=
순위는 유튜브 조회수와 영상 좋아요 수가 정하는거지
=
순위 이상해...;;
=
난 박봄이 ... 러블읍읍 보다 낮다는게 이해가안가 ㅂㄷㅂㄷㅂㄷ!!
=
인기투표 식빵 ..실력을 안보네
=
Miyeon and Bom voice sound alike...
=
왜 1위가 아닐까? 분위기가 압도적인뎁
=
진짜 너무예쁘고 너무잘한다,,,,이걸 혼자서 저렇게 소화를 한다니 진짜 말도안돼
=
박봄 존나 예쁘네
=
문득 든 생각인데 화사랑 치타 콜라보무대 하면 박살날듯
=
2:15
=
She should have a comeback like this. It suits her actually.
=
아니 이게 왜 5위야..
=
This is the real BoM... finally the queen is back.. she is good at ballad.. but darkness mysteriously red queen is so her
=
박봄 목소리 불호라고 생각했는데 딱히 별다른 퍼포 없이 노래로 집중시키는 거 보면 잘하기는 한다... 새삼
=
워 자기노래를 만들어버렸네. 여러명이서 부르는거 혼자다하고. 치타랩도 너무 좋았음. 무대좋았다
=
아직도 박봄 마약하지 않았냐고 여기 글 올리시는 분들이 있어 그냥 지나칠 수가 없네요. 너무나도 슬프고 마음 아픈 얘기라 꺼내기도 싫지만요. 박봄이 데뷔 전부터 미국에서 ADD치료 목적으로 처방 받아 복용한 약인 에더럴에 포함된 네 종류의 암페타민들은 환각/쾌락효과가 나타나지 않도록 치료 목적으로 만들어진 성분입니다. 마약이 아닙니다. 그런 목적으로 복용하는 약이 아니예요.  암페타민에 종류가 다양한데 전문지식이 없는 일반인들은 주로 환각/쾌락 목적으로 복용하게 되는 메스암페타민과 암페타민을 동일시하는 경향이 있습니다. 에더럴엔 메스암페타민 등 쾌락/환각작용이 강한 암페타민은 포함되어 있지 않습니다. 엄연히 미FDA 허가를 받은 치료제입니다. 박봄이 받은 진단명은 ADD이기 때문에 마약을 처방받아 복용할 이유가 전혀 없고, 멀쩡한 사람에게 마약을 처방해 주는 정신나간 의사도 없습니다. 다만, 향정신효과, 각성효과가 있어 중독/의존의 위험이 있기 때문에 우리나라에서 임의로 '마약류'로 분류해 '마약류 관리법'에 의해 규제하고 있습니다. '마약류'와 '마약'은 엄연히 다른 개념입니다. '마약류'로 분류해 놓았다고 해서 마약 아닌 성분이나 약이 마약이 되는게 아닙니다. 2010년 세관신고 없이 국내배송하다 통관에서 이슈가 된 것이고 당시 에더럴의 향정신등급에 따른 조사에서 약물검사에서 음성 나오고 과다 복용 없이 처방전대로 복용한 것으로 밝혀져 치료목적이 자명해 유예가 되었죠. 즉, 검찰로부터 "법에 저촉되는 부분이 없음"판정을 받습니다. 이후 병원을 국내 병원으로 옮기고 치료약도 국내 유통약으로 변경을 하게 되죠. 그런데, 이걸 갑자기 4년 후 2014년 이 분야에 전문적인 지식이 전혀 없는 언론 (이 찌라시의 시작은 세계일보인 걸로 알고 있습니다) 에서 뜬금없이 터트리면서 의/법학적 과학적 검증을 거치지 않은채 엉터리 보도 ("박봄이 복용했고 세관신고 없이 국내배송하다 적발된 에더럴은 치료목적이었다고는 해도 엄연한 마약인데 마약반입 사건이 어떻게 입건유예가 될 수 있나! 이건 검찰에서 YG봐주기 수사를 한거다"라고) 하며 마약복용, 가족마약단, 마약밀반입, YG봐주기 수사로 마녀사냥한게 '박봄 마약 스캔들' 이예요. 도대체 누가 왜 이런 터무니 없고 어이 없는 대규모 언론/여론선동으로 당시 최고의 탑스타를 묻어 버리고 최고의 레전드 그룹 2NE1 을 해체시켜버렸는지에 대해서도 말이 많은데 그런 것들 역시 박봄 스캔들과 마찬가지로 찌라시일 뿐이니까요. 여기엔 팩트만 쓰겠습니다. 참고로 ADD와 ADHD를 혼동하시는 분들이 계신데 ADD는 ADHD와 달리 공격성, 폭력성, 충동성 등과 무관합니다. 박봄을 쭈욱 보아오면 완전 순둥이죠. 마음도 얼마나 여린지 눈물이 넘흐 많어 ㅠ.ㅠ 이런 사람을 온 세상 사람들이 노려보며 욕하고 돌을 던졌습니다. 그 떄 받았을 마음의 상처와 트라우마. 세상과 사람들에 대한 무서움과 두려움이 얼마나 컸을지 상상이 안됩니다. 개인이 감당할 수 있는 수준의 것이 아니예요. 그런데도 불구하고 "난 노래하는게 너무 좋고 노래를 부르며 사랑받고 싶다" 고 다시 나와주었죠. 

(추가) 아래 댓글을 읽다보니 많은 분들이 혼동하시는 부분이 있어 추가로 기술합니다. 미국에서 마약 아닌게 한국에선 마약이 되고, 한국에서 마약이 아닌게 유럽에선 마약이 되는 일은 이 세상 의/법학에 없습니다. 마약은 정확한 학계의 정의와 기준에 의해 정해지는 것입니다. 에더럴이나 에더럴에 포함되어 있는 네 종류의 암페타민들 (Amphetamine aspartate monohydrate,  amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, dextroamphetamine sulfate)은 마약이 아닙니다. '마약류 관리법'의 규제를 받는다고 해서 마약 아닌 약이 대한민국에서는 마약으로 인정 되는게 아닙니다.  박봄이 2010년 통관이슈당시 시행받은 약물검사에서 음성으로 나온 것이 이를 말해 줍니다. 에더럴이 우리나라에서는 마약이라면 당시 검사에서 마약양성이 나왔겠죠. 아래 어떤 분은 코데인 섞인 감기약과 에더럴을 비유하며 말씀하셨는데 코데인은 엄연한 마약입니다. 에더럴에 포함된 암페타민들과는 다른 차원입니다. 이해하기 쉽도록 예를 들어 말씀드리겠습니다. "나이퀼 (NyQuil)"이라는 약은 미국에서 처방 없이 구입 가능할 정도로 흔한 감기약입니다 (인터넷 쇼핑으로도 구입가능할 정도입니다). 하지만, 나이퀼내부에 포함되어 있는 덱스트로메트로판(dextromethorphan)이라는 성분의 향정신효과때문에 중독/의존의 위험이 있어 우리나라에서는 '마약류 관리법'에 의해 규제하고 있습니다. 미국에선 흔하지만 국내에서는 규제를 받는 에더럴과 같은 맥락입니다. 그렇다고 나이퀼이라는약이 대한민국에서는 마약이 되거나 마약으로 인정되는게 아닙니다. 외국에서 나이퀼을 구해 국내 배송해도 미리 세관에 신고를 하지 않았다면 에더럴과 마찬가지로 통관에서 걸리게 되어있습니다. 그렇다고 그 사람이 마약복용 혹은 마약밀반입이라는 오명을 뒤집어 쓰지는 않습니다. 하지만, 언론에서 마약복용/마약밀반입이라고, 각종 그럴듯한 가짜 근거들을 짜맞추어 교묘하게 편향보도한다면 나이퀼이나 덱스트로메트로판이라는 약이 낯설고 전문적인 지식이 없는 일반인 입장에서는 언론에 노출되는 정보만을 믿고 움직이게 되는 것입니다. 2014년 당시 스캔들이 그런 식으로 자극적으로 부풀려져 진행이 되었고, 여론의 엄청난 관심을 받으며 진행된 스캔들과 달리, 그러한 보도들이 잘못된 근거들로부터 조작되고 도출된 오보였다는 것이 밝혀지는 과정은 여론의 관심 밖에서 조용히 진행되었기 때문에 여전히 많은 분들이 진실에 대해 모르고 계신 상황이예요. 실제, '마약류 관리법'에 대해 알지 못하는 일반인이 외국에서 구한 규제약을 국내반입하다 통관에서 걸리는 일이 드물지 않다고 합니다. 그럴 수 밖에 없는 것이 '마약류 관리법' 에는 '마약'이외에도 200개 가까이 되는 향정신성분이 포함되어 있는데 이러한 정보는 일반인들이 접근하기 어렵고 접근한다는게 상식적이지도 않고 접근한다 해도 이해하기 어렵기 때문입니다. 통관에서 이러한 이슈가 발생하면 각 약제마다 정해져 있는 향정신등급에 따라 절차를 밟게 되고, 조사 결과 법에 저촉되는 부분 즉, '치료 목적 이외의 복용'이 확인되면 비로소 죄가 인정되어 처벌을 받게 됩니다. 박봄은 2010년 통관이슈당시 절차대로 조사를 받았고 약물검사에서 음성이 나왔으며 과다복용 없이 처방전대로 복용한 것이 밝혀졌기 때문에 비난을 받을 이유가 없습니다. 오히려 지난 무려 5년 동안 세상에 나오지 못하고 묻혀지내며 박봄이 받은 피해와 상처를 생각하면 그녀를 지켜주지 못했고 비겁하게 무지한 폭력적 다수의 편에 서서 너무도 손쉽게 연약하기 그지 없는 한 사람을 향해 무차별 폭격한 우리 모두가 잘못을 인정하고 뉘위쳐야합니다. 그것이야 말로 중대한 무지의 죄입니다. 그녀를 이전보다도 더 신경써주고 아껴주고 따뜻한 마음으로 보살펴, 빠른 시일 안에 예전처럼 즐겁게 노래에만 전념할 수 있도록 도와주는게 도리이고 용서 받을 수 있는 길이라고 생각합니다. 

(끝으로) 남의 일처럼 방관자적으로 말씀하시는 분들도 계세요. 하지만, 힘있는 누군가에 의해 혹은 언론의 횡포에 의해 선량한 한 사람이 죄인이 되고 이 세상에서 멀어지고 잊혀진 존재가 되는 이런 무서운 일이 또 일어나지 말란 법이 없습니다. 그 일이 우리에게는 혹은 우리가 아끼고 사랑하는 사람들에게는 예외인 절대 일어나지 않을 일이라고 할 수 있을까요? 불행히도 박봄 스캔들을 바라보는 제가 느낀것은 그렇지 않다는 것입니다. 죄 없는 한 사람이 이렇게 간단히 묻혀버리고 잊혀질 수 있었다니. 그런 일을 당하는 당사자가 된다면 어떨까요. 크고 작음을 떠나 도움의 손길이 간절할 겁니다. 이 글을 읽으신 분들이라면 관심을 가져주시고 댓글에도 내용이 많으므로 꼼꼼히 읽어봐 주셨으면 하고, 여전히 무지한 채로 '마악복용'이나 '마약밀반입'등의 허위사실을 유포하고 박봄에게 인신공격을 계속 하고 있는 분들을 만나면 친절하고 따끔하게 짚어 주시기 바랍니다.
=
한 스타일은 어울리는데 곡은 안 어울릴 거라 생각했는데 개지린다 아 진짜 개오져 괜히 박봄이 아님 노래로 절대 못 까 미쳤어...
=
여러명의 노래를 혼자 다 장악하시네
괜히 3대 소속사 출신이 아니셔 대단쓰
=
노래 흥난다
=
No doubt if 2ne1 made a comeback, the other girl group might take a break, because it's obviously the 2ne1 will shake the world.
=
투애니원 딱 한번만 더 보고싶다 진짜 박봄도 좋지만 여기에 씨엘도 있고 공민지도 있고 산다라도 있으면,, 하게되네
=
목소리는 전성기 그대로네여.    
    솔직히 아이돌경연이라 외모적요인도 투표에 은근 영향있을것같은디
  박봄같은 경우 솔로 + 리즈 시절 외모와의 격차로 본의아니게 핸드캡가지고 참여하는셈.
  근데 노래시작하자마자 그런것 다 잊힘.
  투애니원때도  목소리에 사람을  집중시키는 힘이 있었는데 그 품어디 안가네
=
와 역시 박봄 어디안갔네 클라스가...ㄷㄷ
=
She's the oldest and she's doing it solo guys. Its like an army vs 1. 
Good job Bom. This song became so powerful.
=
치타쌤 지낮 존나멋있다 하하하 하는것도 존나..으악

The fact that she’s doing it solo and the only SOLO artist against other five girl groups is truly power that only a queen can hold. She’s the main vocal to 2NE1 how much more if the three other queens will come out with her 😍😍.
=
박봄+치타 조합에 무대도 존나 잘했는데 본인끼리 말아먹은 러블리즈보다 순위 낮다고??
=
여러명이 부른 노래를 혼자서 다 부르고 춤까지 추고.... 대박 그자체.... 역시 클라스가 다르네
=
VOCALSSSSS!!!
=
솔직히 저기에 있을 짬이가,,, 저 도전이 너무 멋있고 너무 잘한다
=
2:26
=
치타도 너무좋지만 만약 피처링으로 씨엘나왔으면 ㄹㅇ 난리났을듯...상상만해도 소름돋는 조합
=
엠넷이라 순위는 믿거
=
아 중간에 가식적인 감탄사 좀 빼라.. 언제까지 불후의명곡식 편집법 울궈먹을래.. 집중 좀 하고 보자
=
Lion (G)idle
=
これボムちゃんなの？？完全に別人になっちゃった😭
=
You know what would be epic to have park bom to get 2NE1 back on that stage.. and then reunited. That would destroy all of the other girls groups. Just saying team 2NE1 forever
=
박봄이랑 치타랑 무대를 만들었는데 5위라고? 지랄ㄹ좀 작작해라
=
What if... She called CL and asked her to do the rap? Omg
=
2nd generation kpopper here 

I miss 2NE1 so much Bom's voice is so unique
=
She can totally do a comeback like this 🔥 this concept will suite Bom pretty well
=
전소연이 치타쌤이다 할때 왜이렇게 좋지
=
♣️♦️♠️♥️
=
Some of yall wont understand that she is singing alone and she have to move her ass all by herself unlike other groups they can focus each member like Mamamoo each had a minute then rest.. this also goes to other group not hatin them or somethin... But respect the effort that Bom gives..💘💘💘💘
=
진짜 블핑한테 박봄을 주입시켰구나 로제?였나 걔한테 딱 이 영상에서 박봄이 부르는 창법?이 똑같네
=
the fact that park bom makes this  show popular among non kpop fans. well, her power
=
Let her sing with her girls let's  see who will dominate queendom
=
혼자라서 불리한건 둘째치구... 딴팀들 보면서 얼마나 옛날 생각 날까....ㅠㅜ 무대올라가서 흥오르면 걍 아무것도 안보인다둔뎅 ㅠㅜ투애니원도 한번 뭉쳐죠.......
=
You can tell how great of a performer she is. She is using everything she's got to rock that crowd.
=
이게 5위??? 나머지애들 그렇게 잘부른거같지 않았움...존나 이게 5위? 그냥 대중투표로 하자 ^^
=
I like this version better than the original. Love Cheetah & Park Bom!
=
Seriously bomie is just the soloist , isnt it  unfair ?
Correct me if im wrong tho...
=
편곡 지렸다 진짜 원곡의 느낌이 엄청 조금밖에 안나서 신기함. .
=
just amazing. Park Bom you are a queen and this was epic!
=
Im really disappointed with the result.. it really.broke my heart thinking what.bom felt when he ranked 5th again.. it so.obvious.some people out there want.bom down.. even.g idle who performed 2ne1 fire got the last rank.. it so obvious that SOMEONE didnt like 2ne1, maybe that's the reason why park.bom always.placed 5th.. im so.mad.right.now..

QUEEN BOM IT'S OKAY.. PLEASENKEEP.FIGHTING.. DONT MIND THE.RESULT.. WE BLACKJACKS.AND.BOMSHELLS.ALWAYS.HERE TO.SUPPORT.YOU.. I LOVE.YOU...
=
I feel this version is better than the original version.
=
야 초등학교 축제커버가 4위를 했는데 mama 솔로곡 최초공개가 5위를 했다고..? 엠넷 뭔일이야 정신차려
=
I cant wait for her comeback
=
썸네일 진짜 예뻐서 들어옴...
=
진짜 박봄 존나 사랑해요 ㅠㅠ 언니 날 가져 엉엉 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Start today with HANN again :D LIke a sweet morning coffee ~
=
치타도 진짜 좋았는데 투애니원 나왔으면 레전드 무대 나왔을듯
=
what a beautiful presentation
=
봄 잘한다ㅠㅜㅜㅠㅜ
=
wow park bom really best performance,
=
이게 파~합❤️ 보다 순위가 낮다고 ????
=
이게 5위라니 말도 안된다구ㅠㅠㅠㅜ
=
- my Bommie so beautiful and song perfectttttt !!! 😚😚🙆
=
한 스타일이 박봄님 목소리에스치면 확 달라지네 ㄷㄷ
=
혀빠닥 꼬이는 발성 너무좋다..yg스타일의 원조가 박봄이구나
=
이게 5위라고?  정말 미쳤구나ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄲㄱㅋㄱ
=
she must collaboration with teddy(YG Composer)
=
박봄이 여기서 다른 애들이랑 붙을 레벨이 아니라는걸 다시 한번 느낌
=
진짜 한이 있는 목소리..
=
치타 나왔을때 지민 반응 어땟을까 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
her performance is amazing! Truly legend! She deserve higher ranking not only came with 5th.......
=
저게 뭔 5위야 2위해도 어이없을 거 같은데 ㅋㅋㅋ..
=
Best cover!
=
We love you bommie💖💖
=
썸네일 잘 뽑았당 넘 조앙
=
This show let us see queen park bom..on how good singer /performer she is ,she is a legend🙂💋👸🏻our forever queen❤️

They wont make her win though..sad😔😭😭😭
=
박봄 혼자라서 불리하다는 사람들 있는데... 혼자 나와서 그나마 밸런스 맞는거 같다...저 포스를 어떻게 이겨
=
Hann already was an excellent music, and Bom made it even better! I feel she is so faithful with the lyrics, making every expression deeper and dangerous. Park, I love you the best, your voice indeed have the power to make a regular song become a hit.
=
Keep streaming
=
Keep streaming
=
치타 나오고 설현이 지민 보는거 왜캐 웃김 ㅋㅋ
=
Love bom
Love dara
Love cl
Love minzy
Love 2ne1.
=
최고 !
=
퍼포 없이 혼자 음색으로 채우는 무대이다 보니 모든 그룹 서정적인 발라드를 하지 않는 이상은 퍼포가 눈에 띄는 그룹이 성적이 잘 나올 수밖에 없는 것 같다 그래도 한이랑 박봄 잘 어울렸는데...
=
QUEEN 👑 #PARKBOM ♥️
=
박봄 버전으로 음원 내줘요..
=
난 사랑에 빠졋다
=
솔직히 봄은 살이 있는게 더 예쁘고 귀여움
=
You should be number one or two or three
=
3위 이상 할줄 알았는데..
=
이건 봐도봐도 그냥 놀랍다
그러고 약간 산범님 박봄닮아서 찾아본건데 박봄한테 입덕할덧가툼....
=
5위는 아무리 생각해도 납득이 안된다
이 무대가 어떻게 5위야 
그냥 자기곡으로 만들었는데...
=
박봄은 진짜 여왕같아... 한 명으로 압도돼
=
박봄편인 사람 손
^^
=
난 이게 1등이라고 생각했는데 5위 무엇..ㅋ
=
Ela tá dublando? :(
=
I love her voice and her style
=
Goosebumps 😍😍😍😍😱
=
지민 치타 친구 사이 아니였나
=
I never really listened to 2ne1 but I feel like her voice sounds a bit shaky idk if that’s just me or her voice in general and pls don’t bash me about this
=
Yeaaaaaaaaaah
=
와 그와중에 키를 높여 부른것에 주목해야 합니다... 갓봄👍👍
=
I think if its CL she could be the top..but no hate on cheetah she's best..
=
cl랩하고 공민지 춤추고 산다라박 센터서있으면 지금참가팀 못비빈다ㅋ
=
이 프로그램 끝나기 전에 제발 한번만 2ne1 완전체로 한곡만 하자ㅠㅠ 나 진짜 오열할듯ㅠㅠ 너무 보고싶고 너무 그립다!!
=
I like how it sounds like her own song and not G-idles if you get what I mean...
=
이전 화 에서 박봄 실력문제란 얘기 있어서 찾아보고 마이크 문제라고 댓글 달았는데 답글로 무시하는 사람들 꽤 있더니..
이번 무대에서 팩트랑 클라스 제대로 보여 주는 것 같아서 뿌듯하다.
박봄 팬은 아니고 아이들팬이었는데 오히려 박봄 스타일이 오져서 노래에 빠졌음.
실력 오지네
=
the fact that the competition is for Queendom and most 2ne1 fans wish 2ne1 will be completed someday but BOM is representing as solo artist now and she is really strong to compete to other girl group. Hope the 2ne1 fans back her up to stay in competition even if she doesn't win for the no. 1 spot, the exposure and being relevant of all time is what important and gain popularity as solo artist as BOM. Seeing her performance back on stage again proves that she still has it, her unique and powerful voice makes her different from other artist. Hope she will have this kind of genre upbeat pop music on her next song full album.
=
Who said she cant pull off even tho she's a solo artist bish she's a member of 2ne1 she can do it
=
전소연은 되게 묘하겠다. 자기가 만든 노래에 자기 랩 스승님이 피처링 해주니까 되게 기분 묘할것 같애
=
박봄이 춤을 못추는 건 아닌데 살짝 부자연스럽게? 어설프게 춘다해야 되나 좀 그런게 있는데 그 박봄 특유의 몸짓이 진짜 매력있고 귀엽다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Park bom get 5th place again with this performance
=
솔직히 이번에 박봄 1위해야한다 진짜 소름 노래
=
눈쪽 큐빅 눈물 방울 같아서 반짝일때마다 눈물 고인채로 이 꽉물고 노래하는거 같다 ㅠㅠ
=
소연이 진짜 행복했겠다....... 자기가 만든 곡을 대선배님이ㅠㅠ
=
미친 닭살돋음
=
박봄 음색은 참 힙하면서도 고급진..정말 귀한 음색이다 ㅜㅜ 못잃어 진짜 계속 노래해줘요
=
Is that 2NE1 sign at the end??? huaaaaaaaa... *calling all the blackjacks*
=
와 퀸덤 기획의도이제 알거같음 나이제 퀸덤처돌이될듯
=
3:01, 3:47
=
😍😍😍😍
=
0:35 those dancers holding the whole kpop industry on their lap.
=
Bom kuhhh...
=
난 이노래첨듣는데 원래  박봄노래같이 찰떡이네....    넘  멋이따....  며칠째  보는지...!!
=
A Bom me da arrepios!! Ela é tão talentosa!! Uma rainha!! Meu bebê!!💜💜💜 Te amo Park Bom!!💚💛
=
Boomieee❤❤❤😟
=
마마무도 박봄도 곡이 좋아서 운이 좋아서 성공한게ㅜ아니라 성공할 애들이였구나 싶네 각자 개성이..노래가 개성있던게 아니라 저 사람들이 그렇게 노래를 만든거구나 싶다. 박봄 솔로곡 봄도 진짜 좋은 곡 받아서 솔로 잘됐네 했는데 이거보니까 뭔 곡을 해도.. 평타 이상은 했겠다...
=
이거 1등할만한건맞지만 2차경연에 1등할만하다할 무대가 넘많이나옴... 너나해도 한도 데스트니도 전부 1등할만한 무대라...근데 5위인건 너무하다...아니...*블*즈 보다 낮은건 좀아닌것같은데
=
대기실 가수들 시선만봐도 순위가 어떤지 짐작이 가는데.. 집중해서 보는시선 vs 재롱보듯 재밋게 즐기는시선 정말로 조작이 안되었다 자신할 수 있을까?
=
Put it in 1.25 speed, thank me later.
=
대체왜 순위가낮은거임??..난솔까말 1등일줄알았음
=
(g)idle is so smart to let Park Bom cover their song. And now Hann covered by Park Bom ft Cheetah is on itunes top charts on different countries!!! 💚💚💚
=
5th rank?don't care
Legends?only
=
솔직히 박봄 별론데.. 얼굴이 너무 이상해 진것도 그렇고 노래할 때 가사 뭉게는것도 그렇고... 근데 이번 노래는 진짜....인정할 수밖에 없네요. 왜 순위가 낮은지 도저히 이해할 수 없을 정도로.
=
WOW BOM
=
Whhatt we reached 7.8 M viewss!!! Wow hahhaha
=
Where's ParkBom?? Wearing red dress is her?? I thought that was a Queen though. ♠♥👸♦♣
=
박봄은 실력으론 못깐다
=
The song like her own, I love it!
=
My first thought seeing her perform was "Queen"
=
MARAVILHOSa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
She deserve first place
=
Cheetah＆Bom 
The costumes and makeup are wonderful and you may fall in love at first sight!!💄💅💗✨
💕👫💕
=
I really loved this remix but I really didn't appreciate the g-idle's cover. I don't know if I'm alone
=
She is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING !!! PLEASE DONT LET HER ALONE !!!
=
Loved this performance so much! after AOA, this and OMG's performance were my second choice!
=
0:22 Soojin no move hahaha so Freezer girl i love it
=
I like Boms version better! More up my Alley!
=
치타 랩 진짜 쫀-득 하네 뭐 어쩌겠다고 부분 지려버려
=
2:55 이때 싱긋 웃을때 미모 진짜 터짐 와,,,진짜 이쁘다
=
봄아 정말 무대 짱이었어❤❤
항상 응원해 사랑해❤❤
=
2:44 젤 선배같애 ㅠㅠㅠㅋㅋ
=
2:26 존나귀여워ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
perfeita demais :(
=
이 무대가 5위라는게 너무 이해안가요ㅠㅠㅠ
누가봐도 노력한거 보이고 실력도 진짜 실력자 중 실력자인뎅ㅠㅠ
=
난 이노래 좋은데 ㅠㅠ 왜 5위했을까ㅠㅠ 진짜 아쉽다..
=
귀여웡ㅠㅠㅠ
=
난 솔직히 너무너무 잘해서 상위권일줄 알았는데
좀 아쉽
=
퀸덤에서라도 2ne1보는게 소원이에요ㅠㅜㅠ
=
와ㅠㅠㅠ진짜...갓봄....신이에요ㅠㅠㅠ 아이들도 노래에 색깔이 없는 그룹이 아닌데 진짜 거의 다 빼고 중요한것만 남기고 박봄으로 채워넣었어...어떻게 저렇지? 대단하다ㅠㅠ
=
하 몇번을 다시 봄♥️ 봄♥️
=
씨벌 엠넷 엿먹어 ㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎㅋㅎ
=
Omg! Favv Park bom❤️
=
아 치타 너무 멋있어 왜 댓글에 치타얘기느 ㄴ없어
치타 랩 지대로 들어본거 첨ㅇㄴ데
너무 좋아 너무 먹있어 오빠 너무 사랑해요
아 참 죄송해요 치타언니 넘 멋잇어서.....
=
Linda❤❤
=
2:45 저두 돋았습니다... 선풍기틀고 있었는데 하나도 안 추웠는데 마지막에 하하하 듣고 소름 쫙
=
I'M IN LOVE WITH CHEETAH I'M DONE
=
#LEGENDARYQUEENBom 🔥♥️♦️♠️♣️
=
저건 2 , 3 위 해도 이상하지 않겠네
=
박봄 항상 응원해요 ㅜㅜ 불리하면 불리하다 할 수 있고, 약쟁이, 성형괴물 등등의 비난과 악플을 받으며 스트레스를 받고 힘들어 하지만 전 항상 응원해요
=
3:48 사이다 사이다 사이다 사이다
=
역시 박봄~~!!  지렸다
=
퀸덤을 안봐서 몰랐는데 
그 빠아압~~! 하던 러블리즈가 4위고 박봄이 5위라는게 실화인가요..?
=
목소리랑 노래가 너무 잘 어울림
=
저렇게 혼자 무대를 꽉 채우고 무대 돌아다니면서 지친 기색없이 편하게 하는건 박봄뿐일 것이다.. 경력차이라는 건가 대단,,
=
If allowed international voting I guess Bom is always 1st
=
우리 맘속엔 1위야 뽐여왕
=
치타랑 가까운애들이 둘이네 지민 소연 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
박봄 노 박볼(박 볼따구)
=
치타 존멋이다...
=
자신이 만든 노래를 대선배가(심지어 프듀 선생님까지!!) 부르는 소연의 느낌은 어떨까...
=
생긴거 너무 부담
=
난개인적으로 원곡보다 훨씬좋다고생각된다 날마다 듣고있는데 진짜 음색깡패
=
순위는 무의미~~~ 어차피 팬덤이 크면 유리한듯. 일반 방청도 있는 것 같던데~~ 그래봐야 팬들도 일반 방청 가는 듯~ 5년이나 휴식하고 나오고도 대단한거지~ 그냥 쭈~~욱 즐기자!
=
ㅁㅊㅅㄲ들이..보는눈이 없는거지.
젊은애들이 투표했나.;
=
솔직히 다 좋은데 치타 파트로 넘어갈 때 이상하게 힘 쫙 빠지는 느낌이랄까
=
경연하랬더니 연말시상식을 만들어놓고 갔네
=
Love park bom
=
Please put the Arabic translation❤️

I don't understand English or Korean but I use Google translator
=
개멋있어,,,,,,
=
LET'S GO FOR 8,000,000 VIEWS
=
아니.. 박봄 이렇게잘하고 혼자서 하기힘들텐데 혼자 소화 다하는데 왜 맨날5위하는겨? 이거 너무 팬점수가큼.... 다른사람들도 잘하는데 박봄은혼자하는데 저렇게잘하는데...
=
그냥 울 봄언니 보고싶어서 보는거지
=
진짜 다른 애들은 모르겠는데 박봄은 5위 이해 안 감
=
댓글을 사용할 때는 타인을 존중하고 커뮤니티 가이드를 준수해야 합니다.
=
원곡 궁금해서 찾아봤는데 . . .  음
=
박봄 진짜 혼잔데 존재감이....말도 안된다 역시는 역시
=
that voice can make any song sound like her own original
=
동영상으로 보는거랑 현장 분위기는 많이 다를 수 있다고 생각함 ㅠ
=
투애니원 메보의 저력을 무대에 다 쏟아부어줬으면 좋겠다 경연생각하지말고 멋진공연보여주세요ㅜㅜㅜ 순위로 안보여줘도 충분히 대중들은  박봄님좋아해요♡♡
=
Amazing
=
3:42
=
Wiped out!
=
And again Park Bom is 5th.. *THIS IS NOT FAIR*
=
Even lose or win, u are the queen !
=
Queen is back.. She did 2NE1 sign in the end 😭
=
Não consigo parar de assistir está apresentação da park bom.
=
IF MNET PLAYS BOM DIRTY IDK WITH THE WHOLE INDUSTRY ANYMORE
=
진짜 보면서 한 다섯번은 소름돋은듯 박봄스타일 ? 로 바뀐게 눈에 보여서 너무 좋았고 그냥 박봄 목소리 짱 그래 가수는 자신의 색으로 노래할때 젤 강력한거지 ..... 넘 멋있다
=
Is that jimin?
=
지민이랑 소연이 얼굴이 나오는게 나는 너무 재밌음
지민이는 예전에 언랩에서 치타한테 엿먹어 한 적도 있고 소연이는 프듀 쌤이었고ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
지민이 표정이랑 소연이 좋아하는 거 보는게 너무 재밌었음
=
Getting cheetah to guest perform for your song is so OP like pulling out a super rare from a gacha game wtd
=
역시 박봄
=
한도 개성있는 노래라 커버 힘들었을것 같은데 역시 보컬실력매력 어디 안가구요..
=
30대 아줌마된 저로썬, 이곡이 박봄곡인줄알았네요..  yg나왔죠? 누가뭐라던 얼굴이 어쩌구하던말던 자신감갖고 재기하길빌어요. 실력 삭히기엔 정말 아까워요. 치타가 밀린 느낌들만큼 목소리자체에 포스도 있는데.
=
0:47 자아성찰 ㅇㅈㄹㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
How to slay the stage!

Park bom: hold my corn.
=
치타나왔을때 머리스타일 화장법
언프리티랩스타생각났는데 지민이젤반가웠겠다
=
Cheetah did great but imagine if that was CL. I would cry!!!
=
모든 가수들이 1차 경연보다 2차 경연때가 더 오지는 듯ㄷㄷ 진짜 이갈고 한거 보인다 생방보면서 박봄이 학춤 출 때 넘 멋져서 소름돋음ㅠㅠㅠ 마지막 투애니원 포즈 뭔가 슬프기도 하고.. 언니 넘 최고야
=
CAN SHE COME BACK WITH A BADASS SONG LIKE THIS? IT FITS HER SO MUCH SUCH A QUEEN
=
박봄은 저기 끼어있을 급이 아닌데 순위 상관없이
=
그래 박봄은 박봄이지 클라스 어디 안가네ㄷㄷ
=
보석이다. 잠시 위축됬었는데 소속사에서 다시 빛나게 도와주는거 같다. 다시 엄청 반짝일 봄 🙏 투애니원들 다시 빛나자ㅠ
=
진짜 보면 볼수록 왜 5위 했는지 이해가 안가서 본방 볼 때 소리지르다가 한대 맞았는데
=
I'm getting goosebumps. It's like she runs the stage and it's a whole new song. Ain't complaining tho.
=
I love Bom and I love how she made it her own song but I lowkey wished it was CL preforming with her 😢
=
식스센스 부른애들보단 높을거라고 생각했는데 ㅌㅌㅌ
=
This is gotta be an unreleased 2ne1 park bom solo song
=
Let's talk about beauty and vocals, let's talk about Park Boom
=
She covering for 6 voice and u expect her to dance like other group? If park bom left the show i will stop watching..
=
다른 곡들은 "원곡 들어보고 싶다!" 이건데
이거는 전혀 아니어서 색다르게 좋다 역시 투에니원
=
2ne1팬들이 다투표하면 저기 아이돌분들 다합친거랑 맞먹는다는 설이...
=
박봄 스럽게 딱 맞게 했다고 느껴지고

박봄 음색은 넘사벽
음색으로 듣는 가수 

치타가 아니라 CL였다면 어땟을까
=
They're  doing BOM dirty ; honestly she is doing it alone  and rocking the  stage but still placing low because the  audience is so biased toward their own groups  .... Iam salty as hell no denying it!!
=
We need 2ne1!!!!!!
=
박봄은 미니앨범으로라도 살려주면 안되나?
=
Her voice is really cute !! #2ne1 #BlackJacksforever
=
나는 왜박봄이 한게 더 느낌이좋냐
=
I'm so tired of her getting low rank like wtf???
=
She deserves higher ranking— I hope this doesn’t discourage her or disappoint her in any way. I would like to believe she has a strong spirit to let some rankings get in her way👏
=
i can't wait to see her and Hyojung joining forces to sing a ballad on the next challenge
=
Park Bom doesn't need a contest or some sort of a competition to prove that she's a queen. A real queen would humbly bow down to give chance to the new generation of artists. Just saying.
=
Can't believe she's ranked 5th. With this showmanship plus the appearance of Cheetah. Grr
=
IM SO HAPPY BOM TEAMED UP WITH CHEETAH !
=
4:09 es tan tiernaaaa ❣💕
=
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ진짜 어이없다 저 무대가 어딜봐서 5위냐고 진짜ㅜㅠㅠ 박봄언니 혼자 얼마나 열심히 무대했는데.. 아 진짜 내가 다 화나 진짜..
=
박봄 존나 잘했는데 왜 5위야 진짜 이해할 수가 읎네 ㅜ
=
No me canso de verla :3
=
5위?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 러블리즈 여러명 보다 박봄 한명 무대가 더 인상깊다; 그리고 박봄은 지금 37살임 ㅋㅋ 깜이 안됨 . 걍 무대로만 봐도 말도 안돼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
4:11 still 2ne1
=
That's the veteran we talking about ✋👏
=
2:18 치타 랩 파트 목소리 완전 멋있다
=
I love her voice sooo much.
=
Yepp the baddest fighter in this show, this is what pp call Legendary
=
5th place? Again? YGGGGGGG 
i mean MNETTTTTTTTTTT😤😤😤
=
It is not a fair competition Bom ranked 5 again ? Duh🖕🏻
=
진짜 박봄은 자기 노래로 만드는 능력이 있는듯 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ엉니 그런 김에 그 능력으로 저도 언니꺼하면 안되나요 엉엉
=
개잘했는데 이 무대가 어떻게 5위냐 곡해석 갖다버린 파~압♥보다 이게 아래라고?????
=
이 무대 너무 좋게 봤는데 왜 5위냐 ㅠㅠ
=
4:11 that hand sign represents 😭
=
2:15 you do note is da liar and ma peyk. Anyone from Philippines? 😂
=
어떻게 러블리즈가 4윈데 박봄 언니가 5위야..ㅜㅜ
=
love you so much Bom!!! <3
=
Keep streaming
=
마지막에 님들 손모양 봤음ㅠㅠㅠ??? 저거 투애니원 인사할 때 손 모양이잖아ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 정말 새삼 그립다 투애니원으로 가요계 평정하던 그 시절...
=
오지는데ㅠㅠ
=
이게 왜 5위노..
=
박봄 최고♥️♥️
=
왜 이게 러블리즈보다 낮냐고.. 진짜 이해를 못하겠다 
이 무대보다 식스센스 노래에 윙크가 더 낫다 이거가...
=
언니 너무 이뻐요 최고에요 순위에 연연하지 말아요!! 언니가 제일 잘했어요 보컬도 댄스도 퍼포먼스도!! 좋아하는 음악 ㄱㅖ속 해주세요🥰🎀
=
이게 젤 좋음 👍🏻
=
음색 역시 개성있어 박봄최고.
=
박봄 목소리를 전소연이 프로듀싱 맡아서 딱 폭발시키는 무대 진짜 한번만 보고싶어요
포인트 잘 잡아서 딱딱 힘있는 목소리로 폭발하게!!
=
파압~♡ 보다 억만배 좋은데 와
=
Its really sad she's rank 5 again 😔
=
Is intern allow to vote ?
=
아 또 보러왔네
음원도좋지만 역시 영상이 최곤듯
=
너무 잘해주셨는데!! 올만이라 너무 반가웠는데 티비에서 더 자주 뵙고싶어요!
=
this versión of han is the best !!! Bom is the queen
=
역시 투애니원이 다르구나 그냥 박봄노래자녀!
=
센언니 둘.. 봄치타... 함부로 덤빌 수 없는 조합
=
아 박봄 언니 사랑해
=
If there was an international vote PARK BOM already won😉😍
=
표정도 퍼포먼스도 제일 자연스러운데 ㅠㅠ
=
썸네일 존나 이뿌당
=
원곡보다 좋으면 어쩌자는거
=
갠적으로는 이게 짱이라고 생각했는데 왜 5위죠...?
=
대박인데.. 이게5위했어? ㅜㅜ헐
=
이게 5위래; 어이 없어 최소한 3등은 가야 정상이지
=
보컬 장난아니다....
=
러블리즈 또 6위 하고 떨어짐 안되니까 혼자 무대 장악하는 박봄 밑으로 만든다고 ?? 진심 러블리즈가 6위로 떨어져야지
=
헉!! 여자아이들 '한'애정하는 노래인데..
커버곡으로 완전 박봄의 '한'이 되버렸네..
박봄 혼자서 정말 잘해줬네요.
멋지다!!!
=
박봄 음색 최고다
=
목소리가 두꺼운? 힘있는 목소리인데도 딕션은 날카롭게 딱딱 잘들려서 좋아요🥰🥰
=
Can't believe this is 5th. Smh.
=
이번 퀸덤5화 보면서 느낀건데 박봄 편집한거 보면 은근 박봄 까는것들 있던데 좀 인상 찌푸려짐....;;;,
=
와 가창력
=
우기 외국인 맞나요 리액션도 걍 한국인인데ㅋㅋ
=
AND KIDS, THIS IS HOW ITS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE💋🤩
=
好可憐....
=
진짜 상위권에 들어도 모자랄판에 5위라니;;
ㄹㅇ 엠넷은 욕먹고 싶어서 프로그램을 만드니
=
원곡 모르는사람이보면 박봄노래라고 생각할거같음;;
=
Park Bom deserves the world I love her
=
Omo 😍😍😍
=
썸네일 나만 핑구같음? 기엽네
=
아니 이거 라이브맞음? 노래 개잘...
=
2:12
=
Park Bom deserves to be no. 1 on this performances
=
3위 정도는 할줄 알았는데 ㅠ
=
those backup dancers need some work
=
2:56
3:01
3:48
=
봄 누난 솔로로도 훌륭하지만 항상 멤버들 그리워하고 팀구호 외칠때마다 눙물 쏟아진다ㅠㅜ.. 
제발 여기서라도 완전체 나와줬으면 하는 꿈같은 희망을 가져봅니다ㅠ 화이팅!
=
마지막에 손으로 투애니원 표시하는 거 왜 이렇게 눈물 날 것 같지
=
그냥 아이들 입장에선 대선배가 커버해주는것 자체가 영광이지..
=
아이돌계에서 탑1위까지 올라갔다가 한순간에 바닥서부터 시작하는기분 겪어보지않는이상 정말모를일일듯..박봄이 마음단디먹은게 느껴진다..
=
Miyeon is so proud of her sunbaenim i can see , when she said she became a singer because of Park Bom 😍😍😍
=
이게 어딜봐서 5위야!!!! 아이들은 왜 또 6위인데ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ파압파압 하던 그룹 어디갔오?
=
This is park bom that i know, yg artist esp 2nei1 and Bigbang really an idol who made us enjoy what they perform and i mean we really enjoy the music not the visual not the dance not the clothes, Its just gave you an happiness feelling
=
*These Queendom performances are going to save kpop this year*
=
역시 국내 최고 인기를 얻은 뮤지션들은 다르긴하다. 포스부터 ,노래 소화능력까지;;
=
THE NUMBER OF TIMES I’VE WATCH THIS IS UNHEALTHY
=
곡을 소화한다는게 이런거구나..... 다른커버보면 자꾸 원곡 생각나던데 봄꺼는 원곡 뭐였는지 생각 안나고 자연스러운 느낌 대박 ㅠㅠ
=
진짜... 원곡이 기억안남 걍 박봄 노래인데...?와.... 진짜 보컬 개사기인데 거기다 치타까지 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ치트키 조합아닙니가 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I love Cheetah. She's fantastic. But can you imagine if she had brought CL or Minzy out to do the rap piece?
=
Bom to YG- *DO YOU REMEBER WHEN 2NE1 DISBANDED? DO U REMEMBER WHEN YOU LEFT ME HANGING*
=
첫소절부터 소름이네;
=
아모르겠고 저기 걍 2ne1 완전체 다나와서 순삭으로 이겨줬음 좋겠다
=
이게 음색왕 10년차 박봄이다ㅠㅠㅠ 와씨 이 노래를 이렇게 소화할 수 있는 사람은 박봄 밖에 없다, 진짜. 이거 완전 아이들 노래라고 생각했는데 박봄도 본인 노래인 것처럼 소화해버리기 오졌다
=
The best
=
ㄹㅇ박봄 솔로 무대 같았음 보는내내 박봄노래라고 느껴질 정도로 잘 해줘서
=
이게 어떻게 5위임?? 엠넷 개미쳐ㅛ네 러블리즈가 더 못했는대 무슨
=
She did the 2ne1 pose at the eeeeend.. 😭 I'm crying. 😭

If I didn't know that G-idle is the original singers I would be mistaking this as her own song.
=
omg cheetah putting a verse into soyeon’s song after she mentored and rooted for her in pd101 when soyeon was just a trainee 🥺🥺🥺 i’m cry
=
노래가 좋아서 그런지.. 박봄무대가 가장 기억에 남고 보고또보게 되는 무대.. 열번은 더 보고 있음
=
2NE1 vibes. 😱 She just made a comeback to the fierce and girl crush style.
=
Is she placed 5th again?? WHY? I DONT UNDERSTAND
=
The 2ne1 sign at the end is very important and Bommie seems to enjoy the stage and that too is important and I was scared for her when she signed up for Queendom but it seems that nothing can hold her back. I've seen so much improvement and it's the only 2nd ep and I love that she is trying to get back to where she used to be but I believe that she will soar higher and higher. 2ne1to infinity and beyond. Bommie you will always be our number 1.
=
BOM transformed this song to hers!! She deserves a bigger stage!!
=
I think this deserves to be on the Top 3 at least. I mean, this is a really great cover and that's what round 2 is all about right? She put her own flavor into Hann and it sounds amazing. Nevertheless, whatever their rank is, they're all great. And Park Bom? She doesn't need to prove anything. Being in this show is only a reaffirmation that she's a great performer and it's always great to see her do everything with passion.
=
비긴 어게인 나왔으면 좋겠다
팝송도 장난아니게 부르던데....
=
The fact that this performance at the 5th place, just BIG F!!
RYFKM!?? I expect at least she got one higher rank, DANG MNET!
=
just look at soyeon being super happy bcoz her song is getting covered by a veteran park bomband trainer cheetah!! 💞
=
She always mentioned 2ne1 😭 she even do the 2ne1 sign ag the end 😭😭😭
=
well, if boom left the show then i stop watching this
=
Park bom on fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
=
I'm from Thailand.😂
=
Love Park Bom and 2NE1 so munch👑🌸❤️❤️
=
it's remind me of 2ne1 days .
=
I love this version more than original one but respect the one that original
=
봄아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
This is Bom my queen 💖 i miss her voice 💖💖 one of the k artist who have unique voice
=
OMYGOODNESS!! This version is so *POWERFUL* 🔥🔥🔥 #Blackjacks #ParkBom #QueenBom
=
Thats only Park Bom performing. What if all of 2ne1 members performed on that stage? THAT WOULD BE VERY EPIC!!!!
=
진짜 박봄 볼땨마다 ㅠㅠ 너무 불쌍함
=
퉤니원 나머지 세명 다 데려와죠 ㅠㅠㅠ....😭😭
=
1~2위 해도 이상하지 않을 무대였는데 5위 하니 안타깝다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 다음 무대는 3위안에 들면 좋을꺼 같다
=
박봄 너무너무 기여워 ㅜㅜ❤️❤️사랑해요 언니❤️❤️
=
I love her and I always support her from your fan Park Bom
=
원래 박봄님 팬 아니였는데 이거보고 진심 반했다ㅠㅠ
=
Keep fighting unnie remember you're 2ne1 we blackjacks are still here to support y'all.
=
존나 이해 안간다 솔직히 러ㅇㅇㅇ보단 훨훨 잘했다 혼자인데도 무대 꽉채우고 존나 아이들도 왜 6위인지 모르겠고;
=
이거 라이브임 mr제거 보고오셈
=
Keep streaming
=
이 날 의상이랑 메이크업 진짜 박봄님한테 찰떡 완전 잘 어울려요 역대급 찢었다 ㄹㅈㄷ라는 말밖에 무대 완전 제알 좋다
=
와 지렸다 봄언니 사랑해요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 근데 이게 5위라고? 참나..
=
혼자 무대 꽉 채우네~~ 박 봄 노래 같당~~ 잘한다~~ 멋있어~~
=
박봄은 멤버 없이 혼자여도 존재감 갑이다... 목소리에서부터 그냥 쩔어 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
i love this
=
언프1 : 치타, 지민
프듀1 : 치타쌤, 소연
=
박봄도 좋아죽~!!!겠는데!!
치타 렙이 너무 섹시해서 또 치여 죽겠다 ㅠㅠ
=
순위는 무시하고
실력 진짜 쩐다 
대박~박봄
=
후배들 리액션 영혼리스
ㅋ
=
박봄 진짜 목소리는 대박....완전 자기 노래 같네
=
Queendom? I only know QueenBom!
=
Amazing voice
=
우리 봄이 최고야 언제나 어디서나 항상 응원해
=
노래도 좋고  진짜 나와주는거 자체가 넘 고마움...  언니 자주봐요 ㅠㅠ
=
럽리 분들도 나름 예쁜 무대였는데 사실 이게 5등이라는게 믿겨지지않아 엠넷 박봄 미워하나...?
=
진짜 이거 박봄님 목소리도 너무 좋아서 들으러 오는데 치타님 랩하실때 진짜 개발려
=
와 43번쯤 들으러왔는데 1도 안질려버리누
=
아이들이 불렀을땐 괜찮네~였는데 박봄 한은 머리속에서 계속 생각나서 영상만 10번 이상 본듯
 음색 너무 좋아
=
她的臉一直讓人分心欸
是不是打太多有的沒的
整個人很不自然
=
just curious, who won this Queendom anyway ?
=
음색은 진짜 독보적이다
=
2:15
=
Cheetah got me shook
=
화사 표정이 말해줌.. 이무대 쩔었음 3:16
=
아니 오늘 퀸덤 재방보고 5위한거 보고 다시 보러왔는데 솔까 처음부터 소름 돋았는데 이 무대가 5위라니 말이 안되는데...
=
힘내~봄아~자존심따위 내려놓고 씩씩하게 혼자 잘해낸거라만으로도 너는 1위다
=
존나 개잘했는데 ;;
=
today, many seems to have forgotten about park bom, i really love her
one time she was very loved, the scandal ruined everything.
i hate yg entertainment, it's like they never cared about her.
her voice is so special, i'm now watching her on queendom, so sad that she's always ranking low, her you and i performance  was a rollercoster of emotions and memories and hann was lit , i really believed she was going to rank in the top 3 (and also, stop mnet making bom looks like she's bad).
she  seems different because of the plastic surgery but her personality, talent are the same.
stop sleeping on the main vocalist of 2ne1;
support her solo career, she really deserve recognition.
she still have that powerful aura around her, that charisma and magnificent stage presence
=
솔직히 이런 거 잘 모르는데 박봄이 1.2등 정도로 멋있었음
=
왜  5위지
=
3:10 승희 넘 귀여워ㅜㅜ
=
엠넷 싫어서 얘네가 하는 방송들 보기싫은데 봄언니랑 오마이걸 때문에 퀸덤만 보는데 좆같다 엠넷
=
대박 멋있다
=
박봄 목소리랑 외모가 엣지 닮은거같기두..
=
지나가던 무무인데 박봄님 너무 멋있어요 다 씹어드셨네요 겁ㄴㅏ잘어울려 남자 멱살 쥐어 뜯으면서 팍씨 찾아오면 죽여버린다 하고 속삭인ㄴㅡㄴ거같다 미친 언니 최고에요
=
겁나 좋은데???? 왜5등??!
=
클라스는 여전하다
=
퀸덤 방청객 솔직히 팬들 분배가 말이 안됨 ㅠ
=
Andito na naman ako.. Hahaha LSS
=
과도한 성형으로... 필런지 뭔지 몰겠지만... 발음 하는데 방해되는 느낌이네요.. ㅠㅠ 근데 명불허전
=
이번 경연이 쟁쟁한 팀이 많았긴 함. 근데  저 무대가 5위할 무대는 절대 아닌데?
=
하루에 한 5번 넘게는 보는 것 같은데 이젠 들을때마다 눈물이나네 미쳤나베
=
3:11 “I forgot I was an idol for a second” hahahhahaha
=
진짜 편곡 누가 만졌나 기가막히다 혼자 솔로지만 끝까지 힘냈음 좋겠다ㅠㅜ 마지막 투애니원 뭉클ㅠ
=
진짜 이번무대로 박봄이 괜히 2NE1이 아니였구나 하는 생각이드네..
막방에 2NE1 완전체 한번등장해주면 좋겠다
=
Park Bom slays🔥🔥🔥 Singing the whole song alone is no joke while doing some choreo. Love you Bommie! The more I see you perform in Queendom the more I thirst for 2ne1 reunion! Please 😥
=
목소리 소울부터가 다른 그룹과는 수준다름을 보여주는데 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Im glad she sing using her own vocal range and didn't follow the original vocal blindly
=
다른 퍼포먼스 보면서 감탄하다가도 결국 여기로 돌아오게되는듯ㅠㅠ 진짜 본인노래처럼 편곡하고 음색도 역시 독보적이예요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom unnie if you can bring the rest of the kids with you, please perform CRUSH. If not, I'm okay with SHAMEFUL. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
=
작작 조작투표해

4위 러블리즈
5위 박봄
6위 아이들
이 말이되냐고 작작좀 하면 안되냐?
=
박봄 목소리가 너무 듣고싶었어 ,,, 아무리 따라해도 따라 잡을 수 없는 박봄만 가진 그 음색
=
럽리보다 낮은건 말이안되는데 아무리 낮게쳐도 4위라고생각했는데
=
Doing 2ne1 handsign after the performance means that BOM never forgets where she came from..
#FoureverQUEENS
=
역시암넷
=
박봄 립싱크로 뭐라 하는데 딴 아이돌들은 그룹이여서 파트 나눠 부르는데 박봄은 혼자서 다 부르잖아...
=
와 이 영상나오고 지금 일주일간 스무번은 돌려보고 듣고 한것같은데 어떻게 5위지.. 무대에 비해 너무 아쉬운 결과다..
=
이 무대가 5위인건 진짜 이해안된다 아이들은 그냥 원곡 그대로해서 실력에 관계없이 6등 먹었다 치지만 이건 진짜 분위기가 독보적 이었는데
=
You know that feeling where you wanted CL to be the rapper?
=
아니 박봄은 여기 왜 있는거임?
=
I think is really unfair that Bom have to perform alone while the other girls perform as a group
=
lol i still don't know how she end up ranking no.5, she definitely deserve more, like at least no.3
=
슬슬 박봄 언니가 무대에 적응하고 익숙해지는게 눈에 보인단
=
편곡 개쩐다... 솔직히 아이들 노래 박봄이 부르면 소화잘할것같았음
=
약쟁이를 왜좋아함?
=
She is out of industry about 5 years, so many things was changed rapidly. She is brave enough to join in this type of competition which the competitors are representative GG of this era ( they're obviously talented, and good performer).  But park BOM has loyal fans that beside her during her proses to gain her another glory. TBH there's so many good performer in this show, but park BOM is special. They can't compete her in Bomshell hearts
=
자꾸 듣게되네
=
와 진짜 말이 안나와.. 넘 잘어울려... 마마무도 잘하고 뭐지 그냥 여기 나오는 사람들 다 잘하는데 굳이 왜 이런 실력자들 데려다가 대결시키지 ? 왜이렇게 죽고 죽이는 서바이벌 같은 이런 경쟁 프로에만 엠넷은 목숨을 거는지 도무지 이해할수가 없다 .
=
ㅅㅂ 자꾸 의심하게 만드네 암넷;; 이게 어떻게 5위고 아이들이 어떻게 6위인지;;;;
=
Park Bom said she was embarrassed to be #5. Bom plz dont be ashamed us international fans love u #blackjack4life #bombshells :)
=
What show is this? I’m so behind in the kpop world lol
=
박봄 빨간드레스 어디꺼에요?
=
Bomshells can now vote Bom on Mnet website. The more social media accounts you have the more votes you can give to Bom ❤️ I set an alarm to vote Bom everyday it only take me less than 5 mins. Sincerely recommend all the blackjack to vote Bom together ❤️
=
Bom slayed it and can we also talk about cheetah? She slayed it too that rap part her gestures her rap and thayt eye that was so good eveb better than this pass mama performances
=
Why her rating is so low?  Come on her performance Is so amazing
=
Imagine how great YG would be if he let his artist be as free as this.. Dang! She just owned the song
=
She’s just singing, walking, not really dancing just having fun but damn she owned the stage! Her presence, her voice, how she interacted with the camera, the song arrangement. It’s enough to know that she’s on a whole another level!!
=
*6명이 부르는걸 혼자서 다 부르는게 제일 대단하다*
=
진짜 다른 아이돌분들도 너무 잘하셨지만 진짜 거짓말 안치고 기본 박봄꺼는 1일1영상 하는거같다 물론 다른 아이돌분들도 너무 잘하셨지만 갠취는 박봄❤️
=
Girl! I thought this was your own original song that’s how good and natural it felt when you sang it! Such stage presence we missed you and 2ne1 but you’re giving us back a little part of what we lost when 2ne1 disbanded. Queen!
=
2:55 THAT SMILE!!! 😍😍😍
=
This deserves top3 honestly
=
Right now she’s spitting fire 🔥
=
I love her so much!!!
=
I love this remix damn much
=
2:55 that smirk-
=
I watched this at work in the office, when no one was around, and i sobbed to myself  quietly as i thought -wow the legend lives onT_T I love BOM so much!!T_T
=
2:27  ㅋㅋㅋ 소연 치타쌤ㅋㅋㄲ 프듀ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Watching queendom just for Bom😊
=
Can someone enlighten me why is dis in the 5th place
=
2:43 너무 어르신이 흡족해하는 추임새 아님 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Style YG haha so cool hann
=
First Solar does Jimin's rap from Puss then Cheetah chimes in with Bom, Jimin must be having Unpretty Rapstar flashbacks
=
2:56 치였다 쎄게 치였다 와 대박
=
3:16 화사 속으로 " 미친...지렸다"
=
표정연기도 그렇고ㅠㅜㅜㅜ 무대매너도 그렇고ㅠㅜㅜ완전 퉤니원때 박봄같음 ㅠㅠㅠ 역시 경력이랑 실력은 어디안간다...;;
=
well what we expect she's queen
=
박봄 무대 너무 좋았고~~ 순위보단 즐깁시다^^ 잘 될때도 안될 때도 있지만 항상 응원함. 개인적으로 박봄이 feat한 레드락-알수 없는 음악가~ 완전 좋아 함!! 그리고 유앤아이 돈크라이 어쿠스틱버젼 말할것도 없고~~ 음색깡패 박봄이 부른 다른 가수 노래 모음 자주 듣는 목록 ^^ 쭈욱~~~~ 즐기면서 오래 노래 합시다^^
=
진짜 음색 같은 것도 너무 좋고 특히 개성있으면서도 중독성 있음 그래서 부러움 노래라는 걸 자신의 스타일로 소화 할 수 있다는게
=
진짜 음색 독보적임. 어떤곡이든 자기옷마냥 소화하해버리고 중독성 강한건 박봄밖에 없을듯
=
Suits her so well !!!!!
=
ICONIC!!!
=
갠적으로 박봄의 한이 더 좋음 ㅎㅎ
=
한명이 저렇게 무대 채우기 진짜 힘든데,, 퀸덤에 다른 그룹에서 멤버 한명이 무대한다고 생각해보면 저렇게까지 무대 못채울듯 연차가 괜히 있는게 아님 진짜 개쩐다
=
짬바 진짜 개쩐다 걍 흡수해버리네...
=
박봄 껌 씹으면서 노래부르냐고 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 발음
=
Who is this girl at 2:29 SHES ADORABLE I LOVE ALL HER REACTIONS TO EVERYONE
=
How is this only 5th when this was first released I thought it would be in top 3
=
오진다~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=
자꾸 계속듣게되네 ㅡㅡㅋ 치타랩부분은 질림.이제 몇년전이랑같아서
=
이 무대가 왜 파합보다 낮냐 ..
=
박봄 특유의 홱홱돌리는 제스처 너무귀여움...
=
여돌노래를 혼자서 무대를 장악하면서 부른다는게 .. 진짜 프로는 프로다 ..
=
이거 들은뒤로 한들으면 박봄목소리가 겹쳐들려.. 음색진짜 대박
=
난 박봄보려고 퀸덤봤었다 레알루
=
한타 존나쎈 조합;;🤔
=
LIPSYNC 🤣
=
인트로에 딱 머리에손 올리고 돌아보는거, 후반하이라이트에 주먹질하고 반대로 도는거 곡 중간에 성큼성큼 걷는거 진짜 킬포인듯 다른 무대도중독성은 장난 아닌데 봄이제일 퀸같은듯

+그와중에 치타랩중독성개오져
=
Fue epico!
=
she deserve to be in 4th place rather than lovelyz. i mean based on the performance not personality,look. no offence for lovelyz's fan.
=
원래 박봄노래같아 ㅋㅋ
=
How does the voting work here in Queendom?
=
치타 왜케 묘하게 구리냐
=
치타 랩 오지네
=
엄청 겸손하고 멋있고 치타 랩 잘헌당 ,,,
=
박봄 멋있어
=
혼자서 그룹노래를 이정도라면...정말 1등줘야한다
=
SHE MADE IT HER STYLE
=
이 마이크로 you and i 를 불렀어야했는데...
=
비록 투표수나 순위는 낮지만 내가생각할때는 지금까지 최선을다하고 최고의 무대였다고 생각함
=
이 무대가 왜 러블리즈 보다 낮은거지...?
=
5위 박봄 6위 아이들
러블리즈보다 밑인 이유는 없다고 생각하는데..
=
5위할 무대가 아닌데 ㅜㅜ 이번 순위 이상함 아이들도 6위하고
=
치타 으애애애애애애아 최고다
=
Is she really singing?
=
3:41
=
2NE1 fingers! RAISE UP!!!
=
YG is SHAKING.
=
솔직히 이런 프로만드겐 잘못임 그러다가 팬들이 싸움 누군 높고 낮고 아이돌 나오는것 좋지만 이런 순위있는 프로 대부분 
안마드면 좋겠음.
=
발음 왜이리 안좋아짐??
=
혼자서 그룹노래를 불러서 무대를 꽉 채우다니 진짜 대단하다는 말 밖에 안나온다
=
*5th place again? she didn't deserve that. she deserves 1st or 2nd. she owned this entire song.*
=
진짜 보면볼수록 아이들도 그렇고 박봄도 그렇고 러블리즈한테 밀릴만한 무대는 아니였는데
=
갠적인 순위로
오마이걸,aoa,박봄 상위권
마마무 중간
아이들,러블리즈 하위권
러블리즈꼴찌가 말이되야는데, 박봄이 5 위인건 말도안되고, pd가 럽리 불쌍해서 꼴찌안시켜준것밖에 말이안되는데
=
Stage presence off the charts here
=
Bom's voice has natural sound effects to it. It's so damn unique it's ridiculous
=
이 무대가 어떻게 5위지 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아무리 심해도 럽리보다 낮은건 말도안된다
=
Wowwww
=
오zzi고 zzi렷다
=
Amee!
=
Now where're the people who called her "ahjumma" in the first episode, huh? see this fire ♥
=
이로써 1차 경연때 음향이 안 좋은게 증명됐다. 역시 박봄은 박봄이네.... 갓...

+ 댓쓴이입니당! 무무로써 맘무보고 이거 봐서 의심을 하나도 안 하고 봐서 죄송합니다. 다시 보니깐 조금 어색한 부분이 다소 보이네용... 만약 제 댓글이 팬들 간의 싸움 혹은 시청자들간의 언쟁거리가 조장되는 댓글이었다면 삭제를 하겠습니다... 댓글을 적어서 죄송합니다 ㅜㅜ 즐거운 추석 보내십시오!
=
This is why she's the pioneer of girl crush concept people. #straightfire
=
Lady and gentlemen this 2ne1’s Main vocalist the most talented and Unique Singer ... M crying TT.TT she went through a really hard time ... now it’s time for her to shine again ... she deserves more and more
=
I  Really like parkbom version....can't stop playing!
=
HAPPY 1M MY QUEEN AND EVERYONE SUPPORTING BOM RIGHT NOW
=
객관적으로 봐서 이번 경연은 진짜 오마이걸 다음으로 박봄이 두번째로 잘했다고 생각함 노래 ㄹㅇ 박봄 노래같다 진짜 찰떡
팬 아닌데 1일 1봄 하러 옴
=
씨엘 엄청 기대하긴했는데 치타님도 후덜덜하죠...
나중에 투에니원 멤버들이랑도 해줬으면 좋겠어용..!! ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

그나저나 봄 언니 음색.... 음색은 진짜 누가 뭐라든  넘사벽이야...ㅠㅠ
=
I still can't get over to this performance of her. I watch it like a million times but bom still awe me. Please blackjack and bomshell, don't stop streaming.
=
리액션 오바액션 가   sick?

영상 업뎃 되고 매일 영상보고 댓글도 확인하고 있어요. 다들 우리 봄 누나 너무 좋아해주셔서 감사해요.
그당시 약 관련일로 앞뒤 안가리고 욕부터 하던 대중들로인해서 활동 중단에 관련없는 약 하려고 성형한다는 이야기, 데뷔한지 한달도 안된 후배의 디스등등.
결국 봄 누나에게 정말 소중하다던 하나뿐이던 2ne1이 없어졌죠.아직도 누나가 2ne1을 지속적 언급을 할때마다 뭉클하고 가슴이 아파요. 

그리고 이렇게 방송에 나와서 팬들에게 웃는 모습, 노래하는 모습 보여줘서 고마워요.
그때 더 적극적으로 부정했더라면 달라졌을까요?
혼자 무대에 오르고 방송중에 4명아닌 1명으로 있는 누나를 볼때마다 걱정되는 팬이 봄누나에게, 그리고 퀸덤을 보고 봄 누나를 좋아해주는 대중에게.
=
다른의미에서 니노래내노래 스킬이넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 원곡모르고 들었는데 마마무랑 에이오에이는 뭔가 퍼포먼스 위주라서 음원 별론데 이노래는 음원으로 들어도될듯ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 맴매무 더 열시미하자ㅠㅠ
=
Movie haha Party girl chimo chimo
=
6 명 노래를 저렇게 혼자서 잘 소화내다니... 역시 박봄은 박봄이다
=
Hey YG look ! What it is ? Yes, a proper Bom solo.
Oh and look at the comments ! Yes people outside Korea who doesn't give a s*** about her prescriptions meds from 10 years ago !
=
박봄은 박봄이다 진ㅁ자 아무리 딴 사람 노래라도 자기 음색이 다 자기 노래로 만들어...ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
코디열일한것보소 최근 본 박봄 중에 젤이쁨 ㄹㅇ
=
Ok but Can we talk about the background dancers for A minute
=
진짜 박봄노래같다 찰떡임
=
4.4 million views and still counting !! Now that's my queen !
=
Am I the only one crying because I miss 2NE1 so much? 😔😔
=
오마이걸 영상에 달려있던 댓글이 생각나는군ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 박봄이 니노래내노래를 시전하셨습니닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
뭔 듣보 개블리즈? 이런애들이 더 높냐 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
more viewssss rode to 9M
=
Can’t believe she only came 5th with this :(
=
진짜 러블리즈보다 훨씬 잘했는데 5등이라니...
=
This makes me mad. How come this performance rank 5th. Are you serious? This deserves #1. No wonder Korean tastes is so weird. Internationally it charted high and most of the views are coming from International fans. This is crazy. They should open international voting. Mnet sucks! Unsubscribe. This is cheap! Unfair! Unjust!
=
OMG.. I could just only cry when she did the finger-sign, 2ne1 sign. 😭
=
백댄서 딱봐도 열명 스무명 되는 거 같은데 그 사이에서도 존재감 개쩐다... 의상도 있지만 진심 카메라랑 하이파이브하는 거나 진짜 솔로로도 6명 채우는 거 보고 대충격 어떤데서는 치타가 이런데 나오는 게 말이되냐하던데 솔직히 요즘 그룹들사이에서 전성기 한참지난 애 솔로로 데려왔는데 그정도는 되지 않나... 학생이라 그런지 박봄은 봄 말고 잘 몰랐는데 진짜 존멋
=
The moment she shouted "You!" lifted my soul up. Goosebumps!!!
=
아니 이 무대가 5위라는게 말이 되나? 조회수는 3위인데ㅋㅠ
=
아니 이해가 안돼;;; 뭔 5위야 미친거냐 그 그룹 보다 아래라고?? 말도 안돼..
=
3:11 that was so funny reaction
=
They all really surprise that the song fit her so well. Gurl that shouldnt be a question. BOM is one of the 4 MOTHERS OF GIRL CRUSH CONCEPT IN THIS INDUSTRY.
=
We all know Bommie’s gonna slay anyway. I’m just here for those honey legs. Like omygaaaad 😍😍😍
=
I just realized it's Jimin and Cheetah's first time on the same show since UPR :o
=
I love watching all of these and seeing how supportive everyone is of one another 💖
=
럽리보다 순위가 낮은 게 말이 됨 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ? 미쳤네 그냥 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 개 웃기누
=
Putting her 5th? they really want to kill boms career .... I feel sad for her, now i get it why we should not put the whole 2NE1 group here...
=
박봄은 이미 음색, 실력, 존재 자체로 다 했어ㅠㅜㅠ 후배들 사이에서 순위에 휘둘리지 말고 즐겨줬으면,, 투에니원 전성기 보고 자란 내 또래들은 무대 자체로 너무 즐거우니까 ❤️ 이번 “한” 무대도 그냥 박봄 음색 하나로 귀가 정말정말 즐거우니까
=
Bommie 4ever - 2NE1 a legend
=
How I wish the special guest is CL
=
There's so much drastic physically changes on her, but not her quality as a singer #claps #love 👏❤
=
1:23 got me everytime... barely able to move her mouth to talk.
=
Forever Queen Bommie!
=
This performance should be top 3
=
how can this still place 5th? im so annoyed.
=
I wish performance' rapper is CL.
=
진짜 마지막라운드때 투에니원 완전체 나와서 무대한번만 해주면좋겠다.. 생각만해도 소름돋앙 
박봄 혼자 부르다가 무대열리고 중간부터 씨엘 공민지 산다라박 나오고 ㄷㄷㄷ 진짜레전드 찍을거같은데 ㅠㅠ
=
분명 치타가 나왔는데 사람들이 박봄혼자 무대했다 하네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ치타가 완급 조절을 좀 하긴 했지만 웬만한 가수들이 치타 쩌리 만들기가 쉽지 않을텐데
=
proud of you park bom.  solo vs. groups. i salute you 😘💪
=
2:55 그저 웃음만 나온다 할때 표정연기 너무 좋고 데뷔전 얼굴 살짝 보이는게 또 너무 좋다.....ㅠㅠㅠ
=
치타 나올 때 소연이랑 지민이가 유독 좋아하는 게 너무 귀여웡 이잉ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 프듀나 언프 둘 다 몇년 전인데도 치타랑 아직도 연락하고 친한가바여 기여ㅜ어ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
박봄이 춤만 잘췄어도 ㅠㅠ 목소리는 압살인데 제스처가 귀욤귀욤 어색어색
=
저 무대가 어떻게 5위받을 무대냐 도대체 이해가 안 된다
=
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ치타 등장에 갈리는 반응
소연(제자): 우아아아!!!치타쌤이따!!대박!!!
승희(팬):허업((책상쾅
지민(서바이벌 라이벌):이욜~~~오올~~~ㅋㅋ
다 개귀여움
=
춤추는거 왤케 귀엽냐 ㅠ
=
전 무대에서는 잘 몰랐는데
이번 무대에서 박봄님이 더 좋아졌어요
앞으로도 좋은 무대 보여주세요♥
=
지민이랑 치타랑 언프에서
디스전 했는데 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ여기서 보다니... 어색하겠다
=
박봄 처음 시작할때 여왕같다
=
야 이건 진짜 개멋지다
=
치타도 좋지만
아주 잠깐 치타대신 씨엘이 나오는 상상을 했다
보고싶네 투애니원
=
와..솔까 인기많은얘들보 박봄이 훨 잘함..ㅋ
=
와 망넷 이번에  썸넬 개이쁘게 나오게해줬네 근데 5등이 말이되냐 망넷 진짜  말도안된다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
진짜 무대장악력이 대단하다. 경력에서 나오는 실력이 말해주는 것 같다. 다 엄청 후배들이라서 나오기 망설였을 것인데 용기내서 나와준거 감사하다.
=
She's a legend after all♥️♥️♥️
=
이 영상을 보러 몇번을 들어오는건지 모르겠다.
=
7.1 m 😍
=
진짜개멋있어요...ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
무대 하나 봤을 뿐인데 콘서트에서 온통 지지고 새벽에 택시 타고 집 들어가는 기분
=
원래가 박봄 치타 듀엣곡 같네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
엉엉엉어유ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
생각해보니깐 지민이랑 치타 디스배틀했었네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 치타가 지민 aoa인거 노려서 가사에다가 에오웩!! 이랬는데 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
아 전소연 어떡해
치타 보자마자 치타쌤이래 너무 귀엽다
=
진짜 박봄 다리 ㄹㅇ 이쁘다 어렸을때 진짜 박봄 다리 만들기 제목으로 엄청 다이어트 난리였는데.. 추억..
=
this deserves top 3 wtf
=
이곡이 왜 5위일까? 어떤곡보단 나을거같은데
=
미쳐 ㅠ̑̈ㅠ̑̈ㅠ̑̈ㅠ̑̈ 너무 좋아 짱이다
=
This performance ranked 5th place? BS!
=
Love u bom!
=
박봄 센스봐...치타오졌다...둘이 어케 너무 잘 어울리자나...
=
박봄 저 옷이랑 메이크업 이쁘다
그리고 빨간 옷 되게 잘 어울린다
=
I am fan of gidle but i got goose bumps she is truly a performer a talent i just love this
=
Just watching this show bcoz of her..
=
wow 7M!
=
아 이거 계속보고싶다 ...
=
왜 아무도 승희 얘기 안하냐 승희 치타 나오자마자 의자 탁탁탁 치는거 ㅈㄴ귀여운뎈ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
치타 개멋져...  표정봐 ㄷㄷ 깔보는저눈빛
=
봄 불러줬으면 좋겠다, 최애곡인대.
=
와 언니 개잘했는데
=
감사합니다
=
2:17
=
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO SEE!
I will never get enough of Bom😍😍 she a queen!
=
어뜩해 중간에 한번도 안놓친거 실화?? 솔로로 저 곡을 어케불러 갓봄이다 갓봄
=
ㄹㅇ 이게 5위했다고? 이해가안가네 정말
=
마지막에 퉤니원 손가락으로 로고.. 퉤니원 잊지 말라고 티비도 나오고 노력하는것 같아서 더 잊고 싶지 않다.
=
와...진짜 박봄은 불호였다가도 아티스트적으로는 심각하게 좋다... 진짜 음색 미침....
=
진짜 이정도면 투애니원 다시 복귀좀 ㅠ
=
That's what you call autotune but w/o edit! Lol💕🔥
=
Just look at Park Bom she is over 30 years old and look at her energy awesome
=
2:16
=
Bom you wanna win ? Do with cL
=
홍진영인줄
=
존예
=
If I didn’t look at the title I would have thought it was Bom’s new comeback !
=
If Mnet just use Park Bom for ratings. I swear to let karma attack you.
=
말도 안돼 어떻게 이게 5위밖에 안되지?;;
=
표현하고 싶은 건 무궁무진한데 아직 몸이 안 따라주는 느낌이다. 그래도 많이 발전했고, 앞으로도 그럴 것이기에
=
Park Bom give justice to HANN thankiu Bommie... And this song n this type of music suits her... She nailed it... I really really does hope both Park Bom n Gidle will doing great on the song.... I need new fandom NavieJacks?
=
아오 진짜 5위라니 똥이야 방구야
=
2ne1 sign at the end of the perform. MY BLACKJACK FELLING IS BACK
=
Not being fan based, but Park Bom’s performance was the best this round
=
박봄 혼자 나왔는데도 이렇게 무대를 꽉 채우는뎨 씨엘 다라 민지 다 있었으면 진짜 터졌을듯 박봄 사랑해요 노래 계속 불러줘요ㅠㅠ
=
박봄은 여기 비빌 클라스가 아냐ㅠㅜㅠㅜㅜ진짜ㅜㅜ제발ㅜㅜㅡ 솔로로 나와줘
=
Open international voting... 😢😢she will definitely on top...
=
I feel like she really deserved better because she changed the sound of the song without changing its value. I really like her version of the song
=
와...원곡은 걍 흑마법쓰는 마녀들이 부르는 것같은데 박봄은 말레피센트같네 한 꽉차있음
=
The most amazing fact there is that shes competing alone while othera are in group. Boms voice are really good that when she cover other singer songs, it turn out good.
=
Please God. I want to see 2NE1 with  4 members again
=
I cant wait for the studio version to be release i want to buy it
=
im watching this in tears while holding a middle finger to YG
=
I hope in the next episode Mnet can reunite 2NE1 together... I miss them...their performance will be very amazing and superb..
=
편곡 개인적으로 제일 좋았음 분위기도. 단체곡을 솔로곡으로 어떻게 하나 했는데 잘했음
=
I lowkey forgot for a moment who's the original singer of this song. And i thoughts its 2ne1's unreleased song or Park Bom's secret track. 🤣😂 she owned it.
=
HOW IS SHE PLACED FIFTH?! this performance is legendary, iconic and beautiful
=
처음 보자마자 너무 좋아서 충격먹고 자꾸 맴돌아서 자꾸 들어와서 보게된다
1:46 별거아닌데 겁나치이네
=
난 박봄이 이노래부르고부터 좋아하게됬음.. 음색 진짜 어쩔..
=
I like this version so much better. The other one is too pop, hip hop and r&b makes it way more powerful 👊🏼
=
i am not a blackjack. but seriously i am impressed by her cool performance. well said, a legend never die.
=
I cried when at the end she made 21's sign with her hand 😭
She is amazing. Qeeen 🌷👑
=
i love her unique voice. with cheetah rap. oh my,love this  😘
=
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME LISTENING TO PARK BOM UNNIE SING AND IM HVVBDFBVDJF WHERE TF HAVE I BEEN

=
Park Bom is so pretty
=

=
The voice is perfect 👍
=
Mexicooooo loves Bom! She killed the stage! I won't overcome this performance!😍 Love you Bommie
=
I miss 2NE1 now.
=
5th place again...
:(
=
I could never get sick of Boms voice. <3
=
Where can I see this tv show? This is so amazing !. Omg I miss 2ne1.... and bom... her voice is so beautiful
=
2:26 전소연 귀여워ㅠㅠ
=
Cheetah my Queennn 😍

진짜 노래 잘한다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 엉엉
=
Vamos boom❤️😍
=

=
(G)I-DLE , PARK BOM more better than LOVELYZ
=
Let's make it 10M views black jacks 😍

=
대체 이게 왜 5등이지 ㅋㅋ 이해가안가네
=
목소리 짱좋다 진짜ㅎㅎ
=
아 진짜 멋있어..
=
3:41 wooooooooaaaaaaaa. Scream!!!!
=
Her ranking must be higher than that group who did a cover of BEG Sixth Sense
=
슈화 귀엽다 ㅋㅋㅋ 너무자러훌려용!
=
She deserves to win.
=
널 잊으리라 우후후~ 이 파트도 해줬으면 기대했는뎅..ㅜㅜ 좀 아쉽지만 편곡한거 진짜 좋긴해욤..
=
2:55 웃는거봐 개이뻐
=
헐...... 박봄 티비에서 자주 봤으면 좋겠다
=
7m? bom alone made this 7m i wonder if the other member perform as well, it will break the internet for a while.
=
ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 너무 오집니다..언니 제 심장가져가세요,,❤
=
이게 5위냐..?
=
5위 말도 안 돼 ㅜㅠㅠ
=
박봄 혼자서 이정도인데 만약 투애니원 완전체 나왔으면...ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
박봄 화이팅❤️❤️❤️
=
이게 어떻게 상위권에도 못든거지
=
박봄이야말로  진정한 실력파 가수다
yg 양사장은 크게  후회할거다 지금의  yg를 있게해준 거기다가 완전 실력파 인재를 놓친거니깐
=
Bom, thank you for sharing with us your talent!!! I’ll never get tired of watching & supporting you. Hwaiting, our queen!! You’re never alone❣️ I love you!
=
박봄 음색이니까 혼자여도 이정도지
=
아진짜 노래가 완전 좋다 ㅠ 완전박봄스타일 ㅠ ㅠ
=
아아아아 진짜 새노래겉당 완전 잘했당>_<♡♡
=
코디 메이크업 잘했다 잘어울림
=
What if CL comes out?  AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
=
치타 나와서 뭐 어쩌ㅎ겠다고 하는 거 너무 멋있다...
=
<3
=
그냥 봄언니노래인줄알았어..
=
개인적으로 옴걸 다음으로 잘했다고 생각하는데,,팬층이 아직은 없어서ㅠㅠ
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
이 화장 엄청 잘어울린다
=
이게 5등이라고?
=
3:11
=
No tea no shame ...but I still can’t believe this performance got N.5 🤷🏻‍♀️ also (G)idel ? I thought Lovelyz the worst also Oh my girl !!! So unfair anyway Bom did her best and she work alone ♥️♥️♥️♥️👑
=
박봄 당신을 사랑했어... 그리고 지금도 사랑해 엉엉
=
It's reminds us of 2ne1
=
Hayo keep streaming
=
Miss u !
=
그냥 샤크라의 한을 하지그랬어^^
=
Win or Lose she's already a Legend together with 2ne1 members.
She really did great here. I love it. Very stable.
=
My dream is that 2ne1 meets for Queendom
=
정말 멋있고 당당하며 사랑스러운 존재다 다른 참가자 그룹들도 너무 잘했는데 박봄이 무대 장악력이 너무 대단하다 한 명이서 100인분을 하는 느낌... 보는데 심장 개뛴다 ㅠㅠ 특유의 그 많은 무대 경험에서 나오는 오우라와 짬밥이 미쳤다 어떻게 사람이 이렇게 무대 체질이지 ㅠ 계속 가수 해 주세요 언니 ㅠ
=
이 실력으로 박봄(님)이 5위를 했다는게 
못믿겠어요..
=
게임속에 나오는 진보스 같음
혼자서 무대 장악력 장난없음..
=
박봄이 여기 나와서 애들이랑 경쟁 할수 있는건 솔로기 때문에 애기들이 박봄한때 겨우 비빌수나 있는거지 2ne1 완전체면 걍 비비긴 레벨자체가 다름
=
Guys pls support her .. She deserve it .. And one day 2NE1 will reunion , 
QUEENS will be back
=
투애니원 완전체 보고 싶네
=
박봄이 부르니까 왜 이리 YG한테 하는 말 같냐 내가 오버하는건가
=
곧 gd 제대하는데 둘이 하나 뽑는것도 보고싶다 ㅠㅠ
=
Please release a studio version!!!!!!!
=
This is only 1/4 2NE1, im gonna die if whole 2NE1 members out *hittttt
=
No one talking about Cheetah's rapp. She slayssss
=
원곡 기억도 안 난다 진짜 너무 잘 커버했다는 말로도 부족하고 그냥 원래 자기 것마냥 저걸 저렇게 불러버리네 원곡 듣고왔는데 이게 자꾸 익어서 이걸로 부르게 됐음... 돌았다 너무 멋있어 노래가 원곡보다도 좋으면 어케 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
This cover dominates iTunes WORLDWIDE with 13 entries!!! I guess Blackjacks Worldwide are still awake and forever will stay with 2NE1!!!
=
she brought the soul of 2ne1 on the stage.
Here is the QUEEN~!!!!!
=
Imagine having this queen cover your song.... I would die right then and there
=
Global Blackjacks were like “English sub pls.” 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
=
I wont stop wishing for 2ne1 reunion.. I know it'll happen soon!!!
=
이거 보면서 노래바꿔서 할때 다들 편곡해서 한다길래
"아.. 겁나 이상해지겠네" 했는데 다들 편곡을 되게 잘해놨음.. 엄청 바뀌지도 않고 신스만 조금 바꿔서 자기 스타일로 바꿔놔서 좋았음 ㅎㅎㅎ
=
This suits Park Bom because  HER and 2NE1 are the reason why gg like G-IDLE exists.
=
하위 받고 이 잔뜩 갈고 온 거 보인다...ㅜㅜ
=
아무리 욕하든 뭐 어쩌든 조회수로 실력 보여주는듯 봄언니 꽃길만 걸어요
=
아이들:저리가
박봄:꺼져
=
When your fav is singing the song you composed. Gosh, can't even imagine how Soyeon is feeling.
=
씨엘이 같이 해주면 좋았을탠대
=
2NE1 때부터 느낀거지만 음색은 정말 퀸!!! 아무도 커버못하는 독보적인 듯함.  댓글에 있는 것처럼 커버곡 잘 할까 걱정했는데 이번엔 정말 멋졌음.  박봄 엄청 응원합니다!!
=
첫 등장부터 위엄 있고 진짜 멋있었음 ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 방송에서 계속 봄이 목소리를 들을 수 있다는것도 좋았는데 이번에 이런 퍼포먼스까지 준비해서 무대 보니까 투애니원 시절도 생각나고 넘 멋있었다.....>_<
=
??....뭔데....??  아이들꺼 보고 와씨 소름 두바구니네 했는데 이건 뭐... 클래스라는 말로 밖엔 설명이 안되는 급이네
=
얼마나 외로웠을까 자기 멤버들 너무 보고싶겠지..?
=
Really. Seriously. Who thinks it's a good idea to let Bom cover their own song. She owns the song  like champion. Now I already forgot the original song
=
아악 시발ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 언니 그냥 다 해먹으세여 제발 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 너무 아름다웓 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜ 마지막에 투애니원 시그니처 너무 쓸쓸한 것 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠ 진짜 이번에도 하위권이면 가슴 찢어져 ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 언니 응원해요 치타님도 짱이얃 흑흑
=
이건 인간적으로 원곡자한테 사과해야하는 수준이다,.. 혼자 씹어 먹네
=
와 갑자기 노래가 개 고급스러워진다 아이돌노래가 아닌거같애
=
I might've cried just a little
=
miss bom making hann trend #1 in melon!!
=
Im glad she sounded much much better than last week..
=
이게어케 러블리즈보다 낮냐
=
