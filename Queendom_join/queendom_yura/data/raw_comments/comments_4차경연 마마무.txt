if you don't like mamamoo raise your standards

“they won because of popularity,”

how did they get popular? of course with the amount of talent they have, sweethearts, not lip syncing.
=
I can't even tell who's the main vocal, gosh the vocals
=
Them: Mamamoo don't deserve the win--
Moomoos: Being too busy with all the ratatata tatata tatatata tatata tatata uri kyeolguk dashi mannal unmyeongieotji
=
Mamamoo just forgot about the competition, they did everything for their fans, they performed every song like it was their concert. People enjoyed their performances and that's the only thing they wanted. They were like, "Scrue the competition, we love our fans more," and they won. 

They deserved it:)
=
“They won because they’re popular”

But like they got popular because of??? Talent love
=
is no one going to talk about moonbyuls visuals in this.
=
솔직히 이그룹은 방탄만큼 떠도 이상하지 않을듯 실력이 진짜 내가 본 그룹중에 젤 짱이야... 타팬인데도 진짜 대박이다 맘무 입덕위기네
=
They really deserved the win they give off real singers energy
=
I can’t believe that Hwasa is so strong in this perfomance. Thats why she is a threat.
=
People who didn't think Mamamoo would win Queendom have obviously not seen Immortal Song
=
Lately in the community there has been a rise in the amount of toxic fans who try to throw disrespect on the names of established artists that have numbers in charts and results to back up their popularity. While at first it may not seem like Mamamoo is that big in comparison to other mainstream girl group idols because they have more yt views than we do, views at the end of the day isn't what will win awards and gain respect in the industry. Gogobebe already broke a lot of Mamamoo and other music records and they will continue to rise- Moo Moo's fanbase grows bigger and bigger every year and Mamamoo only gets better. It's also sad because back in the day no matter what, there was always an attitude in the kpop community that whether you stan them or not, you need to have respect to older established artists. That attitude unfortunately has seemed to stop for artists who came out around the time of Mamamoo, because there are always fans of groups who have existed for a minute who go around disrespecting their legacy like they haven't worked forever for what they have. I believe girl groups like BP, Gidle, etc will make their own amazing marks on music. They have been killing the scene as newer groups up until now. However, they are still new and are growing. A portion of their fans need to stop letting views and online popularity go to their heads and be respectful towards older established artists instead of dragging them like they haven't worked for years to build the legacy they have now.
=
Tonight I dreamed they had a MV for Destiny.  Hip is a masterpiece but I can't understand that they haven't promoted with Destiny since Queendom :(
=
trying to discredit their win by saying they are popular is pointless, how do you think they got popular? certainly not for their lipsyncing skills
=
난 문별 랩이 왜 너무 설레지..미치겠다 언니..
=
Hopefully they can perform Destiny again in the rest award ceremonies of this year.
=
무대의 화려함을 줄이고 분위기로 압도 해버렸넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이쯤되니 회사가 일을 안 했다니 보단  의도한 거 같은뎈ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 오로지 마마무 넷만 볼 수 있게 한 것 같음 백댄서들 다 검은색이고 넷만 흰색이니 실제로 봤을 때는 넷만 보였을 거 아녘ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아 진짜 쩐다 마마무ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
얘넨 오히려 라이브가 편하지 데뷔 초부터 라이브 했는데... 립싱크 하면 오히려 불편하고 어색할 따름... 립싱크 하라는데 갑자기 라이브 할 걸...
=
So they won the show with just a B-side track of their upcoming album? PERFORMANCE QUEENS
=
이분들은 항상 드는 생각이 솔로에이스들 네명모아서 프로젝트 그룹 만들었는데 레전드인느낌 이런 사람들이 네명모여있는게 정식그룹이라는건 믿을 수 없어 어떻게 하나하나 다 완벽해
=
마마무 너무 좋다 솔라에서 끝나는줄알았는데  반전 ㅋ 휘인이 앤딩 마무리를 해주네 캬 ~~
=
y'all complaining because mamamoo won is because of they're popular. where did they got their popularity? *from their talent dear*
=
Is no one gonna talk about how their new hairstyles suit them so much especially wheein and moonbyul
=
Mamamoo: *Autotune who? Never heard of her.*
=
이곡은 문별랩파가 정말...
무대 다잡아먹는 개사기 보컬캐 3명안에 문별이 어떻게 랩하나로 같이 쓸어먹을 수 있는지 알게해줌
=
ok for real their stage presence is UNMATCHED. they just exude confidence and power.... and DAMN THOSE VOCALS
=
no one:
absolutely no one:
moonbyul: kill us with that new hair and intense gaze
=
the only thing i hate about mamamoo's music is that it ends
=
난 증말 화사가 우리나라 사람이라서 너무 감사하다 
이런 음색으로 한국어 노래를 들을 수 있다니
=
얘넨 그저 우리나라 가수라는 것만으로도 자랑스럽다
=
I lost interest in Kpop 8 years ago. First group in 8 years to catch my attention
=
마마무 노래 들으면서
랩 부분은 그냥 오... 이러고 넘긴 적 많았는데 이 노래 진짜
문별 랩 너무 잘 어울린다
=
When people talk about MAMAMOO winning cause they are popular. You could say that, but in case you didn't know MAMAMOO started from the bottom. They once performed with only a few people and most of them were close friends and family of Mamamoo. So, yes maybe u could say that, but that POPULARITY your talking about is fairly gained by MAMAMOO themselves it didn't happened just in one clicked. They worked hard as hell and show people what they are capable even if they weren't the "idol image" people are used to. Furthermore, their fans, us moomoos especially kmoomoos. WOrk hard ass fuck. We promote hard, we vote hard and we show how much we love MAMAMOO even if we still aren't as big of a fandom as once, blinks or armys, we still manage to help promote our girls, like I even created a Instagram Mamamoo fan acc to support them. So rather than spreading hate, I am kindly asking you to SHOW AND SUPPORT YOUR FAV AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. CAUSE YOU SPREADING HATE DOESN'T HELP THEM WIN. Your wasting your time just hating and hating, when you could have been voting, streaming and supporting your idols hard af.
.
Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR The LIKES and Noticing this comment. Lets spread LOVE. "BLESS LIFE AND CARRY KNOWLEDGE"
=
4:25 앞부분 팬들한테 호응 유도하는 거 보고 역시 라이브크으으요것이 라이브의 맛 이러고 있었는데 이부분부턴 진짜..... 진짜 이건 관객이랑 함께하는 무대 아녀...... 내 기준 최고 하이라이트..... 말주변이 부족해서 설명을 못하겠는데 진짜 여기 듣자마자 깜짝 놀라고 소름 쫙 돋았음...................
=
휘인이 파란머리 보면 볼수록 예쁘네
=
I really respect how they sing live. Their vocal is not a joke. Four of them create a perfect harmonies when they sing.
=
"Set you freeee" Wheein- 2019
=
this is not a song, this is an anthem
=
We deserved a MV, please I want this song popular as this is a masterpiece
=
다른 가수들은 컨셉이라거나 노래 가사에 집중했다면 이쪽은 보컬이랑 노래로 그냥 다 잡아버리네; 음색 오져요
=
Use to play Imagine Dragon’s song to boost myself in the morning... now destiny helps me 😂
=
그냥 모든 면에서 정말 멋지다
=
This isn't even an official comeback song yet it slayed more than that.
=
아ㅏ 다 좋은데 화사의 특유의 표정이 너무 좋음 눈도 지그시 뜨고 입꼬리 딱 내리면서...진짜 빠질 수밖에 없다니깐
=
1위가누구야??하면서 왔는데 노래 개잘부르네..문별 존내 잘생겼다
=
노래가 ㄹㅇ 좋다 진ㅁ자 ㄹㅇ 개띵곡이야 이건
=
여자아이들이1등이왜아니냐는 댓글보고 마마무무대찾아봤는데...와 역대급...ㄹㅇ소른돋음!! 둘다잘했지만!
=
Such a wonderful performance! I was still wondering why this vid haven’t hit 10m views yet...
=
The song is a killer, these girls have a strong voice and they were probably a little too much for that stage.
=
진짜 왜 저리 못잡아 도대체 왜 킬링들을 줌 아웃으로 하는데??., 마마무분들이 원래부터 잘해서 커버가 되긴하지만 저건 아니지;;
=
내 개인적인 생각으론 브아걸 이을 그룹은 마마무밖에 읎으
=
I thought they where speaking a bit of German at the start. When they said “it’s been” I thought that said “Ich bin”. lmao I’m stupid but I can’t unhear it now....
=
진짜 이 네명은 솔로무대같이 4명이 노래부르는거같음
=
I legit cried in Solar's part like I just love them so much. Take care of our girls
=
4명이 실력이 좋으니까 여유롭게무대를장악하고 관객을리드하는 능력은 탁월하다.
=
This is how many times you fell in love with MAMAMOO

=
MAMAMOO is a pure talent, stage presence and that charisma all in one. No one should dare to ask why again or to diss them why they won. TALENT!
=
마마무는 첫 무대부터 파이널까지 기복없이 꾸준히 잘했음... 정말 멋진 그룹
=
시험기간이라서 안보다가 마마무가 1등이래서 응? 아이들 오마걸 아니고? 했는데 노래가 넘사벽이네 할 만 했다 ㅅㅂ
=
i loved gidles song and perf but MMM deserved this win, they are unrivaled in talentry when it comes to girl groups. idgaf about sales, popularity, views all that bs, they won through pure talent and deserves every bit of this
=
choreographer: how many people do you wanna use as chairs?

mamamoo: yes
=
분위기가 거의 콘서트급인데?? 역시 믿듣맘무
=
이 버전으로 또 음악 나왔으면 중간에 호응유도하는거 개짜릿
=
아니 별이 언니 발 올릴때 나 심장 조사졌잖어,,,,
=
진짜 최고다....이번 무대는 문별 랩, 보컬라인 음색, 의상, 분위기, 화사 표정에서 심장폭격 당했다 허ㅜㅜㅠ❤❤❤
=
Their voices are their biggest weapons to conquer everything.
=
International moo moos waiting for world tour be like : i can wait forever 🎶🎶
=
Did I just witness a masterpiece?!?! Good Lord, this performance is flawless!
=
화사는 표현력이 정말 뛰어난것같다..도입부에 등장해서 모자 벗으며 하늘볼때 진짜 모래 많은 더운 서부에 쨍쨍한 햇빛보는것같이 느껴졌음..00:30
그리고 3:21 이때는 어?진짜우나? 이런 생각이 들정도로.. 암튼 최고
=
I just realized that in all Mamamoo live performances, they never had a grand stage as other groups had. I can only think of a piano, a pole, a chair and backup dancers?80% relies on their vocals and stage presence alone. And yet, they still managed to have one of (if not the) most energetic and impactful performances of any live shows.
TRUE QUEENS....
=
DONT LOOK AT WHEEIN’S EYES. IT’S A GRAVE MISTAKE. I’M UNDER HER SPELL NOW
=
Wheein's wholeass look left me speechless. Her best one yet.
=
people who comment that mamamoo don't deserve the win are probably tone deaf. srsly, if the standards for this contest is all about stage presence and elaborate stages, then i'd rather watch the victoria secret fashion show. please, mamamoo won this because of pure talent  that's why they are called "singers".
=
2:41 is my favvvv : DESTINY MAKES ME CRY, DESTINY MAKES ME SMILE
=
Why is Moonbyul such a girl crush
i cant
=
Any 🇲🇾 moomoo whos happy Mamamoo won😁 😏 🙋‍♀️
=
their stage presence just amazing making ma forehead cant chill
=
각자 캐파가..장난 없네 그냥 그루브라는게 이런건가 ..싶어요
=
Finally, the most talented ones win
=
아이들이 1등이ㅡ아니라고? 하고 맘무를 버니.. 무대 퀄리티보니깐 답 나오네여..맘무 무대가 비어보여도 장악력 장난 아니네...
=
1st perf: Introduction song
2nd perf: Solo stages
3rd perf: Song for Moomoos
4th perf: Ending song

Lol Queendom is not a competition for Mamamoo. They just joined to have a looooong concert. 🤩
=
진짜 개소름돋네 무대하나로 사람 유혹시키는게 가능한가 와 ..
=
난 이 무대를 볼 운명이였지.
=
i mean they even connected with the audiences too
=
Only mamamoo will engage with the audience in a competition XDD queens will always be queens
=
안무 빡세도 핸드마이크 쓰는거 ㄹㅇ 개뽄새남
=
문별 2:42 초 랩 목소리 왤케 좋지 ㅠㅠ 계속 생각나서 돌려보는중 🥱❤️
=
Who’s addicted to Wheein’s “set you free” 🙋🏼‍♀️
=
아니 마마무에게서 투애니원이 보일줄이야
=
Mamamoo always makes sure that the audience is having fun,
=
At first i don't know why my daughter is so addicted to this group they're just a group of singers now i see why she like this group so much they have great vocal
=
They can sing. That's why mamamoo os different than all competitors
=
4:10초쯤인가 혜진이 언니 웃는거 왜어렇게 좋을까여
I like 4:10 HWASA's smile
=
알비덥 돈좀쓰자... 이 무대에 돈들인거 안무팀밖에 없잖아ㅋㅎ
=
Mamamoo only need microphones as their props... and hyejin’s hat
=
they win because they have a talent
=
팬덤빨 이러는 사람들 있는데 매력이 있으니까 팬덤이 많지. 뭘그리 꼽냐. 계속 어떤 댓글에서 "얘네가 왜 1위함 ○○이 1위 할만한데 ㄹㅇ" 이러는 거 있던데 그냥 인정하세요. 이미 투표는 끝났고 퀸덤도 끝났어요.
=
I hope they perform this at least t one award shows.
=
this is officially the coolest shit this 2019
=
I’m sure this would be such a memorable ending performance that everyone can enjoy. Put the competition aside, let’s just have fun and enjoy a wonderful performance!
=
DESTINY is just a b-side song from their 2nd full album and look what they have achieved with it. Cant wait for their title song HIP next week!🤗
=
2:10
Mamamoo : Uri gyeolgok dashi manna unmyeongiosshi

Me : *uridkgjsnffjxsjfkfkdjffdjfkfyosshi*
=
Their love to us moo moo make them win.. They always mention our moo moo instead of our fan.. And never forget to mention moo moo in their speech..

My fav word:
"Uri moo moo deul"
=
3:55 this what a performance is 
THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE GREAT AND MEMORABLE PERFORMANCE.
They always involve the audience in their performances that why everyone remembers and loves them.
Audiences Hype them up and they do the same.
=
Now I know why they won. This was the last video I watched. Their artistry, power, and charisma is off the roof. They are not just idols, they're performers. It doesn't need any extravagant background, their voices makes the stage. They are so powerful internally, you can see it in their eyes. They are here to win. They deserved it. :)
=
I really admires singers who can dance while holding mics cause I know it’s hard holding something in the hand while dancing is just not natural
=
I swear to god they’re the best at engaging with the audience this is one of the reason why i love them soo much🥰😤
=
They don't eat Cd. 
They eat the entire studios. 

Even their Live perf sounds better than studio version.

REAL QUEEN PERIOD.
=
oh no Solar 3:01 got scared for a second there
=
Some people will say Mamamoo won because they have a big fandom. Some will say they won because Mnet messed up with the votes. But anyone who gives this performance an unbiased look can see it's absolutely awesome. The final round had many great (really great) performances, it's not like Mamamoo was way above all the others, but they had a full package (sass, choreo, vocals and the featuring of the audience), so if they won, it's because they definitely deserved it.

EDIT. Wow. Didn't realize this comment was going to bring all this. To all the moomoos, just stop paying attention to the haters. They don't deserve it, and it's not like you're going to change anyone's mind. It's like talking to a wall, and it brings a whole bunch of negativity. Let's just focus on the positive, that is, Mamamoo's win, and the talent and hard work we KNOW they put forward. To those who say Mamamoo robbed 1st place and didn't deserve it, I'm sorry your faves have such immature, disrespectul fans, but it's not my mission in life to fix people. Go your own way.
=
Quuen Hwasa everyone✨
=
3:12
I see nobody talking about solar's deep voice, holy crap, that hidden talent is so underrated
=
갠취로 무대까지 보고나서는 라이언이 너무 넘사로 좋았지만 음원만 들었을 때는 이 곡이 제일 좋았기 때문에 무대연출이 아쉬웠다. 지금도 가끔 음원으로 듣기도 하고, 여전히 좋은노래 마음을 울리는 보컬들
=
I always get watery eyes while watching their live performances, they're just so powerful :D
=
Haters or unreasonable people: MMM can't dance
Yes they can and they're really good at it. They know what kind of dance suit their song best so they can bring out LIVE singing without getting out of breath while dancing. I love their freedom on stage, how they interact with fans while singing.
EDIT: THEY'RE NOT USING HAND MIC FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THEIR COMEBACK "HIP" AND STILL HAVE STABLE VOCALS, TAKE THAT HATERS!!
=
at 4:08 you can see's hwasa's gorgeous smile; you can tell that she's actually enjoying the stage so much
=
I was battling with my brain for so long and didn't watch the final performance until now of Mamamoo and G-Idle when I found out that why didn't G-idle win? Like why? But after watching this performance, if I were part of the judging too, I love G-idle I do, they're my bias but, Mamamoo, YOU ARE THE QUEEN. I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE ANYMORE.


Ps. Don't use the "they are famous" line for their win, well, gotta ask yourself why they're famous in the first place, and try to rewatch EVERY final performances of all contestants, you need light and Mamamoo wore white for ya'll to see.
=
Always give me goosebumps everytime I watch
=
i have goosebumps EVERY time i listen to this

real vocal queens 👏👏
=
OMG YOU GUYS SO COOL, I'M CRYING RN, SORRY FOR LATE EONNIES CUZ I HAVE EXAM 1 WEEK AGO😭 NO MATTER WHAT I ALWAYS LOVE YOU ARE AND CONGRATULATIONS FOR WINNING THE COMPETITION!!! LUVLUV😭🖤✨
=
THE VOCALS DAMN!!  STAN TALENT STAN MAMAMOO!!!
=
Bruh Mamamoo made it their own concert
=
I think the one thing that I truly love and appreciate about Mamamoo is their attitude. You can see the dedication they have for their artistry and music as well as their fans who are there for the same thing. Their vocals are always on point, they're great dancers and their stage presence is always top notch. Not a single one of them is lacking. On top of that instead of doing the weak one song come back Mamamoo comes back with an album. It is truly satisfying as a fan to be able to listen to more than one or two songs. It is always disappointing having to wait so long for another comeback/song with other groups. It is very easy to lose interest in a group that way. Mamamoo should be an example to others of what will work long term. With the way that they are doing things I can see them remaining and striving in the industry for a very long time.
=
They are singers. Performer. Dancing is just for them to round the whole thing up. 
I hope they perform this on MAMA. This song is made to be performed on a big stage with a crowd singing along.

EDIT: hello ladies and gents. thanks for the likes. i'm taking this as 1900+ people agree with me. cool.
i just watched everyone else's performance and i would like to add something:
I'm staying by what i said. i guess the only one from the other groups who could have compete with mamamoo was g-idle. they had a great set design and theme and the main point of the song was very fitting for the show. they also had some good vocals moment here and there.
however, even now after watching the others, i'm not surprised mamamoo won. 
if you compare the other groups and these two, the others were (noticeable) weaker. and i'm not talking specifically about vocals or dance or whatever, i'm talking about their performance as a whole.
g-idle did a great show. the dancers, the thrones. 
mamamoo just had their dancers and incorporated the audience. no extra props. a little bit of background changes on the screen behind them. and well the camera but i don't it did a lot for the performance. 
they did less show off and just performed as they usually do. 
queens comeback is nov 14th.
=
Mamamoo deserves a world tour.
=
Mamamoo is a proof that idols don't need a super duper very fantastic stage with a lot of lighting and stories and acting to have a good stage. They are the proof that talent doesn't choose good or bad stages. They were so far the only group that made it the simplest but the most special.
=
So no one's gonna talk about Yeba almost tripping at 3:02 then bumping into Byulie ?
We stan talented queens, but they're dorks to the very end...
=
I listen to this at least five times a day 😅
=
Destiny makes me cry.
Destiny makes me smile.

-Mamamoo, Oct 2019.
=
No one:
MoonByul: DEZ TINI MAKE‘S ME CRY
=
THEIR VOICES THEIR HARMONIES I AM ACTUALLY SHAKING
=
I LOOOOOVE THIS SONG 🥺😍😍
=
The last “ratata” tempo reminds me of Infinite’s Dilemma...
=
mOONBYUL, STOP FLIRTING WITH THE CAMERAS
=
Every Mamamoo's performance is like a world tour concert! The energy is overwhelming!
=
Whatever anyone says, Mamamoo makes me sooooo proud. I’ve never felt this much connection to a group and I’ve been a fan of Kpop since like 2008. MOOMOO FA LIFE 😩🙌🏽
=
문별파트 중독성 오지네
=
I'll be honest here. I've watched every single performance and they're ALL unbeatable. They're all so unique and incredible, I really cannot pick a single one as the best. I keep coming back to all of these vids and the most important thing I've realised is that WE are the winners. We got to see the full potential of all these QUEENS. They're all the best.
That being said, I hope there are no fanwars for the results. MNet is a snake so don't let them set you off. Show love.💕
=
Mamamoo won? Omg yes! Now I don't have to choose either Park Bom or Mamamoo.
=
I fall in love with moonbyul
=
QUEENS MAMAMOO 💜
=
Did anyone noticed 3:04 solar tripped over herself?😂
Anyways,mamamoo is the best
=
That ending pose is the  most beautiful i've ever seen for a while
=
You know how great of a group they are when this MASTERPIECE song is just their B Side track! WOAH. 💯
Their comeback's gonna be fire! 🔥
=
I hope their perform this song at MAMA along with HIP
=
A lot of people are still doubtful about MMMs win in queendom. Saying they won due to popularity and seniority. It's just disappointing that MMMs hardwork was trashed by antis who are never satisfied.
I know everyone who participated in queendom deserved to win. They're all winners. But please don't comment in this video and in other queendom performance videos that MMM did not deserve to win. It's just disrescting their hard work in perfecting their craft.

Anyways, i watched queendom because of MMM then ended up being a fan of the 5 other participants.
#GoQueendom #GGlove
=
이번 무대 정말 레전드다!! 마마무 1위 축하하고 너무 고생많았어요!!
=
Who's waiting for this performance for damn whole week!!!!.. who's with me!!! vote
=
I just came back online after being grounded... Kill me I was literally begging my parents to let me watch this. Let this be a lesson, this is what you get for failing your classes.
=
I hope Mamamoo sing this song at MAMA 🥺
=
@3:42 Other girl Groups fell in love
=
I've been hearing ratatata tatata in my head for about 2 weeks now and I'm actually not mad about it
=
My friend is a huge mamamoo fan, and I can understand why.  They don’t follow  music trends as much as other artist..it does help that they can write..and because of that, their songs stand out.
=
Fuckingggg QUEENS LIKE THEIR EVERY EFFING STAGE IS LIKE THEIR OWN DAMN CONCERT I LOVE THESE LADIES SO MUCH THEY SLAY NO QUESTION ASKED
=
1:47 chii~ Omg, just close your eyes and listen to this heavenly beautiful voice
=
Can we all take time to apperactie how damn good Moonbyul looked and sounded? She snapped with visuals
=
I like mamamoo soo much they're really talented everytime they performed. They're having fun.... I'm don't why they're not that popular.... They're really talented groups🤔😔😔😍😍😍
=
mamamoo deserved to win PERIOD. this performance just solidified it, it was a whole other level and the interactions with the audience made it so different
=
No lip syncing for my skilled queens.
=
i am crying so hard, I cant love them this much, my heart will explote;;
=
휘인 set you free 에서 정신을 못 차리겠다 음색..
=
MMM vocals are EVERYTHING! Literally out here slaying everybody. I love hearing raw vocals like theirs...can't wait for their CB.
=
Mamamoo tore the stage even without heavy breakdance. Their vocals and their stage presence is enough to set Queendom on fire. I like how Mamamoo never treat Queendom stage as a battle against another girl group instead when it's their turn to perform, they treat it as if its their concert stage and interacting with audience, hyping them up. They are not idols anymore but a true artists.
=
1:35 Why does Moonbyul's voice give me goosebumps...
=
진심 레전드무대임..ㅜ 입덕한결정타무댛ㅎ
=
came back here again because they didn't perform it on MAMA
=
While everyone in the comment is so serious let me give you this to brighten up your day 3:01 look at how cute solar is
=
Mamamoo didn't do anything fancy. No over the top costume or props, just a simple stage and only interacted with the audience but still managed to SLAY the stage. Such queens! Other contestants were AMAZING but I always come back to this performance. We really are the real winners. Started watching Queendom for Mamamoo but stayed for all groups. Congratulations to all the contestants!
=
4:09 Hyejin's smile tho😍😍💖💖
=
3:01 sola highlight
=
Why is this song so good!!
=
Ahhh reminds me of how good music can be. 

Many people like KPOP for their cute idols, but for Mamamoo, people love them for their stable, elegant, and soothing voices.    Honestly, a top tier KPOP girlgroup IMO
=
Mamamoo is the only group who interacts amd hypes the crowd like this 💞 i love how they include the crowds energy in order to make the performance more powerful🔥
=
I just noticed that Solar trips around 3:00-3:05 and tries not to laugh about it. And I've seen this a bunch of times
=
3:03 be careful,solar😨
=
Mamamoo giving me a goosebumps everytime they sings. Their vocals is really powerful! STAN TALENTS!
=
3:01 Solar being cutie clumsy again ❣ still nailed it.  MAMAMOO for the Win ❤
=
Omg they’re dressed like cowgirls, I volunteer to be their horse
=
LAS MEJORESSSSS <3
=
Now that HIP and the concept has been cleared to me i see how this Destiny n story puts together .
No matter which ever reality they were in they always met we witnessed some in the mv . but like forreal 👌👌👌 
Side track n main track are kinddddaa connected if u think about it from diff angle..
=
Bro I feel so proud being a moomoo ❤️
=
그리고 솔라 선배님 정말 마마무의 메인보컬로서 노래 너무 파워풀하게 잘해줬고 팀의 중심을 잘 이끌어주셔서 너무 감사합니다 앞으로 마마무의 리더로서 더 열심히 해주세요 솔라 선배님 화이팅!!! 할 수 있습니다!!!

Mnet: How many props do you want on stage?


Mamamoo: How about people?
=
I'm in love with this song!
=
This song deserved MV and must be perform in big stage!
=
love the message of the song, the ending pose :') all they need is each other, nothing else
=
This performance shook my whole existence. Mamamoo doesn't need to prove anything to anyone. They. Deserve. Their. Win. CONGRATS QUEENS!
=
MAMAMOO got nothing when they started their career. NOTHING AT ALL. Their company even borrowed money just for them to debut. All the things that they have now are the result of their hardwork. Your idols are very lucky to be in a large company but do you think they would survive and would have successful debuts if they weren't? I don't think so. Things will not be the same. (Don't get this statement wrong)

Actually, MAMAMOO deserves more than this but still they are very grateful because they were given oppurtunities like this where in fact, they don't even need to prove themselves.

If you're thirsty for your idols to win, then WORK HARD instead of dragging others down. It's not our fault if we do our best as a fandom because we will do whatever it takes for MAMAMOO to get what they really deserve.

Yes, they might not be able to invest as much as others on their final stage but their vocal ability, stage presence, uniqueness, and connection to the audience is already enough. They don't need thrones, props and everything, they only need their voices, charisma, talent and their audience to make a remarkable performance.

Look at 3:55, they are performing WITH the audience.

They don't try to impress, they express their gratitude to the audience. 

That's how idols, or should I say ARTISTS should be. They are free to express themselves and don't follow anyone's standard.

Edit: This comment is not made to start a fanwar. Yes, it is a little provocative but please understand that I just want to defend my girls. All groups are deserving and for me, all of them won because they were able to show their true colors. Lets just respect each other's opinion and understand that we have our own preferences. 

MooMoos, lets keep the peace in our radish field! Lovelots 💓
=
I mean I like Lion but this performance is much more about music. The vocals are perfect. The win was deserved
=
They won because they deserve it. Deal with it.
=
Ewwww



They only won because of their

 amazing talent, angelic voices and crazy overall perfromance
=
iM LOSING MY MIND OHMYGLOB

EVERY. DANG. TIME. MAMAMOO. PERFORMS. ON. THIS. SHOW. TALK A BOUT A BIAS GROUP
=
I don't know why ... i love mamamoo 💜💜💜💜 ohh her voice 💋
=
마마무는 진짜 외국 가수 같아. 한국어로 이런 스타일의 노랠 들을 수 있다는게 너무 신기해 진짜..ㄷㄷ
=
This is what we called a masterpiece. Stan talent, stan Mamamoo <3
=
they make every performance like a fkin concert and i wnt to go one huhuhuhu
=
아 마마무 콘서트는 진짜 가야겠다
=
마마무 뭔말필....
빌보드가면 씹고 찢고 끝장일거 같은데
이리 같은언어 같은나라 마마무 무대보고 노래들을수있음에 감사해요ㅠㅠ♡♡♡♡
=
Wish my name was Destiny, just to hear them say it ... <3
=
They always like to get the crowd into it
=
I can't stop listening to the song!! These vocals are addictive!! I stan the right group!!
=
Imagine having an mv for this song 🔥
=
Hwasa's stank face (4:30) and Moonbyul's top lip lift (3:31) gets me every time (their signature habits). This song is a bop and the performance was great.
=
아이들 팬이긴 했지만 마마무도 넘사벽이네;; 1위할만 하네! 마마무 화이팅!
=
마마무가 현장감이 가장 중요한 경연에 강한 이유는 기본적으로 탄탄한 라이브를 바탕으로 퍼포먼스를 꾸미기 때문일터 관객들과 호흡하는 부분에서 소름 돋았어...
=
1:48 Solar's voice sounds like Taeyeon's omg
=
3:30 moonbyulll my heart 😍😍😍😍
=
seems like no one noticed that solar slipped at 3:00
she handle it professionally !! we stan !!!
=
Other people can’t see how talented Mamamoo is. There voices is not joke. I hope you will be able to identify what is talent. 😒
=
"Destiny makes me cry, 
Destiny makes me smile"

— MAMAMOO 2k19
=
퀸덤 잘 안보고, 짤보다 아이들 라이언이 너무 좋은 거야. 근데 1등이 아니래. 왜징, 하고 봤는뎅... 괜히 믿듣이 아뉨...  이니 어케 저릫게 칼박자 안무+무대 매너에 노래도 완벽해? 난 큰서트 보는 줄 알았쟈너...
=
Mamamoo showed us that a GOOD performance doesn’t need many tricks, dancers, fancy motions or effects. You just need to touch people’s hearts with your raw vocals and unique charisma! Mamamoo easily has the besttt teamwork in owning the stage TOGETHER and individually still shining without overpowering the other members. THAT my friends, is GOD TIER. 

Other fans might be sad cos their groups didn’t win but I think that’s not the point. To Mamamoo, it was never about the competition but to always show a better side of themselves and to deliver the best and most authentic performances for fans. With that mindset, to me, Mamamoo has already won from the start.
=
Moonbyul <3
=
as expected from mamamoo. Mamamoo will be remembered as queendom.
=
와 본인들 역량이 뛰어나니까 곡 자체를 확 끌어올려버리네. 늘 그렇지만 이번엔 진짜 곡 자체가 가지고 있는 임팩트 이상을 내는 것 같음 괜히 마마무 마마무 하는 게 아니네 레알 멋있음
=
It's been 84 years and some people still mad that MAMAMOO WON QUEENDOM.
😄
=
I hope they will perform this at MAMA 2019. It's gonna be LIT 😍😍😍
=
when moon star ain't with them on stage, I feel empty.
=
04:30 - 04:32 Hwasabi feeling herself , yasss gurl , you're fire !!!
=
아이들무대도 신박해서 좋았지만 마마무 무대장치나 많은댄서안무 없이 넷이서 무대공백채우는건 인정한다.
=
This has been my jam since I heard it!! God Mamamoo can bring it! And Moon Byul is stealing stealing my heart!
=
3:02 solar almost trip 😥
=
Wheein 😍😍😍
=
I AM HERE AND I WILL COME BACK WHEN MAMAMOO DOMINATES THIS WORLD. YES!
=
핀마이크 안차고 리얼 라이브 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 격이 다르다는걸 보여주네
=
Queens of K-pop👑
=
I will literally never shut up about this
=
No wonder they are winning queendom. Its on another level. And for sure they did not win just because they are popular. They prove their worthy. Maybe i'll become a moomoo.
=
Oooo, Moonbuyl, you stole my heart
=
I think this is my favourite song from reality in black but honestly, I LOVE ALL OF THEM!! <3
=
Is it only me feel like ' i can wait forever' line is meant to be for hye jin voice 😍
=
This is going to be the best MMM era yet. Perfect song (seriously), perfect choreo, perfect styling, perfect hair. I cannot describe how much I want my hair to look like that.
=
2:22 Hwasa's face XD
=
앨범 타이틀로 나와야할 노래를 퀸덤 수록곡으로 쓰다니 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I always love moonbyuls raps. They're actually so good
=
Each been a......
Their accent is so cute but still love them ♥
=
I love the build up of power from hwasa at 4:32
=
Wheein voice everything
=
다른팀들이 애써서 의외의 컨셉, 새로운 시도를 보여줄려고 하는데
마마무는 그냥 '우리가 마마무다' 느낌만으로 탑클라스 인증하고 가는듯
=
moonbyul looks so intense and cool!!!
=
I love how everyone shines. Love this performance

This song fits Queendom xD
=
OMG lyric and dance 2:12 so cool
=
All i see is Mamamoo concert 👏🏻 YESS they deserve to win 🔥
=
Whoever picked that lipstick for Hwasa needs a raise
=
KPop song of the year. Holy shizbiscuits. This is powerful talent right there.


<3, a faithful ARMY who also stans some mighty Queens.
=
수십번을 보러와도 매번 놀라고 갑니다,, 진짜 그냥 완벽 그 자체...
=
the way wheein pronounces "thin" is doing things to me .
=
It's like a James Bond theme
=
아니 이번에 문별 랩 너무 잘한듯 ,,
문별 맨날 좀 래퍼보다 보컬 아닌가 생각햇는데
오ㅏ 아니 이번에 노래 너무 괜찮고 랩 레전드다
=
I also thought "LION" won but WOW!!! Mamamoo really did a great performance tho, victory is well served. 👏👏👏
=
es que, mamamoo está a otro nivel.
=
''set you free~'' 
OMG goosebump everywhere
=
when hwasa was like 👉🏽👉🏽👉🏽 🔥
=
I am not a mamamoo’s fan but I like the performance they did so much. I saw ppl saying that they win bc they have strong fans base or what but to be honest I would vote for mamamoo too if I could vote. I mean they are so unique and talented, their performances are really nice 👍 okie if they win bc of they have strong fans base thn so what? Who would like them and vote for them if they are not good
=
I'm so proud of myself for being a mamamoo enthusiast
=
3:03 solar😂
=
im here everyday since 31st of Oct, i love their live performance  doesnt seem like one of them is more or less the spotlight than the others.
Yet im still confused da da da da da da ra da ra da. 🤣
=
3:02 oh solar 😅
=
So they created this song just for Queendom?! WOW
=
They make me feel like I am a part of this performance.
I sing along with them, dance along with them.
And their voices, for me, are enough to win.
=
Someone saw Solar almost falling 3:01 ??? Omg, second time Solar. If I was you nevermore I would use high heels kkkkkkkkk
=
I'M SO PROUD OF THEM 😭😭😭😭
=
im addicted to this song, love love love the way they performed it. small details like hwasa's actions to some western film sound effects in the intro. in love with the attitude they carried for this stage performance, the kind of chest-held-high and resolutely self-assured attitude. i was captivated by wheein's and solar's expressions and delivery, i find solar exceptionally in-character, her sweeping gesture at 4:40 is PERFECT, i can keep replaying it!!! also kudos to the dancers who executed their last "being flung away" move in sync and enhancing the visual effect of the choreo. ugghhhh, i love this performance.
=
MAMAMOO knows how to connect to their audience and hype the people up that's why all of their performances are dope! 👏
=
They're ARTISTS dear, so what could you expect from these queens? They delivered top class performances And LIVE. Stan mamamoo, they're coming back tomorrow!
=
I can’t take my eyes off them
=
this song is SO GOOD! i really want ONEUS to cover it haha.
it'd be epic.
=
Mamamoo just deserve the first placeee
=
Who’s here again for the 100thousand time after they announced their comeback
=
I love mamamoo, all of them are very talented!!!
=
Please stream their new song "HIP"❤️❤️
=
Keeps streaming everyday on my way home from work, when I wash my dishes, even when taking a shower 😂 so perrrrrfectttttt!
=
What I love about Mamamoo? SIMPLICITY. 
Authentic, raw and real. That should be the norm of Kpop and not always trying so hard to come up with crazy, impressive stuff to impress audiences.
=
Question: Who's doing it like them?
Answer: Absolutely no one.

QUEENS.
=
Such a beautiful song ❤️
=
I literally have a goosebumps😲
=
3:00 there is always a time when solar just fell on this show 😂 but they are just amazing anyway ! 😍
=
4 queens just  mesmerizing ❤❤❤❤❤
=
"Destiny makes me cry, destiny makes me smile" - for me, the entire 5 years with Mamamoo were Mamamoo's era! The ultimate queens. Legendary GG of K-pop! 💕
=
i know from the beginning that they r going to win
=
A masterpiece ❤️
=
mamamoo out there saving the whole kpop girl groups industry once again
=
I stan other groups along with mamamoo so I was very honest in all the perfromance and watching this people should realize they deserve the win, non of the group had such strong vocals like mamamoo, this was lowkey like a concert and they were able to hype up the audience . they music the chorus went really well. Other groups did great too but honestly dont bash them for winning.
=
Wheein is a bless. Hair color is on point, clothes is on point, the dimple is on point.... yes, you read it right....the dimple. ☺️
=
They were so amazing it took me like 20 watches to even realize Solar tripped 😂
=
AMO DEMAIS, DEUSAS MARAVILHOSAS
=
I come back every day to listen to my vocal queens and cleanse my ears 💕
=
I am in love with this song and in mamamoo in general.
=
문별 인생곡인듯
휘인 리듬감 쫀득하다 
화사 노래 분위기 잘잡아주고
솔라는 라따따~ 개 잘살림
=
I love their outfit!
=
I would have loved to see Dreamcather in quuendom 🥰
=
3:01 
name one Queendom performance where Solar didn't trip xD
=
This reminds me of when Coldplay played for superbowl halftime, and Beyoncé and Bruno stole the show. They are real talented
=
WORLD TOUR 
WORLD TOUR
WORLD TOUR
FOR
QUEEN OF QUEENS👑
=
내가 진짜 이 영상 보고나서 마마무 입덕했다
=
still gives me goosebumps! excited for MAMAMOO's comeback
=
mamamoo is one of the few groups now a days that race the standards of how a performance should be. Before it was BigBang, 2ne1 and those 2nd gen artists during the golden era of kpop. Now in this 3rd generation I can see the hope in mamamoo, Yesssss they knew how eat the stage 💯🖤🖤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
=
Excuse me, they slayed so hard?! I'm ratatating all the way!
=
I’ll never get tired of saying that they are the best and the most charismatic female vocal group.
=
진짜 노래가 5분이 되는데 '곡이 벌써 끝났어?'라는생각을 다했다...그만큼 몰입도가 진짜 최상이고.....아 몰라 마마무 사랑해요...진짜
=
이 무대는 진짜 문별이 보석이었음 진짜 별처럼 빛나네
=
The stage so lit XD
=
3:01 Solar at the back. Sorry
=
이번에 문별 휘인 너무 잘생겼다..
=
"Destiny make me cry , Destiny make me smile" . 
Fall in love with this part 🤧😍
R.i.p reply button .
=
Here I am again. I love this performance 😍😍
=
solar almost trip on 3:03 then moonbyul said : 조심
=
When they sing... damn... its literally surreal.
=
No one:

Mamamoo: In the first episode they were sitting like they know they will win and they did. 
What can I say to Queens
=
Im so proud :") 
Been w them since Um Oh Ah Yeah 
😭😭🙆🏻‍♀️💕
=
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW SOLAR TRIP AND ALMOST FALL ON 3:03
I LOVE MAMAMOO THEY ARE ONE OF THE BEST GROUP. THEY DESERVE MORE POPULARITY
=
When they thought its over by solars final blow but then aesthetic formation has been formed by the queens
=
댄서분들이 솔라님을 위에 들고 오시네ㅋㅋ 몰랐는데ㅋㅋ
=
사람들이 퀸덤 마마무 마마무 거리길래 나도 한 번 봐봤더니 보고나니 어느새 나도 마마무 마마무
=
OMG THEIR VOICE ITS SO UNIQUE AND ITS SOOOOOOOO AMAZING WHEN THEY COMBINE IT TOGETHER♥
=
stan talent
=
One of my favourite Moonbyuls rap parts, and the song also highlights the difference in their singing voices nicely.
=
3:01 solar being clumsy😂❤️
=
0:32 감탄하는 와중에 뒤에서 백댄서들 갖고 오는 하얀거 무슨 간지나는 소품인줄 알았는데 솔라가 내리넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Watched 
Mamamoo Destiny - seriously,this is it best song, move on
OhMyGirl Guerilla - ok ok wait what this is definitely best song, click
AOA - Western vibe ok hang on, this is dope best song ever, move to
Lovelyz - another Western vibe, god please help me this is best song, next!
Gidle - ok definitely this is the best song
Bom - ok you know what this is it

I CAN'T JUST PICK ONE.. I'm so freaking tired, always come back to watch every each of the performance..never missed one
=
Im crying, they are everything that I was searching for :')
=
Solar tripped at one point during this performance, I’m just so glad she wasn’t fazed by it ❤️
=
I’m watching it for the millionth time and scrolling through comments and liking everything
=
마마무 우승포인트는 실력도 실력이지만 마지막에 관객과의 소통이였다 마마무가 춤이 격하지 않아서 핸드마이크를 썼다는 댓글을 보고 단다 다른팀들도 다 잘했지만 마마무는 거기다가 관객과의 소통이 들어가서 더 호응을 유발한거다 그니까 마마무 작작 깍아내려라
=
This hits me so bad.
It feels like I'm in Mamamoo concert💕
=
Mamamoo remind me of 2ne1 where..  Strong vocal.  No need auto tune and can communicate with audience not to mention free style
=
MAMAMOO won so: get with the winning team ho 👏👏
=
3:01 look at solar😂😂😂
=
2:24 wowww 😭❤ i love this part
=
진짜 미쳤어 ㅜㅠ
=
3:02 ops solar..
=
The song is really smooth ❤️
=
They really out here being a whole WOMAN group ❤️
=
moonbyul look gorgeus
=
It was HELLA epic, and also, I cried kinda while watching the performance
=
Solar really isnt having luck with shoes lmao
=
마마무는 실력도 실력인데 저 여유가 말도 안됨...
=
OMG! I love the song😍❤️
=
Actually queens of kpop
=
They made themselves LEGENDS!!
=
Love Mamamoo at first epsoide! Their vocals.. oah great! A talent!
=
마마무는 어쩜 관객과 하나되는 무대를 정말 잘하는거같다. 음색도 좋고 음악도 좋고 노래를 잘불러. 그렇다고 퍼포먼스적인 부분에서 밀리는것도 아니라 정말 가수, 싱어라는 말에 걸맞는 그룹이다.
=
I muss Hwasa’s long hair😩😩 it suited her so fricking well!
=
이야 이게 진짜 레전드지 .... 노래 너무 좋아 춤도 너무 좋아 무대도 너무 좋아 최고야 그냥 ㅠ
=
I LOVE THIS SONG AND I LOVE MAMAMOO! ❤️😍🥰🔥🔥🔥
=
Hwasa’s whole look ended me
=
Seeing all of them (Mamamoo) cry from this award, first time again in a long period of time, I felt all the emotions they have to go through just to pave their way in this show. The fact that they didn't have much time to prepare for this stage, due to their VERY tight schedule, attending and performing at award shows here and there, concerts in between, performing in events left and right LITERALLY EVERYDAY, prepping for their comeback this November, Wheein dealing with her anxiety, seriously, they need rest. REALLY. Seeing how much this rewards them, even though they have received even bigger awards from before, truly breaks and flutter my heart at the same time. They have been working they're asses off and still get hate, get bashed,
 One of the most talented groups in SK yet underrated still, gets lesser recognition than more popular girl groups, which I know in my heart they can top off. Let's not lie to ourselves, they are still underrated. But seeing them like this, appreciating everything given to them, and all their fan's works makes my moomoo heart genuinely happy. I'm truly blessed to be a fan of Mamamoo.
=
Overall, I'm so happy all the Queendom contestants bonded and developed friendships so well. That was made me happiest!
=
Hwasa in dark lipstick always hurts my soul 😩
=
this makes me cry
=
타 팬들 댓적을때 자기가 좋아하는 그룹에 이런 댓글 달리면 어떨까 이런 생각좀 하고 달았으면.. 최애그룹이 1등했는데 팬덤빨팬덤빨 하면 기분이 과연 좋을까 ㅋㅋ..
=
진짜 저렇게 보컬스타일 춤스타일 각각 개성강한4명이 매번 다른 장르에 멤버하나하나 잘 녹아드는게 너무 신기함
=
What can't they do...like they are amazing!🔥😍
=
Queens claiming their Queendom.
Period!
=
I wish mamamoo was as known as BTS or BP. They're so amazing and funny
=
So i came again coz this is too damn good
=
I mean why MAMAMOO don’t deserve the win? I don’t really mean that other group is bad, it’s just that I feel like this song is the only song that attracted my attention. I listened to all the song in one go while trying to do other thing, but “Destiny” is the only song that made me stop from doing other thing and sang along. The variety of the concepts totally flowed through, which is quite rare. That’s why usually songs are only stick to one concept. At the start of this song, I thought it’s going to be a quite slow paced and Low pitched song, but every part it broke my expectations and took me to another kind of concept. Even though, MAMAMOO as always, don’t have hard choreography, but their vocals always stood out. Even though I’m not a fan of MAMAMOO, but I do really agree that they should won.
=
The moment moonbyul opened her mouth, I got goosebumps. Damn girl. All you slayed!!!!! I’m crying
=
I always love mamamoo performance, they know how to control EVERYTHING 
including props, backup dancers, music & rhythm 

howevers, true talents of them is their voice and singing rapping skills
=
literally im crying
=
so I'm in LOVE love
=
영화같이 한다더니 진짜 영화같음 초반 화사가 천천히 걸어와서 하늘 보듯이 고개살짝올리고 모자 벗는데 왜 모래바람이 느껴지지...?

3:02 Solar nearly fall in the back
=
3:03 solar what happened??
=
노래도 역대급 퍼포먼스도 역대급 그냥 완벽했습니다. 쉽게 말하면 여태 엠카보다 마마보는 느낌이었어요
=
Masterpiece right here
=
My second fave group. Ofcourse 2ne1 is my number one fave. I get the same vibe when they perform. my QUEENS 💎💎💎💎
=
Las amooooo!!!!! Son súper talentosas!!!! Me.encanta la canción 👑
=
Destiny make me cry
Destiny make me smile
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
=
사실 컨셉이 다 강력해서 비슷할수 있는데 
마마무느 진짜 자연스러워.....경력자의 짬바같은 느낌
=
Queen mamamoo deserve way more recognition
=
The other performances were amazing, really this show was awesome. This one made me cry tho. Totally epic <3
=
The music tho 👌..
The music producer 👍
=
Personally I preferred Lion of this, but this is amazing too (Solar and Wheein's hair though ♥)
=
For me, g-idle’s final performance was the best, but there’s something mamamoo have and I can’t excatly explain it. The song is so good, vocals are on top and they have really good stage domination. I’m glad that mamamoo won the show. By the way, moonbyul is cool! Like I said, g-idle and bom were my favorities but I’m glad that such a talented group won.
=
❗❗❗COME TO MEXICO ❤️🇲🇽❗❗❗
=
3:01 Solar mistake
=
Omg my dear solar trips again xD 3:01- 3:03
=
I can’t say anything just trust Mamamoo and listen to them
=
I CAN WATCH FOREVAH!!!
=
This is amazing! It needs more views.
=
めっちゃかっこいい😭😭😭鳥肌たった。mamamoo好きすぎる…
=
Omg... I love this!! No cringy hip sways over an over ! They are actually fun to watch! They actually offer a different scene than your average gg!! Thank you!
=
화사 보컬은 진짜 독보적이다. 국내에서 저런 보컬을 들을 수 있다는 게 놀라움
=
Newly born Moomoo here. Second time to stan a girl group. 2ne1's my first.
=
I still prefered AOA's 'Sorry' and (G)I-DLE's 'Lion', but this was impressive. Never got into Mamamoo, but they are good.
=
whee’s voice... there’s no words
=
1:28 부분 너무 멋있다 ㅠㅠ
=
6팀 중에 camera 가 젤 못잡은듯. 제대로 안무볼라하면 댄서잡고 이리저리..
=
damn the VOCALS!!!
=
*4:40** solar wowed me in this part*
=
Wonderful❤
=
The best🥰
=
Lmao haters be all mmm won because they were popular but the one with the most views is not mmm's videos either
 
They won because ppl voted for them judging on their talent, not popularity.
=
마마무가 확실히 음색이 개쩐다.
=
타팬인데 반하게 생겼네..
=
Ending pose ❤️❤️❤️
=
gosh they are epic!
=
The only group with fanchant, the only group that interacts with the audience, the only group without lip sync throughout the whole show!
=
I came here everyday just like freshie to check out their live performances
=
I really wanted gidle to win queendom, but damn, this is so amazing
=
Nearly forgot to watch this today
=
귓속에서 자꾸 문별 파트가 맴돌아 ㅠ
=
3:00 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ but u slay girl
=
전 Hip보다 이 노래가 더 좋은 거 같아요. 물론 개인적인 취향이겠지만...
=
It's 5 minutes long but it's still too short.
=
문별언니....사랑해요..대박입니다. ..
=
마마무는 참 신기한 그룹인듯. 보통 그룹에선 메인보컬한명에 서브해줄 리드보컬 한명정도만 뽑는데, 모든 멤버를 메인보컬감으로 뽑아서 기획한 것부터..이런 경연프로그램에서 너무나도 최적화된 그룹.
=
, my feelings now are up and down at the same time...mamamoo i love you girls, i want to see the video of this song
=
잠만 마마무 무슨 일이야 왜이래 저게 얼굴이야? 그럼 내 목위에 있는 이건 뭐야?
=
소속사가 좀더 스케일 크게 해줬으면 어땠을까 하는 생각이듬 진짜 소름돋게 잘했지만 조금만 더 뭘 넣어줬으면 더 레전드였을것같음
=
Moonbyul : can you handle it? 

Solar : ofcourse i can

Moonbyul : okey, just do it baby 

3:02 😍
=
AOA surprised the audience for giving a bombastic opening performance. The crowd loved their concept and attitude onstage. First performance = major blast. That was one of the best opening performances in KPOP. 

Lovelyz went out their comfort zones in a whole new dimension of performance. You can't deny that they have an outstanding teamwork. They are equally talented and they left their mark onstage: the shimmer and glamour. That was splendid.

Park Bom is an amazing woman. A woman of power. How can she deliver that soulful performance without crying? Because the crowd was left gasping and wanting for something to go back. The song is gold. It makes you feel broken and complete at the same time. And Park Bom? She has her way to make you feel all of those. Indeed, she's a legend then and now. 

Oh My Girl showed an impactful performance. The audience loved the strength they projected onstage. The looks in their eyes: it was fire. People was inspired by their dedication to their craft. They owned the stage at the very moment of their performance. That was such a strong final act and believably OMG's. 

(G)-IDLE looked majestic. Visually, they had the thickest stage setup with the props and all. They looked extravagant sending off a fiery charisma. Their performance justified their preparation. The energy was outstanding. You can see their hunger to perform and eat the audience live like a lion. They are promising and certainly they can achieve more heights.

Mamamoo was hot and cold. One has given an ample time to show off their own strengths (that as expected, made the audience felt weak). They can give off antonyms for an unknown reason. They can smile then bite. The can summon fire then ice. You expect them to do their best but you are still surprised. Mamamoo just did a Mamamoo. Simple, elegant but oozing with stage presence. Last blow for the stage: and that was a major wreckage. The connection to the audience just came naturally. They broke barriers once again. Again, they are beyond KPOP. 

Now, let us all be reminded that Queendom (how much we doubted and hated it at first) maybe has its message: empower women. 

So why bring other women down when in fact the 6 groups uplift each other? 

Toxicity kills the truest message. This show is more than a competition- it's more on celebrating women's strength and passion. 

So why spread hate? Join the force because every woman in Queendom deserves the crown as what Moonbyul said. 

Bashful comments for Mamamoo? Just LOL because the fandom chose to remain cool.🤟👑
=
did anyone else noticed solar almost falling down omg i was so worried but at least she acted like nothing happened  woah queeeeennnn 
THEY DESERVE ITTTTTTTTTTT
=
Their vocals sent me to heaven 🥰
=
3:02 ANYONE REALIZE SOLAR ALMOST FELL OMG BABY ARE U OKK???
=
3:02초 솔라 넘어질 뻔 했다우ㅜㅠㅠㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 귀여워ㅠㅜㅜ
=
4명인데 무대 장악력 장난아님ㄷㄷ
=
Honestly, can you even argue their win?
=
every time, the rapper shows up is right on point! and this song is a huge song, it has everything within a song...
=
03:03 I see you Solar
=
Mamamoos stage presence is so powerful, they don't need any extra choreo or props 😍👑
=
이렇게 보컬이 쎈 그룹이면 랩이 죽을만도 한데 전혀 안죽는거 보면 문별도 대단함
=
OMG!! I can't stop listening thi song!
=
화사 음색이 너무 좋아ㅏㅏㅠㅠㅠ
=
Solaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!! u r my destiny!
=
I can't wait to listen the new album😭😭😭omg

=

=
3:00 I hope solar is okay after she tripped omg
=
1:57 minha morte
=
마마무가 몸풀면 일어나는 일 =1위는 따놓은것
=
I can imagine if they are on stage with Big Bang. Their spirit, their energy can equal with that king grup. I can feel the on fire wild vibe of 2ne1 flag in this Mamamoo 🔥🔥
=
보컬도 짱이구 넘 걸크ㅠㅠ
=
Thoughts on lip sync community?
MMM: We don't respect it, it ain't us and we akh-tu on them.
( reference to Hwasa's spitting scene in HIP mv)
=
Hwasa is so hot omg
=
그냥 지나가던 일반인인데..... 마마무 역대 노래 중 최고 같다 ㅠㅠ 너무 좋네요 빨리 이 곡으로 활동해주세요 만번쯤 들을게
=
the definition of *power vocals*
=
I’m so proud of them!! ♥️ they really worked hard and this final stage is AMAZING. So excited for their comeback 😍
=
love them, but I wish they would incorporate more estetics and concepts from Korea instead of from the USA.
=
I’m shook the chorus caught me off guard but as expected we all knew mamamoos songs will come out amazing 😱🤩
=
MAMAMOO really know how to engage an audience like no other. 
Their vocals are what makes a legend.
Four outstanding and strong women.
=
My favorite girl group ever❤️.... The vocal is soo powerfull🔥🔥 I'm fangirling again🥳🥳
=
Moonbyul ❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
My wives delivered per usual- but them backup dancers were doing moves that were beyond average human core strength 💪🏿✌🏿😌
=
We stan queen 😭😭😭
=
나 콘서트본줄 알았어 근데 문별 랩할때 오지게 잘생겨서 엄청치임 최애가 그냥 전체였는데 문별일정도로 매우 치임
=
[ 3:00 ] a cute scene in Solar
=
3:01 LMAO
=
2:55  문별 멋있당
여자가 이렇게 멋있어 보이는건 첨
=
When is their solo comeback as prize for queendom?
=
대체 단체 군무때 카메라 뒤로 빠져서 무대 자랑하는 카메라 워킹은 어느나라 식임?? 카메라 리허설은 뭣하러 하는거야? 가수들만 모니터링 시키지말고 너네도 좀 해라 너네가 진짜 훨씬 더 시급함
+)답글로 가수에 대한 분탕글 안 받아요 돌아가세요
=
no one: ....
queendom: ....




Solar: *slipped by her loose bottom at **3:02* ~Oopps I did it again~ 😂
And continues to walk like nothing happened like a queen.
=
3:02 솔라 삐끗
=
Set you free~
 oh my wheein  im died ❤️😲
=
2:59 뒤에 솔라 발 삐끗...퓨
=
뭐가 많이 없어도  .. 백댄서는 부족해도 무대장악력은 맘무임 ..
=
We need a dance practice for this omg they are so damm good :> nah we shouldn’t stress them but if they can video one, that would be great cos I love mamamoo dances especially this knife-kill part (idk lol)
=
위얼- 케이팝-
암넷ㅌ~
=
우다운 다른 시상식에서도 보고싶다고 진짜 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
The true queens!
=
진짜 노래 장난아니다... 워낙 4명이 목소리가 독보적이라 딴아이돌이 불렀음 이런 느낌 안남 목소리들이 다 집중하게 만들고 무엇보다 포스가ㅎㄷㄷ
=
I love Hwasa's expressions in this
=
1등은 정해져 있었다ㅜㅜ 당연 마마무 ㅜㅜ
=
Solar slips at 3:02! Omg why is she always slipping😭 kept going, professional yeba 👍👍
=
My mom loved Hwasa

=
문별언니 리즈갱신 중이야ㅠㅜㅜ 언니 진짜 내 인생의 처음이자 마지막 여돌입니다ㅠㅜㅜ사랑합ㄴ둥ㅠㅜㅜ💖
=
3:02 Solar! Be careful. I am scared for your ankles!
Is it just me or are those the same shoes she wore for good luck. Those shoes must be out to get her.
=
난 화사의 노래 중간중간 외치는
구령? 추임새? 이런것에 미친다
그래서 입덕했지만ㅋㅋ 넘 멋있다.
입 삐쭉 거리는 거랑ᆢ

=
4:17 화사 원몰타임 헷! 이거 되게 킬링포인트☆
=
3:02 Wheein almost tripped there, cuteee
=
I was a bit worried after seeing all the fabulous looking stages from the other groups but honestly this stage just showed that Mamamoo don’t need any cool props nor lighting, all they need is a microphone and themselves. 😭💕
=
Oh my god! I loved!!!!
=
The fangirl screams when Moonbyul raps is a mood
=
시간이  지날수록  잘하네  에너지가  넘치네 ,,,,
=
시발 존나 멋있다 이 말 밖에는 ..... 할 슈가 업쓰요 진짜 레전드 오브 레전드 무대다 ㅠ 아 너무 좋네 진짱

=
i love Hwasa so much when she start to smile with that thick lipstick 4:09
=
Queens: MAMAMOO 🔥
=
I can't stop smiling. They are so amazing!
=
This really almost made me cry bc they made this performance very beautiful and they deserve a lot more appreciation than they already do🙏😩😢You can definitely tell that they've  come a long way and have put in the hard work to get where they are now.  
Some people are going to hate on them , but at end of the day MAMAMOO stands at the top. PERIODT🍵. And at 3:02 I hope Solar's okay bc she almost tripped.
=
THE STAGE PRESENCE IS NO JOKE
=
Mamamoo is iconic!
=
Mamamoo never fails to make any stage into a concert. Just this is WOW.
=
That's amazing. It's crazy how good and comfortable they are on stage. And Hwasa opening the song at the beginning should be a thing my goodness
=
휘인 음색 진짜 crazy?
=
The only performance where audience sing along.
=
Soooo Queendom = Mamamoo are AMAZING concert queens + Park Bom is lonely & misses 2ne1 😭
=
3:01 솔라 넘어질뻔했어 ㅠㅠ
=
Oh wow!!! You know? I love mamamoo so much!
=
02:21 문별 입꼬리 올리고 화사 입꼬리 내리는 거 넘나 치명적;;
=
spoiler ahead;

When they won, I cried with them— I’m so proud of them and I’m too overwhelmed. I guess I can’t sleep tonight. Thank you MAMAMOO, thank you Moomoos. Thank you because we all worked hard!!! MAMAMOO COMEBACK SHOW LEGGOOOOOO!
=
하...문별 진짜ㅠㅠ 치인다.. 제 심장 어쩔거에요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ

=
3:01 보면 솔라 넘어질 뻔 했는데 바로 표정연기... ㄷㄷ
=
Mnet: Ok, so what genre do you want?

MMM: YES
=
mamamoo why are you in a hurry during the chorus? 😂
=
멤버들이 노래를 다 메보급으로 잘해ㄷㄷ
=
진짜 다잘하는 그룹이다.. 멤버중 구멍도없고 다 개잘하고 너무좋네
=
I've heard this song many times and still feels great😍😍♥️😆😆
=
진짜 알비덥 돈좀써라...최종횐데 세트고 뭐고 아무것도없냐... 마마무 실력덕분에 이정도 된거지.. 돈더썼으면 진짜 역대급나올수있었을텐데
=
이노래 요즘 맨날들음 개좋다 진짜
=
Guitars rly suit their concept 🤧💖
=
best girls groups💕
=
I saw you solar 😅 such a pro...
=
외모 레전드 찍음... 솔라 백금발 별이빛나는밤때도 미치게 예뻤는데 하 ㅠㅠ 화사 저 단발인듯 묘한머리 너무 잘어울리고 별이 표정너무쩔고 휘인이는 파란머리가 저렇게 잘어울릴일..? 1등까지하니까 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 역시 마마무
=
Da BEST!!!!!!!🤯🤯❤️❤️❤️
=
I really prefer MAMAMOO's live ver than their studio ver. It's just so satisfying to listen.
=
2:38 심쿵 당했어ㅠㅜㅜㅠ 고개 내리고 눈빛발사.. 완전 심쿵ㅠㅜㅠ와아 솔라느님❤❤ 화사언니는 단발 너무 섹시해ㅠㅠㅠ 젖은머리 최고야!!!..
=
맘무 충성충성 ㅠㅠ7핵멋짐 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
그냥..마마무가 마마무했다!
처음부터 순위에 연연하지않고 무대만 생각하는 모습에 멋지다고 생각했는데 그 결과가 최종 1위로 나타나서 참 뿌듯합니다.
예나 지금이나 앞으로나 무대가 기대가 되는 그룹이네요. 멋진 작품 보여주셔서 정말 감사합니다!
=
I hated this song at begining but now im in love with it❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
If they won by popularity, then why G-idle didnt win????
=
they are queens！
=
my queens!
edit: why solar always slip xD
=
Moonbyul : destiny makes me cry, destiny makes me smile

Moomoo : destiny makes us win

혜진이 독무할때 헐 미쳤다 했는데 
뒤에서 댄서들이 용 들고 나오는거 보고 입을 틀어막고 아무말 못함..ㅜ

=
I really love them....
=
OK THIS TIME THIS IS REALLY FOR THE LESBIANS, LESBIANS SAY THANK YOU MAMAMOO
=
문별님 옷 너무 좋아요ㅠㅠ
=
3:57 따따따따 따따따 엑시트...?
=
진짜 무대에 돈좀써라 대표야.. 애들 실력으로만 커버치려하지말고 저쪽에서 끽소리도 못할정도로 한번은 확 보여줬어야지 진짜 애들 실력만믿고 돈안쓰고 애들한테 다 맡기고 저비용고효율타령하니까 애들 쓰러지고 컨디션이 지랄맞아지지 지랄같은놈아 저비용고효율이맘무한테 알이서하라는거 더있냐 안무가랑 무대연출도 좀 도 하고 댄스팀도 좀 더 쓰고 이런 좀 크다싶은 무대에선 돈좀 써야하지않겠냐
=
What is this show called? I love finding new kpop artist/ groups.
=
Their voices give me chills and I love it😍😍❄️🔥
=
휘인 춤선봐..와..
=
2:34 왜 신은 날 지치게 만들고 인줄 알았어ㅋㅋㅋ갠적으로 이 부분 너무 좋음 뒤에 이어지는 문별 랩도...☆
=
마마무 단독콘서트하는거 가틈..
=
지금까지 문별님이 했던 랩중에 제일 좋네요 ㅠㅜ
=
What is this? Perfection.

Tell me if they're lacking on things, I'll wait.



*EXACTLY*.
=
내가 무무인 이유가 있어
실력도 실력이고 , 진짜 멋지니까
언니들 사랑해요 .
=
별이 빛나는 밤에 에다가 가을을 끼얹으면 이런 느낌이겠지?
=
Una de las mejores presentaciones de MAMAMOO

=
어 근데 다 잘한다는 거 알겠는데 휘인 이번에 너무 이쁘다 머리 잘어울려
=
의상이 노래랑 춤에 너무 어울려서 보기 좋은 무대
=
They got fan vote for them, yes, because their beauty? Remember Netizen used to diss their beauty? Huh anti fan? Don’t tell me that your reason to claim that they don’t deserve to win
=
3:00 쯤에 솔라 삐끗했는데 아무일 없었다는 듯이 노래하네.........역시 갓마마무...
=
Mamamoo never lets us down! You are legendary!!!
=
박봄이 왜 마마무를 보면서 2ne1 시절을 보는거 같다고 말하는지 알게하는 무대인듯
=
There voices sooo goood!!!❤️
=
The way they interact and hype up the crowd like that, no wonder they won first place.
=
They just radiate Queen Energy! SO HAPPY THEY WON! They deserve it ♥️🔥
=
이걸 하루에 몇번을 보는지...ㅋㅋ
=
HOW MANY TALENTS DO YOU WANT FOR THIS STAGE, MAMAAMOO ?


ME: YE-


*MAMAMOO : RATATATATATATATATAAAAA*
=

다른건 몰라도 라이브랑 노래는 마마무가 다 씹어 먹더라... 노래 녹음하는 부분 나올 때 본방 본 사람은 알거임 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 각각 한소절 부를때마다 개소름돋음
=
Well, Solar almost fall in 3:03
=
화사랑 솔라 앉아서 서로 앉을때 조합이 너무좋다..
=
휘인 set me free 크....미쳣다 이거보고 입덕ㅎ...
=

=
카메라 겁나 정신사나워서 마마무 잘안보임 분명 문별 솔로인데 문별보다 관객이랑 댄서분들이랑 문별정수리밖에 안찍어 왜;; 빨리 직캠 올려줬으면
=
Mamamoo deserves international fame and success

=
화사 진짜 섹시를 사람으로 표현한거 같았음 저런 머리에 구릿빛피부 자기만의 제스처 진짜 아무에게 없는 매력
=
노래는 이미 폰에 다운되어 있는데 무대연출이 너무 좋아서 계속 보러온다ㅜㅜ 춤,노래, 모든게 완벽ㅜㅜ
=
진짜 잘하긴 하네 마마무가
=
역시 마마무 1등할만하다
=
no matter what, this performance is really the best, I love this so much 😍💖
=
hwasa's opening scene alone had more stage presence, charisma and vocal skills than most performances on music show stages
=
마마무 퀸덤 영상보고 입덕해버렸어요...언니들...못하는게뭐에요 정말...?
=
just queen behaviour. support their comeback! :D
=
Mamamoo vocal power's just so amazing.
=
돈냄새도 거의 안 나는 이 무대로 우승했다고 툴툴대는 이상한 사람들이 많네?
혹시 마지막 무대에는 점수가 더 많고 그러니까 이상하다고 하는 건가? 
마지막 무대에는 점수가 하나도 방영 안 됨. 
1,2,3차 경연에 점수가 있고 음원순위가 있고 문투가 있음. 처음부터 그렇게 룰이 있었고 모두들 동의했음. 
마지막 무대를 보고 문투결정하지 않냐고? 곡을 1주일 전부터 공개했는데? 장성규가 투표 시작!할 때 거의 대부분이 투표를 끝냄. 
이 마지막 무대는 문투할 시간벌기용이고 퀸덤 끝내기 맛보기용이야. 어떤 팀에게는 마지막으로 시청자들에게 인상을 남길 기회일테고. 마마무는 정규 컴백도 같이 준비하고 있었으니 소속사에서도 돈을 허투로 낭비하기 힘들었겠지.
=
마마무의 목소리는 힐링~~💜💜
=
I'm fall in love with them 😭😭😭
=
The ending is a work of art
=
03:01 Solar slips. 뒤에서 솔라 걸어나오면서 미끄덩함~ 큰일날 뻔 😍
=
문스타... 크으으으
=
The only perf with fanchants that loud.
=
누구 기저귀 좀 갖다줘라 무대 지렸음 이건 레알1위무대다
=
Please mamamoo perform this for the MAMA 2019 ❤️
=
The final winer is MAMAMOO.
IT CANNOT BE DENIED AND DIFIED.
=
Imagining collaboration between moonbyul and han from stray kids, i think it will be the great performance.
=
Wow powerful voices 😍
=
Cant wait for their cb
=
Perfectas y hermosas como siempre 😍😍😍😍😍😍
=
it's not about extravagant outfits.
it's not about the stage presentation & props.
it's not about the huge fandom.

it's about talent and these four showed everyone how they deserve to get the title “Queendom”
=
I know there isn't such thing as perfection,  but.... this was just pure perfection 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
=
3:26 hwasa is a bit late on the dance lol still slayed
=
Omg that fall at the end
=
Solar is so hot, damn.
=
ok they deserve to b part of BB50 RETWEET AND COMMENT !!
=
퀸덤에서 나온 노래 다 좋음..진짜ㅜㅜ 작곡부터 보컬 랩 춤 그냥 다 끝내줌 2한번 더 하자  진짜
=
3:24 it looks like she was about to cry.
=
소속사 개같은 진짜 마지낙 파이널 무댄데 좀 밀어주면어디 덧나냐 에휴 진짜 회사하는짓보면은...
우리 맘무가 다먹여살린다 맘무가 다 먹어살려....
=
혜진이 단발로 이미 게임 끝이다 무무들 다 죽었다...
=

=
솔라 넘 이쁘당~~^^
=
생방땐 몰랐는데 용 넘어질 뻔 했네ㅠㅠ
=
0:58 와이파이를 밀어냈지...
=
휘인 화사.. 이 보컬조합은 아무리봐도 사기야... 반칙이야..
=
3:02 솔라님 넘어질뻔 ㅠㅅㅠ 다행이다
=
Did anyone notice Solar almost fell at 3:02 and Moonbyul was looking to see of she was alright? 😭 my moonsun hearteu
=
고음은 앞부분에 멜로디가
칠해줘랑 비슷한것같음.,
=
Hwasa's skin tho. So beautiful
=
미쳤다... 진짜 이런말 잘 안하는데 오졌다......... 무릎꿇을게요 언니들.... 진짜 최고다 마마무가 무대 다 찢었다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
tipico diferenciar los gritos de move-nim de fondo XD
=
Why moonbyul always looks like minhyuk btob but female ver
=
휘인 누나 음색 정말 매력적이에요 정말 잘했고 멋있었어요 고마워요 열심히 해줘서
=
Mamamooooooooo... Oh my god! This is too good to be truuuee!
=
조합이 이렇게 완벽한 그룹은 처음보네 국내한정 걸그룹으론 이미 레전드의 반열에 올랐다 보컬 춤 랩 빈틈이 없네 그리고 괴물인건 마마무는 행사가 타그룹보다 많은 수준이던데 행사 섭외 1위에다가 수많은 프로그램에 
앨범도 곡도 매년마다 꾸준히나오고 

중간에 멤버하나 쓰러질정도로 활동하던데 미친건가싶다....
=
무무는 광대가승천!💘💘💘ㅠㅜ
화사님넝무ㅏㅜㅑㅠ ㅡㅠ이뽑
=
휘인 목소리 개좋아
=
this is awesomeeeeee
=
im inlove with the girl who wore white
=
얘들은 회사에서 돈좀쓰면 좋을텐데. 앨범나올때 보면 뮤비나 의상이나 무튼 회사가 돈을 잘안쓰는느낌 .
=
Hwasa be looking like a whole meal
=
Solar almost tripped again D:
=
Oh man this song... IS SO FRICKEN GOOD WTHHHH
=
Suka bngt part nya monbyul 😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
=

=
Wooooooow!!! They really deserved to win, no one can deny it.. look at that talent, voices, choeography, energy, cool..! I love Mamamoo
=
진짜 미쳤다
=
LIVE VOCAL QUEENS
=
Hwasa’s expressions are to die for.... I love them
=
문별 파트 가사..너무 예쁘다
=
네버랜드지만 마마무 진짜 경연무댈 자기들 콘서트로 만드는순간 1위직감 했다
낼 새벽출근이지만 마마무 1위하는거 보고 잘려고 그지같은 광고와 진행 참고 버텻다. 다들 잘했고 마마무는 역시나다.
=
03:01 솔라언니 삐끗
=
뭐 마마무 무대 천재인건 알고 있었음 ,,
=
How.POWERFUL!!!
=
문스타 멋지다! 마마무 축하해요 👍
=
Mamamoo starting Queendom as the first performer on the first eps with a SPARK. And today they ended Queendom as the last performer on the last eps with a BLAST 🔥
=
너무멋잇다..마마무♡
=
Moonbyul rap's always shock me. And thats legit girl
=
화사는 볼때마다 외국에 있었으면..생각하게 된다
=
넘산데.....??????!!!!
=
마마무 회사는 돈 좀 썼으면; 애들은 해외진출 씹어먹을 급인데 소속사 수준이 동네장난이네
=
3:02 솔라님 삐끗하신거 같은데 발목 괜찮으신가요ㅜㅠ!!
=
This is really GOOOooD
=
나는 무무여서   짧게  얘기함❤역시. 마마무❤
=
엄마미소로 본다 손
=
4인 4색 그녀들만의 빈 공간이 없는 꽉찬 무대
서로가 서로에게 너무 좋은 시너지 효과를 주고
그에 맞는 무대 연출과 안무
어떻게 안좋아하는 사람이 있을 수 있을까?
=
왜 1등인지 알겠다
=
Stan mamamoo stan talent and ilysb moonbyul
=
omg did noone notice solar tripping on 3:01?
=
Did anyone else see solar trip at 3:03? 😭
=
별이 언니 랩 진짜 레전드 중에 레전드 였고 화사언니는 초반 도입부 목소리 오졌고 용선언니는 곡 분위기랑 너무 찰떡이고 휘인언니는 그냥 목소리가 진짜 레전드 어떻게 사람 목에서 저런목소리가 나오나 싶음
퀸덤 생방송에 마마무 투표했는데 1등해서 너무 좋다...ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
SPEECHLESS
=
This is tanlent, thank you queens
=
Who keep rewatch this performance although it has been long since Queendom end?
=
holy shit this is concert level performance
=
See,,, they’re worth the ending stage
=
haters : MamAmOo cAn'T dAnCE
mamamoo :
=
still not over this. 
im still not over this and i never will
=
I fall in love with the song since it released 😁😆😎
=
와 오마이걸 데스티니 보고 퀸덤입덕하고 이번 게릴라보고 너무 잘해서 뿌듯했는데 아이들 라이온 듣고 소름끼쳤고 설마 마마무도 이럴까해서 들으러 왔는데 파이널이라고 전부 이갈고 나왔구나 ;;;;
=
마마무 수고많았어요ㅠ
휘인이 많이 힘들었을텐데 너무 고마워요ㅠ 우리 마마무 이대로만 가자
=
Mamamoo deserved to win even though I m a neverland here sorry they totally deserved the win I mean I swear this performance gave goosebumps
=
애들이 계속 퀸덤퀸덤해서 보러왔는데,
상가에서 흘러 들은 노래가 너무 좋은데 마마무가 불렀다는 거만 알아고있었는데 이 노래였네요....
+ 0:32 글구 여러분 잘보면 백댄서분들이 솔라언니 들고(?)나와요! 대박ㅠㅜㅠ
=
빵야빵ㅇ야빵야!!!!
마마무 다쏴버려!!!!이거양!!!!
=
풀캠으로 보셈 훨씬 더 좋음
=
와 미친 마마무 곡 중에 레전드 오브 레전드다... 미쳤당
=
Moonbyul, why i like your costume always yours
=
Waiting for mv
=
난솔직히문별이좋다
=
Amo está canción (*+*)
=
문별 파트 레전드다 너무 좋다 진짜 ...
=
Solar 3:01 LMAO
=
잘한다 맘먐뮤 🤭 그래도 퀸덤에선 박봄 응원했음 ㅠ ㅠ 너무 마음이 느껴져서
=
This show was the best, they all win 1st place💖
=
@ ㅋㅋㅋㅋ큐ㅠ삐끗 귀여우셔서 주륵ㅀ주륵
=
I can see why they won if this song had anything to do with it. I thought nothing would top G-Idle, but Mamamoo always dashing my expectations. Like they have the stage presence, the power, and they have fun on stage while interacting with the fans. They are truly amazing. I felt this song and stage in my soul, I can't even explain it. (Another thing I noticed about Mamamoo is that every one of their members always fits their concept no matter what they do, but yet they still all have their own indiviudal style and charisma and they all shine in their own way, like thats something that other groups just don't/can't do)
=
아 노래 진짜 너무좋은데 화사 표정 진짜 이시언이 따라하는거랑 너무 똑같다...ㅎㅎㅎ
=
what an experience
=
우다운 4백만뷰 돌파♡♡
=
중독되네 계속 오게되는군
=
별이 랩파트가 제일 좋다......아니 그냥 노래 다 좋아 미쳤다 정말 근데 별이 랩 진짜 너무좋아.................
=
노래 춤 표정 모두 완벽..
=
this song fuckin slaps iTS SO GOOD
=
In my opinion mamamoo are the best girls group in performing makes you so happy to watch and they always surprise me with their performance
=
So cool, i love mamamoo
=
다른 무대처럼 웅장한 무대연출이나 큰 안무없이 표정, 분위기, 가창력으로 무대를 압살하네...저것도 진짜 타고난끼인듯
=
문별이 라따따따 하는 파트 춤출때 팔에 달린 실들이 날리는게 너무 예뻐요....
팔에 팔랑거리는게 개인적으로 날개  닮아서 철새가 어떤 새와 사랑에 빠졌는데 시간이 지나서 그 새와 떠나게되는데 시간이 지나고 예전에 만났던 곳에서 다시 만나게 될거라는 내용이 연상되기도 하는것 같아요ㅠㅜㅜㅜ
=
2:59 솔라 걸어오다 넘어질뻔 했네 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Always Mamamoo is the queen of K Pop
=
im not surprised they won tbh lol. they hyped up the crowd and put a twist into the song instead of serving it plain. job well done, mamamoo. congrats on winning
=
마마무가 마마무했다. 
실력이 받쳐주니까 뭔 컨셉을 해도 다 소화한다는게 퀸덤 파이널 우승을 쥐고 가는듯.
11월 컴백 응원합니다 !!!!!

아니 곡 너무 좋잖아...
=
이건 노래가 넘사로 좋음 역대
=
this song deserved a mv
=
Mamamoo😍

am i the only one being emotional when watching this? especially the "ratatata" part with kmoos' chant?
im just so happy for our queens 😭
=
the camerawork is just... *chef kisses*
=
雞皮嘎搭阿~~太棒了!!!!!
=
The Queens of Korea 🙏🏻😄
=
Solar really isn't having any luck with her shoes in this series is she lol She always manages to stay looking professional though <3
=
젭알 컴백 준비 때문에 돈 많이써서 이거바께 못해줬다고 해줘요 8ㅁ8 마지막 무댄데...
=
타팬인데 문별님 웃을 때마다 설렌다..
=
헐리웃 안부럽다 ㄹㅇ
=
This perform is everything
=
무대 소품 뭐 이런거 없고 진짜 무대가 멋져서 너무 멋있는 그룹인것 같다
=
Las mejores ❤❤.Adoro su fuerza y vocal,son impresionantes 💓💓
=
갓마무♡♡
=
Solar being clumsy again at 1, 2, 3:00
=
문별 옷 진짜 카우걸 같다...짱 예뻐(3:02 에 솔라 무대로 올 때 발 걸린거 순간 놀랐음..ㄷㄷ)
=
haters : mamamoo can't dance while singing.

mamamoo : okay, hold my cowboy hat
moomoo : say sike right now
=
Solar fell in the background at 3:02 HELLO OBSERVANCE
=
역시는 역시네 역시 믿듣맘무
=
It was good and the deserved to be the winner. But I am a little sad that oh my girl didnt won :(
=
Ok but this song and whole stage is the definition of crying in the club. One moment we're bopping so hard and by the end of Wheein's last note and that hug, you bet my ass was tearing up. Mamamoo really did that.
=
진짜 이노래 너무좋아 어쩜좋아 정식앨범으로 얼른 발매도ㅙㅆ음좋겠다
=
여러분 풀캠으로 보세요 ㅠㅠ 안무랑 동선이 더 잘 보여서 더욱 멋있습니다!!!

=
마마무 솔라 휘인 회사 문별.김지현 솔라. 언니 예쁜
=
this song is so good, will definitely check mamamoo out
=
to those saying mamamoo won because we got a "big" fandom. did u think only moomoos streamed their song? the general public streamed their song, thats why they charted! we don't actually have 100 accts each to stream every minute so we promote them so hard and it actually pays off plus the song is amazing thats why. so what if your faves performance was trending, did their fans stream the songs tho? did the people who watched their perf streamed their song also? stop saying its ALL about the fandom numbers, we worked our asses off in promoting them too. its the numbers + amazing performance + hardwork of mamamoo and moomoos that got us that no. 1
=
unbelievable voice！
=
Back here~
=
AME TODO ME ENCANTO 💖💖💖
=
i just finished the final episode and just watching their performance again is like my soul is stolen
=
일단 노래부터 1위확정...무대까지 진짜 좋다
=
파이널 노래 다 좋다..
=
This is additive
=
I hope they perform this once again on Music Show
=
I'm not interest in kpop but this gp girl make me love their vocal song how can I search their song ..are they new.just stream their song starry night its cool
=
미쳤어 진짜 ., 진짜 미쳤다는 소리밖에 안 나옴. 마마무만 할 수 있는 그런 무대여서 보는 내내 너무 벅찼고 무무라서 너무 행복했어요. 정말 수고했어요 마마무 놓지않을게 🤙🏻❤️
=
Wheein's visuals are killing me, I swear
=
THE QUEENS HAVE WENT AND DONE IT AGAIN! I STG IF THEY DON'T WIN 1ST THERE'S GONNA BE A WAR!!!
=
damn this b the same level (maybe a lil higher) as kill this love
=
anyone notice solar tripping in the back at 3:01 or is it just me ?
=
엠넷은 왜 맨날 라이브 목소리 잘 안들리게 엠알을 크게 틀어놓는거지? 그럴 필요 없는 가수한테는 하지 마 좀! 아니면 음향 시설에 투자를 하든가
=
솔직히 노래는 마마무였다 무대 퀄리티는 아이들이였다 이말은 할 수 있다
=
Congratulations Mamamoo on winning Queendom, it was a win well deserved and as a fan I'm over the moon. I was a little hesitant in wanting to watch as I didn't like the concept of the show pitting female artist's against each other but I was so curious to see what you would bring to the table. I'm so glad my curiosity got the best of me because not only did you deliver each week with your vocals, stage presence and charisma but you also exposed groups to me that I never knew I needed nor knew existed. I started watching this show as a fan of Mamamoo and Park Bom but now the show has ended I'm a fan of all the contestants involved and I can't wait to see what everyone does in the future. Congrats again Mamamoo for winning the show and congrats to G Idle, AOA, Lovelyz and OMG for winning over a new fan.
#MultiStan
=
queendom is the perfect hashtag!! hwasa's face is just the best when she's feeling it :D also this song sounds a little like starry night and I love it!!
=
Mamamoo queens of queendom 👑👸❤😘😍👌
=
근데 카메라 왤케 별로냐 멤버별 직캠이나 내놔라
=
그래서 솔로 무대는 언제 할껀데 왜 안보여줘.??
=
It's another level...
=
MAMAMO❣
=
Goosebumps
=
Mamamoo didn't even have a heavy dance, but their stage presence will make your jaw drop.
=
4명이서 다 했네!! 멋져!!

=
역시 마마무 💚
=
solar trip at the back
=
They are so perfect
=
ㅅㅂ 마마무쫌 그만깎아내려 1위할만했잖아  댄서 많이 없어도 무대허전하지도않고 노래좋고 퍼포먼스도 좋았는데 누구가 좋았다 1위왜함?팬덤빨이다라고 댓글달만큼 못했지않고 팬덤도 실력이야 그리고 데뷔경력도 다른데 팬덤이 많지 그리고 마마무가 소속사가 제일 약해 그럼 다른아이돌들 1위하면소속사빨이라고해줄까?
=
I’m shook
=
So they won? I’m happy!
=
갓마무
=
I like the performance but I don't get the cowgirl outfits
=
퀸덤에서 1위한거 잊지 않고 쉬다가 11월 컴백에서는 더 좋고 건강한 모습으로 보기를.. 또 레전드 무대 만들었네 ㅎㅎ 마마무가 마마무 했네.. 이 기세로 음방에서도 1위 가자!!!!!
=
화사휘인 음색 미쳤는데 요새 휘인 미모가 더 미쳤고.. 솔라언니 개섹시하고 문별 진짜.. 여자들한테 왜 인기 많은지 알겠음. 잘생쁨의 정석. 랩할때도 춤출때도 왠만한 남자들 보다 멋있음 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 날 가져ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
ㅈㄴ멋있다
=
Essa música é Perfeita !!! 🇧🇷
=
사실 aoa,아이들,옴걸 응원하려고해서  그무대만 집중해서 보고 다른무댄 다른거 했는데 진짜 마마무는 아무생각없이 집중하면서 봄...
=
화사 솔라 도입부 미침
=
They’re truly on another level.. I havent had a performance give me AO MUCH chills like this has in such a long long time... They’re energy, their vibe, how they care themselves.... no one is on their level, no one can pull off what they can pull off. Their vocals were amazing and I was glued to the performance. Everything about it, so so good. Im so proud of them. True artists and performers.
=
영어가 왜 맨날 위에있는지;;;;한국어 댓 왜 저어어어어어밑에있음;;

Mamamoo is unreal, how does anyone pull off a performance like this! Stan Mamamoo STAN TALENT

They win because they are popular? Yup, they are popular because of their voice❤️ that's it🌸
=
I've only listened to 2 of their songs but this performance made me stan😍😍

=
아 진짜 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 팬덤빨 팬덤빨 웅앵웅 이 짓거리 할거면 제발 입 다물었으면 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이미 결정 난 일이고 모든 팀들이 잘했고 앞으로 더 승승장구할 6팀인데 왜 무개념이 들어와서 분위기 망치냐고 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 할 일 없으면 잠이나 자지 진짜 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
지금까지 있어왔던 모든 여자그룹중에 탑이지 않을까  가창력 무대 장악력 댄스 뭐하나 빠지는거 없고 이쁘기만한 여자아이돌들과는 확실히 다른 아우라가 있는듯!!멋지다!!^^
=
2:22 화사님 여기서 이러시면..?
=
나는 마마무가 핸드 마이크 쓰는게 왜 이렇게 좋지....너무 멋있어,,

=
Omg. I glad she didnt fall.. 3:01
=
맨날 소품 부족하고 돈 안 쓰지ㅡㅡ 마마무가 노래랑 분위기로 무대 채워주니까 소속사 돈 안쓰지 쉬바 무대 구석구석 활용해서 꽉 채운 느낌 주는데 맘무 1등할 삘 왔었는데 파이널에 돈 발라주지 진짜
=
다보고 진짜 헛웃음밖에 안남ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 미친듯이 잘해서.....
=
I wish we had an mv

진짜 애들이 다살렸네ㅋㅋㅋㅋ옆동네 아이들 에이오에이는 진짜 투자빵빵하게 해준거같은데 제일 유망주그룹이 무대구성이 왤케 허전해...
노래퀄이랑 마마무 실력이 살린 무대다...
=
This slappppss
=
Fake moomoos dosent know what is going to happen tommorrow
=
Solar tripped- did anyone see that
=
Gosh the fanchants 😩
=
Who cares if they don't do a powerful choreography? They are singers, dance it's just an extra
=
Anyone realise the trip at 3:03
=
can't wait for the MV
=
Speechless WOW
=
노래 좋은데...아쉬운건 제목이너무길어ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 우린결국다시만날운명이였지 할때 뭔가 쫓기듯이 와다다 노래부르는게 아쉽다
=
마마무 무대 한마디로 말하자면 "미쳤다"
=
Goosebumps all over

와.... 화사... 내가 저렇게 파워풀하게 생겼으면 입술에 춘장 고추장 된장 간장 색 다 발라본다 어떤 기분일까ㅠㅠ 부럽다ㅠㅠ
=
Really love mamamoo
=
True talent!!!😍😍😍
=
이길 만했다
=
화사가 바른 립색깔 어올리는 사람 별로없는데 화사 전나 찰떡이네 와
=
퀸덤 시작하기 전부터 그리고 파이널 날까지 당연히 마마무가 1등을 할 것이라 생각했다. 그런데 마마무는 단 한번도 자신들의 순위를 당연하게 생각하지 않았다. 늘 겸손했고 무대에 최선을 다했다. 그런 모습들이 진정한 퀸의 자세가 아닐까.
=
I hope they can perform this song at any awards show
=
Vocal game is always on point 👌 👌 👌
=
2.42 I likes this part it like linked park song

=
Nobody does it like mamamoo.
=
mamamoo is talented.
=
음원으로 들을때는 그냥 그랬는데 안무랑 무대를 보니까 완전 좋다
=
No. 1 queendom??? Just wow!!
=
마마무 노래가 젤 좋은 것 같다...
=
솔직히 1화부터 넘사였3

Okay I desist, I just CAN'T find a bias in this group.

Hoping yt's not gonna sue me for pressing replay buttons a million times since this song was posted here. Mamamoo answered your issues with ratata tatata!(machine guns sounds)😂
=
이번편은 다른것보다 더 신경쓰고 이악문게 보인다 팬들 한번 더 보겠다고 1등하고싶어하던 마마무 짱 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ ❤️
=
I've been listening to Mamamoo eversince their debut. I was amazed by their vocals, I have their songs in my playlist but never really dived deep. As a kpop fan, I'm more of a lurker. I just like groups but I'm really picky and the only fandom I had was A+ (MBLAQ). They're the only group I loved deeply also almost Cassie but Idk the spark stopped but it doesn't mean I don't like TVXQ. I still love them but not that much affection as I had with MBLAQ. SO TO CUT THIS SHORT. I WANT TO STAN MAMAMOO. CAN YOU GUIDE ME HOW TO ENTER THIS FANDOM CAUSE OH MY GOD I'M SO IN LOVE WITH HOW TRUE THEY ARE ON AND OFF STAGE, HOW TALENTED YET HUMBLE THEY ARE, HOW THEY ENJOY PERFORMING SO MUCH. OMG LIKE I'M SOOOO IN LOVE WITH MAMAMOO RIGHT NOW THAT I'M ABOUT TO FUCKING CRY. HAHAHAHA UGH ILY MAMAMOO
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
This song is so good. It deserved to be their comeback song. They are so incredibly talented.
=
다 좋은데 우린 결국 다시 만날 운명이였지 저 파트 가사 좀 줄여주지... 좀 뭔가 노래리듬 놓쳐서 음악에 안맞게 노래하는것같음..ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 역시  마마무라서 정말 좋았는데 저기서 살짝 깸..
=
근데 여기서 소름돋는건 네명다 핸드마이크라는거 ;;
=
Omfg this is MAMA performance material
=
The song is so good and they have so much presence on stage that it gives me chills. This is what I call artists
=
MOONBYUL'S RAP IN THIS SONG OH MY GOOD GOD

Imagine them collabing with LM and performing together. The world ain't ready

Actually they dont need to dance to get attention, they have charisma and vocals. Individually different and have their uniqueness. Why not to stan MAMAMOO?

Congratulations on being top 10 in billboard digital songs for kpop

I stan a very popular gg (not participating in this competition), a group that is very famous outside Korea (I think you know who I refer to) but Mamammo is on another level. Their stage presence and confidence on stage is something very unique of Mamammo. You can't even call them cute, because their persona says otherwise. They exude sexy and sultry personality which give them a very mature image which is uncommon to Korean pop groups where everyone desires to portray a very cute and innocent representation of themselves. Mamammo don't care about that. They do what they want to do (props up to their recording company for allowing them to have every Independence in their musicality as much as they want)  and Mamammo do it the best way they can, always. When ALL Korean girl groups are  the Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift in Western music; Mamamoo is the ultimate performer, queen Beyonce.

역시 마마무
=
MAMAMOO IS MAMAMOO!
=
We can all hate Mnet for being a snake (let's hope neither Izone nor X1 will be ruined) but no matter how unfair the show, I feel like both Produce and Queendom helped many idols and let them shine, solo or in groups

Love You Mamamoo!!!! 😘😘😘😘
=
solar at 3:02 though hahahahhah
=
.... guys... if an artist uses an actual microphone, that means that MOST LIKELY what you’re hearing is what they’re SINGING LIVE. 



I may be biased, but live music is so much more important than an extravagant dance performance.
=
1:27 
2:41
=
Their live vocals alone is enough to win this...what if you include dance line, charisma,stage performace, style's Yea they are deserved to Win.thats why they are the winner.Congrats Queens!
=
3:02 SOLAR!

시댕 유튜브 개설자분들 한국어좀 보고싶어요.. 얼마나 내려야 한국어를 볼 수 있습니까,,, 짜증나게시리... 외국분들 반응도 좋은데 난 한국무무들으ㅣ 반응 보고싶다고오,,,진짜 이거 개선좀 해줘요,,제봘,,ㅠㅠ
=
미친....마마무가.....이번에 걍 무대 찢었다...아니 발로 부셔버렸다.... 이거다 너희들이 해냈다 미춌다 당분간 당신들 무대만 보고 살거같아...
=
This just gives chill and shivering down my spine every time I watch this
Mamamoo is ABSOLUTELY the best Performers of 3rd Kpop Generation
This stage has everything, the opening, the story, the Climax, the bridge, the fuc king hype beat, the mesmerising end
The experienced and expert skills, the confidence, the self-confidence, the self-acknowledgment they have is EVERYTHING 🤧✨
=
holy crap i rarely see mamamoo dancing so hard they slAYED this man
=
ngl this is the best mamamoo song
=

=
FOR THOSE ANTIS OUT THERE SAID Mamamo DON'T DESERVE THE WIN
have your favs singing live without or little backtrack, playback, pre-record, autotune, lipsync first
then we continue our debate
=
Im a blink,moomoo, blackjack, Neverland, forever, and a merry and they make their own marks and cherish any marks that they make because those are special
=
멤버별 특성은 전혀 다른데 마마무보면 약간 옛날 투애니원이랑 뭔가 비슷한점이 많아서 자꾸 생각나
=
💖
=
팬덤빨로 이겼다는 분들 보세요. 팬덤 작은거에도 이유가 있지 않을까요?? 그렇게 마마무 욕되게 해봤자 님들 연예인 팬덤 작다고 인정하는 꼴밖에 더 될까요?😂😂
=
I hate when some of the fan claim that mamaoo dont deserve 1st place, n think their fav group that are more fresh, young talented are deserve more.. Hey, if u dont know MMM, dont try to condemned them.. They are under rated goup, take a few years to become famous group. Because of what?? Because their voice are so pure and angelic. And they dont care about anything, either they win or not. They performed just for their fan, and they deserved the votes. Please dont question either they got 1st place or not..
=
😍
=
lol Solar at the back @ 3:02
=
마마무 사랑해.. 놓지 않을게ㅠㅠㅠ 시간도 얼마 없었는데 응원법 외워간 무무들도 칭찬해,, 진짜 모든 그룹중에 젤 크고 뚜렷하게 응원법 들려서 너무 뿌듯했어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 언니들.. 내가 씨디 씹어먹으면 몸에 안 좋다 했잖아ㅠㅠ 진짜 그냥 음원 틀어 놓은줄 알았어...ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

I just wish a MV for this and sorry from aoa too is too much?
=
This is the thousand dollar question..... I’m so surprised why they were not given the proper recognition they deserve...... it’s out of question about their talent, and they have their unique style and personality..... not like other common girl groups..... I admire MAMAMOO so much.
=
Good job for all of the dancers support, they all did a great job
=
마마무만 생라이브자나 ㅋㅋ 당연히 1등이징
=
와 문별 랩 역대급인다 제일 좋다 기교 적당히 들어가고ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

=
OMG the starry night vibe
agree?
=
this song is a whole another level I just can't stop singing with them 😭😭💖💖 

but to be fair, stage-wise Lion by (G)i-dle was more advanced as a final stage. 

but ofc I'm not mad at this at all both of the group are so big
=
짱이에요
=
진심 노래랑 안무 너무 좋다... 퀸덤에서만 보이기에 넘 아까울 정도로ㅠ
퀸덤 통해서 마마무 다양한 무대 볼수있어서 넘 좋았어요. 특히 화사는 원래 무대 잘하는거 알았지만 정말 최고....bb
=
They were born to be on stage.
=
الاصوات خورافية عبالك پلي باك😻
=
와와와.... 말이 안나오네 무대를 그냥 갖고 놀았어.... 와.. 나도 가소싶었는데ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

좋아해요

아이들 퍼포먼스 갑이고 마마무 보컬갑이네 진짜 ㅎㄷㄷ;;

what i noticed is mamamoo can make any song fun. ily mamamoo
=
화사 춤출때 입모양 개성있고 자신의 표정에 자신감있는거 매력터지네 나만그럼?
=
1위한건 이해하고 너무 잘하긴 했는데 무대 너무 아깝다... 다른 그룹에 비해 파급력도 별로 없는거 보니... 소속사 돈좀 팍팍 썼으면 좋겠네, 뭐 아이들은 전소연이 작사작곡 편곡 다 하니까 곡비 나갈게 따로 없어서 무대에 전념하는거지만, 마마무 연차가 얼마고 팬덤은 얼마나 많은데 겨우 이런 무대를... 그나마 마마무가 뒷받쳐줘서 돋보인거지.,... 아무튼 잘한다... 노래는 진짜....
=
Aye when will they stop (don't) are they trying to make me question my sexuality
=
my fav 1:12

MAMAMOO is no joke are idols that most k-pop idols should take example of

3:30
=
Worth to stan this group. Despite of all bad comments, treatment by their appearances they're still stayed humble 😭💔 I'm a new fan, but never failed to amazed me and felt that I'm in the luckiest fandom ever!! Congratulations MAMAMOO! YOU ROCK EVERY SINGLE PERFORMANCES IN QUEENDOM!!! 🎉🔥 Deservedly much uwu 👌👏🖤 from  🇵🇭

These vocal queens are truly a total performers but lacking international fame :(

=
내 마음속의 1위, 1위 할 수 있었는데 아쉽다, 이런건 다 이해하겠는데 이게 왜 1위; 이딴소린 좀 하지마라. 너네가수 대단했던거 인정하는데 팬들 인성이 영 별로네. 니네 인성 개나 준 건 혼자만 아시고, 다른 가수들 깎아내리면서 멀쩡한 가수, 팬들 욕먹이지 말고 적당히 하세요.
=
how many people agree with me that their stage presence is 💯💯
=
I got goose bumps when hearing every single second of this song
=
gurls literally slayin' this performance without any props or anything. just their mics and extraordinary talent
=
They seriously need a comeback with such a song
=
OH MY GOD THIS IS INCREDIBLE MAMAMOO DESERVED IT SO MUCH
=
Everytime Mamamoo is on stage, It feels like it's a Concert
=
No one can beat Mamamoo when its a singing competition like ♥️😍
=
I CAN'T LIE, THIS IS TOO LITT!!!!🔥
=
Damn just look at this amazing performance 🔥🔥🔥💗 I should thank this show beacuse they made me to be a big fan of mamamoo👏👏👏💞
=
cant wait for mamamoo will sing this song in MAMA 2019, it will be lit🔥 performance ever
=
3:00 yongsun i saw that 😂
=
Love the Vocals!
=
3:01 Solar almost fell there haha
=
I've listened to MAMAMOO since 2014 and every single performance they've done has given me the best goosebumps. Not many kpop groups can move me like MMM. They are humble and constantly improve their skills too. So happy and proud for MAMAMOO!
=
Omg this is so totally my war song! 🥰This is like my BGM whenever I run into my exes. I can already imagine 😂
=
Their vocals are amazing!
=
Good job Mamamoo! You gals deserve it! Can do live dance and sing at the same time! :D
=
Wheein's voice? Another level.
=
솔라 삐긋한거 시강ㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋ 왤케귀엽냐♥
=
I love how once they drop the final chorus(after interact with the public), the latatas are entirely by the public. Did anyone notice that?

Start and finish the show with Mamamoo was the best decision for Queendom.
=
Mamamoo ❤❤❤
=
I love these talented girls more than anything else and our beautiful fandom too
=
they say the talent of a group can truly be determined by the amount of same-gender fans they have. this is where mamamoo and big bang differ from their peers
=
I can't help but keep coming back to this performance. Mamamoo ily.
=
Whoa i know what the reason Mamamoo won, I got goosebumps when I watchinh this Video.

I'm watching again again again
=
뭔가 마니 없는 무대라고 생각하시겠지만 마마무의 보컬과 평소에 선보이지않았던 퍼포등으로 무대를 채운거보면 진짜 마마무하길 잘했다고 생각이 수천번도 드는것같다ㅠㅠ 관객한테 호응유도하는것도 그렇고 마마무라서 멋있었고 마마무라서 좋았던 무대인것같다. 무대를 찢었버리는것도 모잘라서 태워버렸다. 진짜 마마무가 마마무했다ㅠㅠ
=
솔라 넘어질뻔한거 나만봤냐 우래기ㅜㅜ 자꾸 어디 걸려요 왜ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 속상해ㅜㅜㅜ
=
They always make s stage like they own conser
=
다른팀 노래도 넘 좋지만 후렴이 약했고 멜로디가 초반이라우달라서 어설픈느낌이있었는데 역시 마마무.. 이래서 다들 마마무하는구나♥ 노래가 완성된느낌이다
=
아 미쳤냐고 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 소름끼쳐 ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 어떻게 이 4명이 그룹이 된거야 정말... 사랑해...마마무...........♡
=
뭐야 존나 멋있잖아

=
우린다시만날운명이엇지 이 부분 어디서 들어봣는데 ......힛츄윗뎃뚜루뚜루뚜 ?!
=
또 들으러 왔네욤ㅎㅎ 풀캠니 더 낫긴한데 얼굴보고 싶어서....ㅠㅠ화사 말처럼 마초적인 노래이긴 한데, 비장미도 넘치고 볼륨감있는 멜로디라 듣다보면 황야의 강인한 여인 말고도 석양을 배경으로 한 파도치는 바다에도 잘 어울릴 것 같음ㅎㅎ 상대남자가 바다 사나이인가...? 최소 외국인ㅋㅋㅋㅋ살아온 환경이 너무나 다른 남자를 만나 짧지만 뜨거운 사랑을 하고 쿨한 척 이별했지만 못 잊다가 훗날 다시 마주친 느낌!!
=
왜 죄다 영어람!
=
Everyone else: Does a comeback stage👍🏻
Mamamoo: Let's do a concert/award stage✌🏻
All stages were Lit but this was so different. No one does like our Queen👑
=
if Starry Night and Wind Flower had a baby: DESTINY!
=
Wheein is UNDER-RATED for sure
=
I...i...m speechless..no wonder Mamamoo is my ult bias group (queens)hwasa n solar at the end..my heartuuu..Congo 😘
=
떼창하고나서 휘인이 부르면서 끝날때 진짜 쾌감 오진다,,
=
Ignore those who said mamamoo dont deserve to win. If they really sane, even for a non fans you can see mamamoo talents is another level and various in terms of 'artist'
Mamamoo literally stand up alone  since before by their own talents from a nugu company, getting mistreat even fr a music show, media, and msnake especially. Its not all about popularity ( yes its one of it) but *SAY TO ME TALENT WISE WHO IS THE SAME PAR LIKE MAMAMOO*
LET US ARGUE face to face ~
If there is none, so stu
=
A rare Hwasa and solar moment too, love them so much, they r so cute

마마무 무대끝나고 곧바로 문투 종료하는건 어디서 배운건지.. 그 뒤에에 vcr있던데 그거 보고 종료하면 안되냐 진짜 뻥안치고 마마무 무대종료하고 1분도 안되어서 투표종료하더라 뭔.. 마마무가 표받는거 싫제  엠넷새퀴들
=
무대장치 연출 거창한퍼포먼스 이런 큰 거 없이 그냥 평소처럼 노래부르고 춤췄는데 존나 분위기 압도하네.. 넷의 적당한 몸짓과 미친 보컬 그리고 본래 가지고 있는 아티스트적 면모와 카리스마에 압살당했다.. 이런게 진짜 무대를 뿌순건가보다

Queen of Interaction 
da~ dadada! dadada! dadadada~ dadadadadada!!!
EVERYBODY DA DADADA 💕
=
The number one thing that made this stand out for me among the others was the fact that they engaged the audience in their performance. It's like they didn't perform just FOR the audience, they performed WITH them. And it must have been so exhilarating to see them live like that, with their vocal prowess and stage presence. Not that I'm saying the others were lacking at all, they were all so so soo amazing! But just because of this one thing that has always been unique with Mamamoo as a kpop group, who didn't always focus on giving a by-the-book performance, they stood out for me among the rest.
=
At 4.10 hwasa ‘no.. im not crying!’
=
Mamamoo: shakes the stage with their live vocals
Backtrack: am I a joke to you?
Moomoos:yes

그래도 마마무 최고
=
I thought lion deserve the win before watching this but this one is crazy too the vocal is just wow! Mamamoo never disappoint!
=
솔직히 퀸덤 무대들 다보고도 계속 돌려보는건 마마무 무대하고 아이들 무대이다 왜 마마무가 1위인지 알겠다ㅎ
=
진짜 몇 번을 봐도 개쩐다 마마무 사랑해 ㅠㅡㅠ..
=
This is, you all can tell them as "Respected Idol" by people, other fandom and other idols
=
팬덤빨 소리 작작해라
계속 그렇게 말해봤자 우리 팬덤 적어서 졌습니다요 ~~~한걸로밖에 안들림 ;;; 마마무는 정당하게 무무들이 열심히 음원점수내고 실력으로 당당하게 1등한거다
=
진짜, 그 어떤 걸그룹도 마마무를 이길 수 없다..👍👍
=
Who are you kidding this isn't even a performance.. its a story telling...talents overflowing
=
마마무 존나 후려치기 당하고 타팬들이 깎아내리고 있지만 누가 뭐래도 마마무가 1등이고 너무너무 수고했어요...
=
Good lord, I was wondering how g-idle didn't win this but now that I'm actually watching this performance... they blew my mind. I don't know them well (yet) but I definitely have to after this!  That main rapper is straight fire and all their voices are so angelic!
=
I’m so in love with the song 😍


Destiny makes me cry
Destiny makes me smile

I can wait forever 

It’s been a shining star
It’s been a blue sky
Gonna tell you something about my story
It’s been a long time
We’ve together through
Thick and thin and we won’t desert each other now


Such a meaningful lyrics ♥️
=
They might have simplest stage but the power each of them hold is incredible. Even theres 1000 dancers on stage 4 of them still stand out most.
In the end Mamamoo own the whole stage and the crowd.
=
OMG. I love their ending scene soooooo muchhhhhhh <3 They deserve to be the winner. yay!!!!!! <3

노래좋고 인물좋고 목소리좋고 의상 찰떡 지리게만드는 눈빛 환상적인 랩,보컬 퐌타스틱한 퍼포먼스 2프로 채워주는 백댄서 솔라,화사,휘인의 보컬 문스타의 랩 넘친는 끼 여유로운 무대 표정 피지컬 관객호응 무대매너 
그리고 가아아아ㅏ아아아아아아장 중요한 
솔라의 미모는 아무도 못따라간다
휘인의 노래실력은 우주 최강
화사의 퍼포먼스는 우주를 갈라버리고
문별의 랩은 진짜 말할것도 없다 걍 지림 알지..?!
마마무 오래가자~~~~~~
=
Im so proud of my babies ❤😭
=
THEY SURE AS HELL KNOW HOW TO PERFORM
=
I LOVE YOU MAMAMOO ❤❤

👉Philippines😏😊
=
Moonbyul: *smiles
me: *dies
=
I love when they performed all of them shined  together without covering other members
=
egotistic:iya..iya...iya!!
gogobebe:ela.ela.ela.ela??
destiny:ratatata..ratata!!
ME:mamamoo..mamamoo..mamam.o.o.o???
=
They are so beatiful with that new hair 😍
=
Lets just make it simple. Mamamoo is not just your typical idol. They are your SAVAGE ARTIST! Slaying a performance is their trademark! I became a fan 3 years ago with every performance they showcase.
=
I mean this is ART🔥🔥 THEY ARE MY QUEENS 😫😌🔥👑
=
Mamamoo OH MY GOD!!! If only i could hire them for my wedding. HOW I WISH
=
Well deserved win ❤️
=
What an amazing performance!
=
3:02 poor Solar😅.. i love Mamamoo
=
Mamamoo is my second fave gg , next to 2ne1. Glad they win, Bom also slayed. This show is full of talent and not just a soso kpop artists.
=
ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 지금 영상을 몇번째 돌려보는건지...
=
I love when momoos call their name ..
=
O B S E S S E D oh my gawd♥
=
Watch solar at 3:00 

It's alright, still a queen
=
4:10 Everytime also want to 送你基佬 🤣🤣
=
Goosebumps! !!
=
솔라화사 단발 휘인 염색
별이 멋짐이 날 미치게 만든다 진짜
=
좀 그만 좀 하실래요? 퀸덤 집계방식(사전경연, 음원점수,문자투표) 따른 결과이며 모든 걸그룹 다 무대에 최선을 다해 참여했습니다. 제발 그만 악플 다세요. 알비답이라는 일 못하는 회사때문에 말도 안되는 국내외 행사며 콘서트 일정까지 병행하며 아픈 멤버 이끌고 멋진 무대 만든 아티스트에게 비난하지 마세요. 어느 팬덤이라고 말하지 않겠지만 맘에 들지 않으시면 쓰루하세요. 악플을 달게 아니라 지나가시라고요.  Plz do not mention other group, Stop hate comments.
=
암넷의 발캠도 커버하는 울 언니들 실력ㄷㄷㄷㄷ
=
3:00 solar slipped
=
실력엄청좋고!휘인이언니머리넘잘어울려요ㅠㅠ문별이언니랩파트넘좋아요!!노래너무좋다 근데.....엠넷은어딜찍는거죠...역시믿듣맘무!!! 솔라언니핑크머리잘어울려요!다의상이넘잘어울린다....
=
my goddesses!
=
진짜 회사가 돈이 부족해도 실력으로 다 커버친다...목소리로 무대가 꽉차ㅠㅠ
=
역시 마마무인가
=
3:02 솔라 그 와중에 혼자 넘어질 뻔 하는  거ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 언니 괜찮아요,,,,,,??
=
Wheein you did it. From bias wrecker to my official  bias now....♥️
=
문별 부분 너무좋드
=
3:00도 그렇고 굿럭때도 그렇고 솔라 자꾸 접지르는것 같은데 낮은 굽으로 신기면 안되냐ㅠㅠ
=
Oh hwasa cut her long hair.😳 😍
=
I need the full full audio to this (mostly meaning the “I can’t wait forever part.”)
=
They dont even need an extravagant props to make a cool stage performance. Their voice and stage presence are already enough to make the crowd go ratatatat!
=
My Queen 😍😍
=
다 마마무 그냥 평범하다,평소다,별로다 하는데 나만 진짜 잘한다고 느껴지나??
=
뜬금없지만 방금 2019년도 띵곡모음을 듣고와서 그런지 감셩이 폭발해서 이거를 내가 다 늙었을 때 다시 볼 생각을 하니 왠지 이상하다
=
역시 믿고 보는 맘무
=
when byul put her foot on the dancers... i felt that.
=
wow its different seeing hwasa and solar with that short hair
=
Their song the best among the rest
=
wow, the vocals
=
문스타 걸크러쉬다
=
Keren banget ini mah, walaupun bukam fans tp klo ada lagu2 mammamo pasti tertarik denger atau nonton
=
Mamamoo never disappointed!! Mamamoo nunca decepciona, orgullosa de ser una imomo vamos por ese nuevo regreso y álbum!!!
=
Wow just wow
=
This melody like starry night.. I like both song.. Good mamamooo
=
댄스동작이 안큰데도 감각적이네요~~구뜨~~~
=
양보해주며 평화를 지키던 여왕님이 왕관을 쓰고 망토를 펄럭였다~!!!!!!!!
=
I’m loving their stage presence .
And can we talk about the short hair girl’s STANK facial expressions? So powerful !!!!
I’m a blackjack but damnnnn this was littttt
=
THAT AUDIENCE INTERACTION PART WILL ALWAYS SEND ME ITS INCREDIBLE U GUYS
=
As you can see, only Mamamoo can always do this people participation in every performance. It's like a concert when you see them perform.
=
바닷가에서 만난 인어한테 처음듣는언어로 옛날얘기 듣는거같은 기분이야 이거 무슨느낌이래? 우와소리만 나옴;;
=
Honestly, I was skeptical when they announced they'll join this competition because Queens don't need to prove themselves anymore but I realized them conquering this show is a blessing so people who are not familiar to them will know who are the real queens of Kpop. I'm not hating on other groups but we all know Mamamoo deserves more recognition being a vocal powerhouse and legit performers since day one. Spread your Queendom Mamamoo!
=
Everything about this performance is on point: vocals, rap, choreo, expressions, visuals, and as always, they let the audience be involved on the performance. I love everyone that competed in Queendom, but let's not be blinded by our fandom and talk negatively about the winners. We all know Mamamoo delivered a winning performance. And everyone gave such great performances!
=
왜 솔라 칭찬이 이렇게 없죠ㅠㅠ 분위기 진짜 오지는데...
화사 립스틱... 저런 색 어울리는 사람 처음봤어요ㅠ
휘인 머리색 음색ㅠㅠ
문벌 랩 할 때는... 말이  필요 없다ㅠㅠ
이번 무대 진짜 레전드♥
=
Just saw someone say mamamoo won because they're popular... does anyone know how popularity works??? Especially in an industry?? Its no surprise that they'd win considering they have all the assets required to stand out on stage. Vocals, stage presence, charisma, a good understanding of what engages an audience. Great music, that first and foremost, MOVES the listener. It's ironic people would pull the "popularity over talent card" considering they didnt even accumulate the most views on queendom! Just face it. They deserve the win. They proved themselves. Anyone who says otherwise and tries to discredit their accomplishments, is, for lack of a better word, salty.
=
The ending. The way they really ended the show in the most fun way by involving the audience and then... THAT FINAL POSE. 

Mamamoo truly legendary
=
who else are going back here again, and waiting patiently for the mv of this song?🙋
=
문별언니... 너무 잘생기고 이뿐고 아니냐...ㅜㅜㅜ 사랑해 화사 단발 진짜 섹도다 진짜 솔라눈 걍 여신이고 휘인은 뭘해도 기어유ㅓㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 사랑해 진따 ㅠㅠㅠ 1등 츅하해 마맘무 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
아니짐시만 일단 노래가 너무 넘사로좋잖아 완전 갓띵곡이잖아~~!~!!
그리고 파트마다 미쳐버림 진짜 천재들이냐고요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ화사 도입부 솔라 천녀강림 휘인음색으로 죠지고 문별이 총같이쓴 랩에 맞아죽어버림
이건..너무..너무야....무무야..!!!!!
=
Not a fan but this is definitely stage of the deserving winner 👍
=
my fav part is 1:42
=
I know everyone is saying this in the comments but I can't stop myself from commenting this...







NO ONE CAN DO IT LIKE MAMAMOO.THEY ARE ICONIC QUEENS.THEY ARE ARTISTS AND NOT JUST IDOLS.END OF DISCUSSION.
=
It is shocking how similar aoa and mamamoo concepts and song are but both groups portray the concept differently in their own unique way
=
1위는 결국 다시 만날 운명이었지...
=
제발 얼굴만 찍지말고 전체 안무부분을 찍어주세요 이번 안무가 엄청 멋있었는데 본방에서는 하나도 안담겨있고 너무 복잡합니다 그리고 대체 멀리서는 왜 찍는겁니까
=
No one:
Definitely no one:
Not even a single soul:



Absolutely no one: can do it like MAMAMOO QUEENS
=
도입부 화사음색이 다했다..... 진짜 독보적이야ㅠㅠㅠ 너무좋음....
=
사랑해요
=
한국인을 찾아라!! (두둥!)
=
얘들은 회사에서 돈좀쓰면 좋을텐데. 앨범나올때 보면 뮤비나 의상이나 무튼 회사가 돈을 잘안쓰는느낌 .
=
노래좋네
=
와 진짜 컴백 곧 하는구나ㅠ 많이 기다렸구 바뀐 머리 스타일도 진짜 다 찰떡이다 퀸덤 하면서 수고 너무 많았고 놓지않을게❤️❤️❤️🤟🏻
=
The song is BEAUTIFUL
=
깎아 내려봐야 팬덤은 어쨋든 마마무 실력으로 쌓아올린거고 느그돌들 팬덤 작다는거 반증하는거지 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 느그돌들 라이브개병맛인데 마마무는 라이브 최강~ 니들이 뭐라던 마마무 실력이고 팬들 안없어져~ 마마무 사랑해 ㅠㅠ
=
💜
=
they WON even when mnet tried to be a snake and closed voting 3 minutes after their performance - if anything, this only shows the power of moomoos!!!
=
did anyone notice solar trippin? @ 3:01 lol queen
=
.,ahhh!for 100x that ived watch this,.gotcha solarsido,.from 3:02-3:05,.yungson unnie forever,.nevertheless  amazing performance!!
=
My queen really slayyyyyyyyyyyy so bad in this song 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
=
#이다희 가 왜있는지 아시는분?
=
*04:38** 엔딩 개멋있다 진짜*
=
The ending pose should be kept in the museum. EPIC.
=
Mamamoo deserved the win.
Reason being, the other songs are really good, but this song is more of an emotion. Or maybe, Mamamoo makes this song an emotion.
=
아이들팬인데 마마무분들 노래듣고 너무 좋아서 무대도 보러왔습니다 ㅜㅡㅠㅠ 다들 너무 멋있으세요;) 늘 좋은 음악과 무대해주셔서 무무는 아니지만 응원하고있어요! 앞으로의 행보도 응원하겠습니다!

+ 댓글창에 퀸덤참여한 그룹팬덤도 아닌데 마마무분들 욕하고다니는 어그로들 있는거 같아서 신고했습니다! 무무분들 예쁜댓글만 보시면 좋겠어서..
=
*"MAMAMOO never gave out bad performance"*

It's not a compliment


*IT'S A FACT*
=
I used to love Blackpink a LOT, but now Mamamoo have been my favourite GG. Congratulations queens.
=
Mamamoo came from a small company. On their debut day only family & friends came to cheer for them coz they have no fans that times. Their path was not easy, struggling to be recognised, being compared of standard beauty with other GG idol & being an artist with a different music approach was not an easy, but they never give up! They climb up slowly step by step with blood, sweat & tears.

 Now, the world recognise them as a Queen 👑. Thank you so much to Kmoomoos coz always support them, cheer loudly for them till they have an international MooMoos.

Please don't hate them because they won Queendom, they really deserve it! Your Idol & Mamamoo are friends now. They like & love each other. Don't waste your time with meaningless fan war. Peace ✌️ 💞
=
Can’t believe Mamamoo invented *c h a r i s m a* 😨
=
As a massive moomoo, I'll be honest, some of their recent songs haven't captured my attention as much as the old stuff, although their songs certainly haven't gotten bad by any means. But this song... Has really captured my attention. This is exactly the kind of song I've been waiting to hear from them. It's classy, it's fun, it's clever, and it's most certainly exciting. The song feels like one massive buildup, as even the chorus doesn't relieve the tension. If anything, the chorus accelerates the song and drives it forward at an even greater speed. But when the bridge came... Wow. I mean that has to be the most well-earned and satisfying explosion of sound I've heard from K-pop in a while. 

So many K-Pop girl groups these days have badass, powerful concepts with loud but tasteless drops in the chorus. Mamamoo, as per usual, stick out from the crowd and takes the road less traveled. This has to be their most powerful deviation yet. Truly, I'm stunned, and I can't wait to see what other kinds of energy they're going to bring to their new album coming mid-November. Great job girls!
=
They deserved 100% to win, I'm so proud they've improved themselves a lot. Now support Mamamoo because they're having a big comeback soon.
=
everybody knows that mamamoo is the best k-girl group that ever existed, their outstanding vocals, all of them kills others 😘
=
Did anyone else notice that Solar tripped in 3:02
=
Hwasa's short hair still kills me ugh😍🤤 They're not just idols, they are artists.
=
DAMN STAGE PRESENCE & CHARISMA MAMAMOO HOLDS. EACH MEMBER GOT DIFFERENT COLOR TO SHOW BUT TOGETHER THEY CREATE SUCH BEAUTIFUL HUE. THEY CAN DEVOUR THE STAGE SO PERFECTLY.
=
I was having a hard time deciding who I wanted to win between OMG (I'm a miracle) or AOA's comeback which I loved but, this song is amazing and the performance was so good.
OH MY GIRL will be forever my Queens and that's never going to change. But MAMAMOO is definitely royalty.
=
MAMAMOO comeback with their 2nd full album 'reality in BLACK' 14th November 2019 6PM KST, look forward to it :)
=
They even make me forget about other presentations. I mean they just closed with gold brooch.
=
THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY LEGENDARY!!!! WHAT MAMAMOO DID IN THIS FINAL IS WHAT THEY CALL ICONIC
=
Them: Who is your bias?

Me: Mamamoo 

(Deym I LOVE THEIR EXPRESSION, MOVEMEBTS, VOCALS, STAGE PRESENCE. I JUST EFFIN LOVE THEIR EXISTENCE. Deym Mamamoo, you never fail to amazed us)
=
Congrats on the win Queens
=
MAMAMOO is making a comeback very soon with their 2nd full album 'reality in BLACK' on 14th November 2019.
=
I cant believe this is perfect song...
I start cry
=
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS ALTHROUGHOUT THEIR PERF OHMYGOD
=
mamamoo officially the queen of kpop and is running the show
=
What a performance 😭❣️
=
At the end of the day even if your choreography is the bomb, a song is meant to be sung. And oh gurl, can MAMAMOO SING! Their vocals are drop dead gorgeous and the power and energy they exude is beyond anything. Love them so much! 


Also: this song is everything!
=
WHEEIN I LOVE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU <3
=
WAIT WTF NO ONE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS
=
I became mamamoo’s fan when i watch egotistic.. and at queendom i’m so proud with that☺️☺️☺️❤️❤️❤️
=
Their stylist does a really good job of making each of their outfits unique to their personality without making one member stand out from the other. They look like a team rather than having one member stand out, having all in completely different outfits, or having them all in extremely similar outfits.
=
3:02 omg Solar ㅠㅠ
=
OMG Hwasa's short hair!!!!
=
Every performance looks like a concert
=
Absolute GODDESSES 👑
=
Just noticed yeba tripped again lol are you okay solar 💕
=
Short hair suits Hwasa the best ❤️
=
Maravilhosas!
=
Best performance and song <333
=
다 엄청 잘하지만 문별님 랩에 찰떡인듯ㅠㅠ
=
when solar almost trips and fall at 3:00 but she walks it off and shows everyone who’s queen 👑 and that she’s here to win 🔥
=
Will we have a MV for this perfect song ?
=
YAAASS COWBOY CONCEPT
=
didn't even see solar trip at 3:01, wheein's voice was too mesmerizing
=
Now that's a wrap... What a legendary performance.. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌👌👌
=
Well deserved win, honestly the effort put behind this song shows. I got goosbumpssss
=
AMAZING!!!
=
💙👑 Long life to the QUEENS 👑💙
=
노래 너무 좋다 파워풀하고 음색예쁘고 믿드맘무 역시다
=
WHAT!!!!  
Chills
AMAZING!!!!!
=
Queens❤
=
Was watching this when my friend came up to me and ask.. so which of these girls is your favorite? 
Me: (when Hwasa touches her hat) her! 
Me: (when Solar walks out) her! 
Me: (when Wheein sang the first word) her!
Me: (when Moonbyul starts rapping) her!
Friend: there can be only one favourite..... 
Me: *ignores*
=
감성도 좋고 퍼포먼스도 좋고 전개도 좋고.. 곡도 좋지만 정말 좋은 무대에요!
=
Who has joined the Mamamoo cult?
=
this was one of the most amazing performances i've ever seen holy shit
=
moonbyul ❤
=
Reinas 💖
=
Queens yes or yes??
=
Want high quality performance? Mamamoo got you covered.
=
Please, mv
=
Algo que decir... Mis reinas 👑 si ellas son mis reinas MAMAMOO 👑💖
=
SHORT HAIR HWASA IS BACK!
=
이 곡으로 활동하나요? 마마무 노래 중에 최고 좋아요
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
영상으로는 아이들꺼 게속 보게 되는데 노래는 마마무 노래 따라부르게되네 .. 
문별언니 랩 너무 좋다ㅜㅜ
=
Okay but Hwasa in dark lips wearing all white is my aesthetic
=
WOOOOOOW
=
why aren't mamamoo and g-idle more popular, they are the next generation groups with actual charisma and concept
=
I smile coz I know loco is
=
I smile coz I know loco is

This looks like a freaking stage that could be in Coachella ❤️❤️❤️

마마무가 작정하고 칼군무까지하면 이런 무대가 만들어집니다 ㅇ<-<

1위 진짜 너무 축하해요 고생 많았어요ㅠㅠㅠ
1위 불리기 전에 심장 터질 거 같았는데
1위 마마무 이름 불리고 침대 부시면서 발작하다가 펑펑 울었어요 진짜ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
1위 가수 우리 마마무 너무 축하해요 사랑해 항상 뒤에서 응원할게요 언제나
=
이번곡 문별파트 진짜 너무 좋다.. ㅠㅠㅠㅜ 이 언니들 진짜 너무 멋있어 영화 한편 다 봤다
=
도입부부터 끝까지 소름의 연속이었다 진짜 ㅜㅜ 이건 마마무라서 살릴 수 있었던 것 같음 ... 원래 아이돌들과는 다르게 노래도 파워풀하게 불러서 더 좋았던 것 같고 1위할 수 있었던 것 같음.. 결국은 마마무 짱 ...♥️
=
I hope they perform this song at MAMA2019🤩
=
되게 무슨 드라마 OST 같아 노래 듣는데 서사가 그려져 ;;;;;
=
진짜 마마무 무대 제일 좋았는데 6팀중에 카메라 무빙 제일 답 없었음;; 포인트 다 놓치고 댄서 잡고 난리도 아니야
=
they criticize mamamoo just bc their favorites didnt win .. negativity at its finest ..
=
To those who are saying that MAMAMOO did not deserve their victory, and that their idols were robbed, READ THIS

ALL GROUPS ARE DESERVING TO WIN. THE MOMENT THEY WERE INVITED TO COMPETE IN THE SHOW MEANS THAT THEY ARE WORTHY. SO STOP BEING IMMATURE DRAGGING OTHER IDOLS DOWN JUST TO UPLIFT YOUR STANS CAUSE IT WON'T DO ANYTHING GOOD.

To defend my ladies (MAMAMOO), they are deserving like any other group. First of all, they worked hard. They were be able to get a strong fanbase and to capture the hearts of many because they chose to be different, artistic, and they really love music. They are destined to be a performer. THEY PRODUCE THEIR OWN SONGS. THEY WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS. For some that are not satisfied by them, who thinks they don't do complex choreos and do not sound like other trendy k-pop songs, well, that's MAMAMOO. They don't follow anyone's standard so get over it.

If you do not like their musicality or maybe because it's simply too much to handle, I understand BUT dragging them down and saying that they're not talented and undeserving is UNACCEPTABLE.

Yes, they got the least to gain from this show but THE SHOW IS NOT ABOUT WHO "NEEDS" TO WIN.

All groups are very lucky to be able to show their true colors and to highlight themselves, and all of us should appreciate this wonderful chance to be able to witness these.

Our idols are very grateful for this kind of oppurtunity. I am sure that for them, winning is only a bonus achievement, what they truly got from this show is FRIENDSHIP and IMPROVEMENT.

SO STOP THE FANWARS PLEASE
=
아 진짜 너무 축하해요ㅠㅠㅠ본방 보면서 마음 엄청 졸이면서 맘무 우승하게 해달라고 빌고 손이랑 발에 땀나고 흑으으륵ㄱ아ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ맘무 우승 나오자마자 으아아아ㅏㅇㄱ거리면서 주저앉았어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ언니들 울때 저도 흐어어엉ㅇㄹ거리면서 울고...진짜 너무 축하하고 고생많았어요 이번 무대 다들 너무 예쁘고 걸크쩔고 멋지고 여유넘치고 노래도 좋고 다 완벽했어요 컴백쇼도 너무 무리하게 준비하지말고 언니들 몸 우선으로 해서 준비해줘요 진짜 축하하고 너무 사랑해요❤

wtf did she cut her hair already?
=
마마무는 볼때마다 느끼는건데 정말 합이 좋다
다 잘한다  서로를 빛나게 해주는것 같다

와씨 이건 미쳤다 마마무 최최최레전드야진짜..대박 완전 멋있어
=
Lol the dance move is simple looking but rythmic and den when u actually tried u will pant like crazy and den also look like shit
=
I love how the crowd goes wild for them, Queens indeed.
=
They are the real Queens
=
They slapped me with the visuals then stomped me with the vocals. 


I just wanted to eat my bagel.
=
Whoa😍😍😍

*Imagine this performance at MAMA 2019! I'm already getting goosebumps!!*

약간 분위기가 몽환적이면서,신나서 더 중독성있는 듯.....

No wonder they won. They’re another lvl
=
역시퀸마마무믿고보는마마무
=
💞💕💕💕 their interaction w the audience, their vocals are so stable
=
What that you need for a good performance it's not just a good property but it's about a good song, good vocal, and you must good in delivery that song.. And that's what Mamamoo need.. They are just need MIC for fight in this competition.. Well done girls..
=
미쳣다 진짜 이무대는ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
다른가수들도 잘햇는데

waaahhhhhhh
=
여긴 경연장이지 콘서트장이 아녀.. 맨날 헷갈리는거 같은데 경연하는거야.. 콘서트 하는게 아니라구..😂
=
If Hwasa's short hair won't kill me, Wheein's charisma will surely be the final blow.
=
무대가 화려하지 않아도 1등한다는 걸 보여줌 이번 노래도 개좋고 다 너무 이쁨 진짜 1등 할만했음 노래실력부터가 걍 미침
근데 제발 회사에서 돈 좀 써줬으면 ;;;
받아 처먹는게 있으면 제발 돈 좀 써라 ;;
장난하나 ,,,
=
Destiny and My Star need to be performed at awards show
=
I showed all the performances to my mom without her knowing my bias group (she did know I have a soft spot for bom though) and she said after watching all the performances Mamamoo was what impressed her the most. (G)-Idle was a close second for her but she said that while they had a wonderful performance she felt Mamamoo's killing parts, stage presence, engagement with the crowd and full focus on the song is what made them win. All the teams did amazing but Mamamoo's win was well earned ❤️
=
Ohhhhh, this is a competition...

I thought it was their concert...

THEY SLAP HARD
=
They were constant throughout the whole show while every other group were on and off and they tried their best and still there stages was amazing. Remember when they had a concert the day before they performed? Wheein was not in the best condition but she still rocked it. Korea voted for them. They had the best digital sales. They won her over it
=
I think this was their best stage in Queendom, and they deserve #1.
=
The other groups’ performances were also really good, but the deciding factor for me is the fact that mamamoo interacted with the audience!
=
I'm so proud seeing these queens slaying stages and doing what they were destined to do! 💜
=
HELP—
my brain: Destiny makes me cry

HELP M—
my brain: RATATATATATATATATTAATATATATATARATATATAT
=
Msnake, now tell me who is your MAMA? 
BISH
=
Absolutely love this blend of different concepts! Anything MAMAMOO does, they smash it! TRUE ARTISTS WITH VOCALS, STYLE, PRESENCE, MUSICALITY, AND LOVE FOR FANS 🥺💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
=
이건 솔직히 언니들 1등 안할수 없잖아 언니들 너무 이쁘고...
글고 마마무 계속 2등해서 '왜 계속 2등만 하지?' 하고 계속 생각을 했는데 좀 속 시원하고 회사가 언니들 투자를 해줬슴 좋겠는데..
결론:언니들 사랑해요♡짱!
=
they just know how to include the audience perfectly
=
The cowboy motifs are everywhere and I'm living for it
=
THEYRE THE BEST IN LIVE
=
4:26 love this music part

Put aside Mamamoo's huge fan base, this performance alone really killed & shot my heart, my wig & everything. Bom's performance was also great because of it's raw emotions
=
This gives me starry night vibes and gOd I am loving it
=
3:00 focus on solar, she almost tripped again🌝
=
그냥 마마무 최고야ㅠㅠㅠㅠ문별언니 너무 멋있고 솔라언니 너무 이쁘고 화사언니 너무 최고고 휘인언니 노래너무 잘불러ㅠㅠ
=
My QUEENS😍😍😍
=
THEY FREAKIN WON 🥺😍
=
Am I the only one who can't stop looking at wheein ??😭
=
헉... ㅠㅠ 노래 넘 좋앜 ㅠㅠ
=
Atlast! I've been waiting for this!!!!
=
4:09 maybe I melted a lil bit
=
진짜 멋있어
=
Omg i love them... oh my wheein i love her she looks gorgeus
=
마마무 진짜 대단해
=
문별 랩 파트 너무 좋은데;;;
=
화사의 특유의 표정 너무 좋아ㅠ
=
Ok come to realize I prefer Hwasa and Solar with long hair and Moonbyul and Wheein with short hair but both pairs are opposite of each other 😂
=
I live for the final pose!
=
4:31 너무웃김 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
This is giving me a new version of starry night
=
휘인 set you free할때 음색 대박....
=
이거 중독성 댑악...
=
Wow!!!! Love this! Love them! 😍
=
나는 보통 무대 영상이나 무비를 끝까지 안 보는데....좋아하는 사람이라도...근데 이건 그냥 넋 놓고 끝까지 봤다
=
From a completely external perspective (regardless of the competition or favored groups), this song was awesome and caught my attention.
=
soliotoiiii <3
=
Meu deus do ceu, que performance perfeita 💜❤️💜 rainhas
=
You know how in every performance, audience impact is a very important component right? Mamamoo is doing it right by making people part of the performance by hyping them up. Not only are they serving talentry and slayage, but they also made people feel the connection with them as well.

Good music + Good performance + stage presence + connection to the audience = victory.

Congratulations to Mamamoo for winning Queendom! Well deserved victory!

For the other groups as well, congratulations for doing so well.

At this point I’m just happy that everyone is getting the recognition that they deserve with this show. Everyone was scared, but here we are with our ggs being close because of this.
=
I NEED M/V ASAP !
=
마마무는 역시마마무   실망이않되   최고♡♡♡
=
petition for this to be the song mamamoo performs at mamas
=
Queens of perform, no doubt. Congratulation queens.
=

=
휘인언니 갈수록 리즈갱신이다❤
=

=
프로다
=
ムンビョルさんwカッコエエw
=
Their perfoming like a concert👍👍👍
=
Mamamoo is another girl group besides Dreamcatcher where i cant.choose a bias..Solar's high notes,Hwasa and Wheein the powerful duo i never knew i desperately needed,and Byul's raps..Everything is..just perfect
=
This is a concert
=
매우 아름다운
=
Mamamoo love you

Mis bebés tan bonitas, tan talentosas. INCENDIAN ESCENARIOS CON SU ENERGÍA Y PODER! AAAHHH LAS AMO ♥

=
Wow awesome song!!
=
Wheein and hwasa’s harmony 🥺
=
💕💕
=
솔직히 퀸덤 하는중에도 맨날 행사에 시상식에 거기다가 솔로준비까지 힘들었을텐데 항상 최고의 무대를 보여줘서 고마울 뿐 ㅜㅜ
=
Mamamoo is seriously amazing, another level of idol to be honest
And ps: anyone else saw Solar tripping on stage at 3:02 haha
=
TRULY THE QUEENS
=
The ratata part on 3:55 was the best
The energy, the hype, the connection, the unity of all fandoms in the audience
Truly outstanding
=
My vocals queen👑💙
=
1:12
=
솔직히 마마무 좋아하는데 처음 노래듣고 "엥.....? 난 좋은지 모르겠다 왔다갔다하는 느낌이야..."했는데 무대보니까 ㄹㅇ띵곡이 나왔네 역시 믿듣맘무
=
화사는 진짜 스타성 대단하다...
=
역시..믿고 듣는 마마무 정말 간절히 1등하길 바랬어요 .. 무무는 아니지만 어느순간 팬이 되어버렸네요 항상 응원합니다 역!시! 마마무
=
MAMAMOO is coming back at November 14th please support them

#Bless_Life_And_Carry_Knowledge 🖤
=
이번 무대 솔직히 맘무가 할 수 있는건 최대한의 노력으로 다 한거에요 ㅜㅠㅠ 근데 소속사가 뒤를 안밀어준거지... 하다못해 무대라도 웅장하게 꾸며주고 그게 힘들면 의상이나 소품 같은 거라도 더 화려하게 해줬으면 무대 퀄도 훨씬 올라가고 좋았을텐데... 제발 알비덥아 맘무가 니네 돈 벌어다주는 기계 아니에요 이미 벌어다 줄 만큼 벌어다줬고 니네 소속사 맘무가 가장이나 마찬가지인데 돈 좀 제대로 쓰세요 제발 ㅠ 애초에 소속사가 3대처럼 강했으면 이 프로 나오지도 않았겠지만...ㅠ
=
아니 그냥 다 1등 주면 안되요 엠넷?ㅠㅠㅜ 모든 무대가 미쳤구만 우열을 어케 가려
=
I’m stuck with that ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ra ta ta ta ta ta ta ta
=
약간 캠이 네명이 다 보이거나 그랬으면 좋겠다 하는 부분들 되게 많았는데 계속 잘리고 그래서 캠 아쉽..풀캠 존버..
=
이번곡은 문별파트가 제일 좋았던것같음
=
Destiny makes me cry
Destiny makes me smile

This was my fav part 😍
=
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
=
"I don't need to perform 4th in order to win" - mamamoo 2k19 

(Context: 
1. G-Idle performed 4th for Latata and was ranked 1st for the mission
2. Oh My Girl, as a group, performed 4th for both Destiny and Twilight and was ranked 1st for 2 consecutive missions, dethroning G-Idle
3. Oh My Girl placed Mamamoo as the last performing act for the final mission when deciding the order of performers
4. Mamamoo was able to change when they were going to perform (could've performed 1st since they performed 1st for Decalcomanie and Good Luck or could've performed 4th due to the 'good luck charm' for performing 4th - they won the mini challenge for shaking off sticky notes
5. Mamamoo sticks with Oh My Girl's original order and will be performing last; thus, not using the reward) 

mamamoo is the only group that's able to destroy the good luck charm.
=
이게 무슨 무대냐 콘서트지
=
Mamamoo making this show as their concert 😂 this is not fair lmao
=
Am I the only one who noticed that solar almost fall in her face? she's so cute!
=
과하지도 않고 멋짐 화사한테 빠져든다
=
May Hwasa’s long hair rest in peace :,(((
=
목소리 진짜좋다 퀸덤 다 봤지만 역시 음색은 마마무가 촤고인거같다
=
I'm an international fan, I first encountered Mamamoo because of Park Bom's song which featured Wheein, that is then when I got curious about her and found out about Mamamoo. 
In that very simple statement, what you actually don't see, is that Mamamoo, is not actually (much) "KNOWN" internationally. This is for those telling me that Mamamoo is not underrated. Yes, they might not be underrated in SK, but tbh in my country, whose people are engaging massively in Kpop industry, most of them don't even know Mamamoo. 
Sad truth, millions of views count, it does count, it's a huge part of what sells nowadays, its considered a great portion of what it is to be deemed "KNOWN". You cannot reason out that people don't have time to stream because that's not how it works. Today, it is what the industry is about, attracting people, consumers, ones who'll buy the albums, stream on chart sites, etc..thus it is vital for all artists and idols. These shows are good for PR, but is it enough? Yes, being looked up by the other contestants is good, but is that enough to say that a group is not underrated? Will that change their international branding? NO. 
And I know Mamamoo themselves told us moomoos to be calm, and be happy for all their achievements, but I will never stop saying they are "UNDERRATED" like it's a sin to actually realize what's really happening right now, until they get vastly recognized. I will not swallow my pride and settle for this, I will not be ignorant, for I know in my heart, MAMAMOO DESERVES MORE. They deserve ALL the great things, they deserve to be more recognized in South Korea, and moreover internationally, with their huge amount of talent they even deserve it more than other/some well known groups, who relies mostly on popularity. 
I know it is because RBW isn't capable of promoting them properly, but these girls have been working so hard for years, they started from scratch, paved their way, it's all taking time but I hope it will all immensely pay off someday. 
If only I have a huge amount of riches, I will promote them so hard it will b*tch slap all those haters and bashers. Haha. Kidding aside. 😂 I will promote them so much that the world will get a chance to see how wonderful and marvelous they truly are. But for now, I will never stop supporting and defending them every way in their journey.
=
매 무대마다 이렇게 멋지면 무무들 심장이 남아나질 않잖소
=
라이브만 가능한 관객호흥유도..존멋..역시 MMM
=
와 진짜 마마무 천재만 모였다...문별아 사랑해 심장아프다,.
=
굳이 여기까지 와서 다른애들이 1등이엇어야햇다고 하는 이유는 ?ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Good performance, every person has their own talent.
=
누가 마마무 춤 안춘다 했냐?
=
뭐야 문별 개멋있어 심장 아파
=
마지막에 혜진이가 솔라 안을때 미쳤다고ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜ
=
Vote this VOCAL QUEENS in MAMA 2019 THEY DESERVE IT they deserved being first place in queendom

Props? Nahh, MMM got this covered.
They served us vocals, and talent, and charisma, and audience involvement. Ugh, MMM signature.
=
와,,,화사 단발 엄청잘어울린다,,,,;;진짜 너무 멋져ㅠㅠ
=
요즘 걸그룹은 인원수가 7명이상이던데 마마무는 4명인데도 무대가 작게 느껴져 멋있어
=
I’m a giant oh my girl fan but I knew mamamoo was going to win. Tbh I thought mamamoo deserved it just as much if not more. I’m really proud!
=
I love Hwasa's short hair!!
=

=
They always make me cry with their performance. Waaaaaa 😭😭😭 This is soo good
=
1:13 Goosebumps when Wheein's part came up 😍😍
=
QUEENS 🤘🏻
=
무대는 너무 구성 좋은데 의상이 너무 찰랑거리는 거라서 춤선이 하나도 안 보이고 카메라 워킹 멀리서 할 땐 진짜 하나도 안 보임
=
I know why mamamoo deserve they win! This performance is really neomu wanjon daebak GREAT! And they sing it live beautifully! I just see the other performance too, they do their great performance too, BUT MAMAMOO IS DIFERENT! THEY REALLY DESERVE WIN!

3:00 Oopsies solar, hope she didn't hurt herself
=
걍 믿듣 맘무♥
=
Wow! Love it! Amazing! Already colored blue. Stay connected.
=
The only thing is that if they’re actually wearing wing all together it would be looking so coooll like white and black wing . #mamawing #mama #mamamoo
=
Moonbyul oppa!!! Hahahaha
=
와.........진심감동
=
can't believe hwasa cut her hair 😍😍😍😍😍 QUEEEEENNNNSSS
=
As a Neverland, I totaly agree that Mamamoo are the Queens 👏😍❤💜💙
=
wowwww their vocal
=
화사 카리스마
=
professionalism is once again defined by solar at 2:59
=
Look at my CHARMING PRINCE!!!!!
=
어떤 사람은 퀸덤 최종회보고 인기투표라고 하는데 ㅜ 인기투표가 될수있다는건 인정하지만 솔직히 이번 마마무 노래 너무 중독성도 좋고 라타타처럼 관객도 참여할수있는 면을 고려한거 너무 좋았던거 같다 ㅠㅠ
=
I love this fandom
=
Solar got trip at 3:02
=
3:01
=
Goosebump
=
Congratulations to Mamamoo!! putting competition aside, QUEENDOM is a celebration of K-pop girl groups!! I couldn't pick a winner. I'm glad that these hardworking and talented girls are getting more recognition through this show.  Let's be kind and be more supportive towards girlgroups. They are the ones who faced criticism and get bashed the most. I think they deserved the attention and love as much as K-pop boys!!!
=
Stylist: How much tassels do you want?
Mamamoo: YES

OMG QUEENS SNAPPED 💕
=
와 장난없다 마마무한테 빠졌어
=
Other fandom really be hating on MMM for winning when they themselves were lazy to stream the song 😑 like dude, mamamoo literally topped the chart
=
HAVE YOU GUYS NOTICED SOLAR LOW NOTE & HWASA HIGH NOTE TOGETHER?????
=
They did all the stages with their best, they destined to go more popular and hot!!!!
=
진짜 마마무는 자꾸 무대를 찢다못해 박살낸다
=
솔라첨에 남자둘한테 들려오다 내려져서 노래부르는거 나만웃기냐?? ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
The art of this song, up, down, slow, fast, emotion, energetic, roller coaster, all in one.
=
WTFF????!!!! THEY ARE DANCING! AND THOSE VOCAL WAS ON POINT!! STAGE PRESENCE IS UNDOUBTEDLY LIT!! A QUEEN!
=
Wheein “set you free” gave chills
=
When did the moomoo memorize the fanchant?
=
this performance proves that, simplicity is better than, too much.

and no matter what happens. queens are queens.
=
Mamamoo SLAY
=
솔라 눕혀져서 들어오는거 겁나 귀여웤ㅋㅋㅋ
=
With this performance, you know they deserve to be #1. All 6 songs are so special in their own ways, I can't tell which I prefer, but the performance of Mamamoo outdid the others 1 step. The way they cooperated with the audience decided their victory. It reminds me of Bohemian Rhapsody, the scene in which the band communicates with the fans as one.
=
휘인 존나 예쁘다 ㄷㄷㄷㄷ
=
미쳤다 미쳤다 하기도 이제 귀찮다.
=
omg,mamamoo espero verte en los MAMA Y MELON ,ESTE AÑO
=
Wowwwwww
=
무대장악력봐,,,, 관객들이 동화되는 마마무무대 내가 안사랑할수없어
=
They are always look at the fans with such a loving heart, always makes them a crowd like in concert, reel them into the song, makes them want to sing together with them! I even watch all of the MAMAMOO's stage in Queendom for more than 6 times already, I-...something in them resonate with me, making me want to watch again and again?? I... CONGRATULATIONS FOR WINNING GIRL 😭😭💜💜
=
아니 한국분 없으세요ㅠㅠ......
=
아 마마무 진짜 진짜 너무 좋음....
=
Dear International kpop fans, this is mamamoo video. don't mention other group. RESPECT MAMAMOO!!
=
raise your hand if you stan mamamo, if not then raise your standards
=
Mamamoo is the only group who has no weak member! Each one of the girls is very strong and talented alone or in a group ❤️ hear that vocals, it's heaven on earth😍 and that rap ❤️ gosh I can't breathe 😪
=
moonbyul marry me please
=
omayghad did solar got trip?
=
문별 멋있네
=
뭐야 돈좀 더 부어줘요 이언니들을 데리고 소품퀄리티 뭔일 돈좀 부어줘.. 돈좀막 퍼줘요 잘 밀어주고요 아이들같은 다른 그룹보면 돈 부어주고 엄청밀어준 티나는뎅 이건 언니들이 캐리함

On repeaT
=
진짜 마마무가 춤을 제대로 보여준적이 없어서 다들 춤을 잘안춰서 실력이 좋은거다 하는데 진짜 칼군무 개멋져 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Mamamoo is like a improvising jazz quartet, and they can read each other.
=
휘인 음색은 진짜 국보다 미쳤다
=
im a neverland and honestly I was rooting for gidle but when I saw this performance... lmao sorry but mamamoo totally deserved the win
=
이 노래 왠지 모르게 호텔 델루나 ost여도 좋을 것 같다ㅎ
=
I would like to say I' m Gidle fan but I respect that Mamamoo won they are good and I love their vocals! One of the best gg ever in k-pop ;) ,❤️
=
They're look like fallen angels but their vocals are like rockers❤

Angel Rockers!! Fighting!
=
Rather than a girlgroup, they suit word "diva" most.
=
옴걸 팬인데 2등해서 서운햇는데
1등하신 이유를 알겠네요
노래 너무 좋습니다. 😄
=
They wrote: we dont desert each other now 😂😂😂
=
3:02 Solar almost fell 😢
But they killed it and won, they are the best. ❤
=
Lendas maravilhosaaaas 🇧🇷♥️
=
Honestly for the final. My favourite songs were from MAMAMOO and AOA.
=
I can no longer count how many times I've watched this performance since they've won! and..I have already listened to this song before the finals and its really addicting..
ratata-tatata-tatata-tatata🎶🎶
=
This competition starts with MAMAMOO 💚✨
=

=

=
Is Mamamoo the only one who has a fanchant? I don't remember the other groups having
=
Hwasa’s outfit omg
=
Hwasa's short hair dear lord 😍
=
finale spot + 4 ultimate queens + chant-like chorus + signature crowd interaction = game over, no competition
=
Ineed mv for this song like g-idle
=
Mamamoo ❤❤❤❤
=
진짜 사랑해💘
=
Vocal wise, they are the best.  congrats Mamamoo. from Neverland 😊😊
=
타팬인데 진짜 문별님 랩 파트 정말 좋아요
=
I'M SPEECHLESS 😶
=
All the groups performed so well.....I listened to all the songs and watched all their performances   ....
Mamamoo never disappoints ♥️
I was scared as they always perform so well  ,I was afraid how they were gonna top all their performances..but afterall mamamoo did it once again ...
So proud of them ....their song and performance was so different and amazing...I loved every second of it ...the beats to🔥

Ultimate queens 👸👸👸👸♥️🔥
=
3:01 solar almost fall (again)
=
I got chills as soon as they started singing. My girls did the damn thing in boss mode. They won because they deserved too. Hell they could have sung the abc's and won! 😁 😁
=
Amazing mamamoo😍
=
역시 1위무대..🔥
=
5 minutes of overflowing *TALENT* and *BEAUTY*
=
완벽에 완벽을 더했더니 마마무가 나왓읍니다...
=
화사  :( 표정 왜케 웃기징 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I need offial mv of this song.
Love it
=
Solar & Wheein: 우린 결국 다시 만날 운명이었지
What I heard: *wulingyeolgukdashimannalunmyeongieotji* 😂
=
웹툰 나의 마녀 생각나는건 나뿐인가...엉엉
=
that prechorus with the guitar is SO GOOD
=
3:01 지금 발견했는데 용선언니
발목 삐끗한것 같은데 어떠케ㅠㅜ
=
I was crying the whole time when the announcement went out and they were the winners. More so when Hyejin choked. My babies, I'm so proud of you. 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
=
I already knew that this Queens has the possibility to bring home the crown
=
One word to Describe MAMAMOO 



*_QUEENS_* 💜🔥
=
Omg mamamoo is so good
=
"mama Muh"
=
Im obsessed with this concept. QUEENS
=
Anyone noticed at 3:01 Solar almost tripped?
=
제발 최종 1위라고 말해주세요 ㅠㅜㅜ 너무 좋은데
=
damn kpop not worth having them, i demand world tour!
=
1:50 !!! THE BACKUP DANCERS
=
THIS IS SO GOOD WTH 
ALL OF THEIRS PERFORMANCES ARE SO GOOD IM NOT EVEN SHOOK AT THIS POINT
=
Queens of engaging the crowd
=
I love you Mamamoooooo!!!!!
=
I hope they can make an mv for this song since they have done 2 mv before for their previous comeback such as starry night era.
=
I was rewatching this and i just saw solar almost fell around 3:02 she recovered so fast that it wasn’t really noticeable how P.R.O
=
I love Hwasa's hairstyle omg, she's so God
=
♥♥♥♥
=
They are legendary
=
♡♡♡♡♡
=
2:27
=
absolutely well-deserved. they sang live, delivered stellar performances and consistently brought something new and unexpected to the table at every round, to the point where it would have been a crime if they didn't win. so in conclusion, stan legends stan mamamoo.
=
기억나 맞아...언니 우리 그때 헤어졌잖아 그리고 이제 다시 만날거잖아 우린 운명이야 사랑해..!
=
So... this is gonna be long. 
Honestly I’m not a big fan of winning over popularity because, like many things in life, not because you win/lose something does it mean you truly deserved it. However, in this case, the popularity win was incredibly deserved, you cannot deny that. Why? Simple: our queens worked their asses off for years to achieve where they’re now. (MooMoos also worked incredibly hard but our main motivation was them) Of course a group from a small company is gonna have it harder than big company’s, again, that doesn’t mean that the ones for the big company don’t go through the same effort. 
Everyone did amazing in the competition. Stop fighting and bringing each other down. Yes, everyone deserved the title and I wouldn’t be mad if someone else had won. 
But I don’t know, the reason why stared liking Mamamoo the way I do is because they are different (not in the cliché way) you can just feel the connection through their music/performances. And that’s what an artist is truly like. It HAS to move you. 
They can make you feel fire inside with without even doing much. I feel like sometimes people want a performance with a lot going on(where it can come off as messy) but I think there are times when is quality over quantity and just because something is simple doesn’t mean that there’s not beauty in that. 
Their voices are outstanding, they are gorgeous, their presence is just undeniable. Everyone knows that. 
That being said, I really want to say so many things, but as a supporter of them I’m so happy and proud. I think our girls need to be proud of themselves the most. They are so amazing. 
Mamamoo, you truly deserve this and so much more. The best is yet to come.

역대 마마무 노래중 가장 좋았다
기승전결이 제대로 느껴졌다
=
마마무 정말정말 우승 축하해요
항상 응원 열심히한 무무들도
너무 수고많았어
문투도와준 분들도 고마워요
다들 ㄴㅓ무너무 사랑해 
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
WOAWWWWW
MAMAMOO
=
Solar slipped again at 3:03 and tried not to laugh hahaha. She's so cute. That little smile she gave to Moonbyul was so precious. But seriously what is wrong with the stage of Mnet. It's like she always slipped when they perform. Mnet you better fix your stage so that no one would slip again.
=
노래 개좋아 이거 그냥 음원으로 나왔으면 차트 다 쓸었다 ㄹㅇ
=
다른 그룹을 응원하고 있었지만
이 무대를 보는 순간 마마무가 1등임을 확신했다.
=
진심 수고 많으셨네요~최고의 무대였어요. 노래도 무대도 너무 잘했고 멋드러졌었네요. 마이크 지대로 들고 라이브 지대로 해주시고, 후반부 관객  호응 유도까지...마마무 콘서트 보는듯 했습니다. 마지막 클라이막스 솔라와 화사의 포옹까지 ...정말 멋졌네요. 박수짝짝짝짝짝 ~~~~
진심으로 나도 모르게 잘한다 잘했다 멋지다 하면서 박수쳤습니다.
=
빅뱅느낌 난다..다른 팀들과는 다르게 특유의 여유로움 진짜 빛남
=
이번곡은 멤버들 각자 음색이 돋보여서 좋은듯
우선 아녜진 도입부에서 그냥 미친듯ㅠㅠ
이번에 별이 랩 넘 좋다ㅠㅠ 맘무 컴백쇼 기대중 ㅠ
=
진짜 마마무는 다들 춤,노래 잘하지만 노래는 휘인이 진짜 오진다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 휘인언니 언니 다해 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
마마무로 시작해서 마마무로 끝나는 퀸덤
=
처음에 시작할때 진짜 영화같았음,,,,화사 도입 모든게 완벽했다
=
What makes MAMAMOO unique is that they include the audience to their performances. You won't just stand there and be amazed by their greatness but MAMAMOO will encourage you to participate, so people feel that they are part of the performance. That's why fans enjoy their stages because they connect to them in a personal level. 03:55 is proof and so as their performances in Immortal Songs.
=
Solar almost trippin' at 3:02 😰😱 but slayed as the true pro that she is!!! Queen!! 👏👏👏👸
=
I need a fancam of wheein😫. She be slaying the dances, my underrated dance queen
edit: OMG thank you all for the likes. First time I got this much likes 😳😭😂💀
=
i watched/listened to this multiple times, but like am i the only one who always break out of their resting face when hwasa makes that scrunched up face when she dancing hard at the chorus?
=
Simple but berclasses
=
Oh. My. Gohd
=
진짜 마마무 개 잘했으니까
마마무 앵간 깎아내리라고
=
Congartulation...
=
mamamoo is a real artist , their performance just like an art . i mean every single performance is just like a show , they are  enjoying the moment when they're on the stage . mamamoo deserves this win ,yea
=
Still watching
=
Single terbarunya girband mamamoo'sangat bagus'dan keren apa lagu lagu hip
=
Quá đỉnh luôn
=
solar 😍😍😍
=
“(Kpop) Idol” does NOT apply to MAMAMOO.

MAMAMOO are ARTISTS. PERIODT. 👑💚✨
=
Only  thing  ı love  about  the  song   moonbyul  s part  😍
=
I don’t know what to say. I’m just so proud being in their fandom. I’m so proud to be MooMoo. I love you, MAMAMOO! You’ve done so much more than enough but hey, there’s still more. Just wow! 💕🏆 사랑함니다, 마마무! 💕♾
=
Does anyone know wether or not Mamamoo is going to make music video for this? Because this song deserves an MV
=
After watching this I get why Mamamoo won.   They didn’t just put on a show, they WERE the show, meaning each one of them was captivating.   They made you FEEL something.  It starts with the vocals.   It’s not just about hitting notes, it’s about EXPRESSION and EMOTING.   They felt like WOMEN and the other groups felt like GIRLS.  (Same goes for Bom).
=
아니 이렇게 잘하고 멋지고 섹시하고 예쁘고 카리스마있고 노래잘부르고 실력좋은데 누가 팬덤빨이래
=
도입부 부터 헤지니가 무대를 찢어 버리는구만ㅋㅋ
=
So basically there are a lot of ppl claiming that MMM won bcoz of their popularity or big fandom base COME ON
Lemme tell u that MMM start with zero fans 
Came from a small company
They have to do busking on streets where no one recognize them
They had the OLD image when they first debuted 
They went on Immortal Songs and put up good performances but no one knew them
MMM fandom wasn’t built in a blink of an eye we MooMoo chose to be their fans bcoz we knew how much effort they put in to become good artists 
The other grps on Queendom might have experienced the same as MMM and YES I liked all of the stages in Queendom final but pls don’t waste time spread hate when u can love someone more with all yr might 🌝
=
아니 박봄 아이들 옴걸 차례로 보고 이거 보는데 최종회그냥 미쳤네 그냥 다 돌았네 미쳤네 그냥 ㅅㅂ 진짜 미쳤네 다 왜이래 개미첫네 걍 다
=
The difference between mamamoo and the other groups is that mamamoo doesn’t need to go way over the top to be amazing, this performance was in many ways way simpler than the what the other gg’s did. But yet they were the best performance of the night because of their strong vocals and charisma. I’m so proud of them❤️
=
이 무대 들을 때부터 아 마마무가 일등하겠다.. 생각함 ㅠ
=
I'm in love with moonbyul's part 😍
=
Every performance, it feels like watching a concert. They're just sooooooo amazing
=
Mamamoo harmonizing together needs to be a more common thing in their songs!! So beautiful
=
The only girl group I love 💚 Their vocals and stage presence are INSANE
=
OMG I REALLY LOVE WHEN THEY SAY NOW SCREAM 😢😢
=
3:02 Solar, be careful. Moonbyul is concerned.
=
하 진짜 문별 눈썹 들썩일 때 마다 아주 그냥 내 마음도 들썩들썩 온 세상이 들썩들썩 진도 10.0 기록했다네요;;
=
Wow el final es especialmente mi parte favorita, ver a todos los moomoos coreando "tatataRatatata"
Y la fuerza que ellas pusieron en este performance...increíble
=
Hope they release special episode, last gathering or clips of idols beeing together 💕💕💕
=
This is the real art 🖼
=
Proud moomoo here! ❣️
=
MAMAMOO is the real definition of QUEENDOM!!! 😍😍😍 Congratulations!
=
I love mamamoo!!! AMAZING SHOW!
=
진짜 미쳤다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 무대위 존재감 정말 엄청나다..
=
They truly deserve that win! So proud of them 💜
=
I repeat it again and again WAHHHH CONGRATULATIONS!!!
=
Oh my God so amazing 🌹🌹
=
별이언니 랩 딕션이 왤케 좋아..?
=
진짜 얘네 미쳤다..
=
Anyone saw Yong trip again???😂😂😂
=
3:30  Make sure y'all got that screenshot xD
=
All I can say is.... I love them so much 😍👏🤗
=
Oh ......my heart 🔫
=
Congratulations Mamamooo...
=
마마무 팬인게 자랑스럽다❤️
=
Congrats My Queens !!!! <3 <3
=
While watching all the performances yesterday, I realized how every group deserve the win, but when I watched Mamamoo's I said to myself that there's no way they will place lower than one. People in the comment section said that some haters are trying to discredit them because they're popular in SK, but if you think about it a group will get to that point of popularity if they got the talent of being an idol/artist.
=
3:00 때 솔라언니 넘어질번ㅜ 언니 안넘어져서 다행 맘이 넘 아프다
=
Whoaaaooo daebak...finally our Mamamoo win🏆, congratulation🥰, U deserve it🤟
=
Mamamoo are a national treasure.
=
요번 노래 뭔가 끌림이 있네..와...비트가 너무 좋다. 안무도 대박인데!!의상도 넘 멋지고 머리도 찰떡인데?'우린 결국 다시 만날 운명 이었지'
=
Byul! You made me want to be your girlfriend 😭
=
hwasa looks are so powerful, i fell more for mamamoo 💕💕so happy to know that they won, atlast they prove to everyone that they are the real queens 💕💕
you know guys ive been a fan for a year and I know that they are not famous or has a fandom like those famous kpop groups such as bp twice red v g idle etc. You can also watch random kpop dances and it's rare to have many people dance to mamamoo's songs because they are not recognized towhat they deserve unlike other groups that aren't even so talented and confident like mamamoo. Mamamoo deserves to win they catches soul unlike other groups who just know how to be sexy and such btw i dont hate other groups i love them but i still see the difference
=
My queens. 😍😍😍😍😍
=
진짜 화사언니 욕하는게아니라 마조리카 닮아서 너무 귀여워요ㅠㅠ계속 마조리카입 생각나..♥
=
that’s like one of the most beautiful and amazing songs i’ve ever heard
=
I stan legends..
=
완전 목성에서 지구로 날라오면서 봐도 1등감.... 축하해요🥰👍🏼👍🏼
=
문별언니 숏컷함 해주면 안되나요....진짜 반할 것 같아요😭
=
Why is no one mentioning Hwasa's short hair!!!! 
+ Queens are on fire 🔥 
No wonder they won ♡
=
멀리서 찍을 시간에 전체 안무를 찍어주세요 계속 얼굴만 클로즈업 하지 마시고
=
MAMA needs this performance!!
=
미쳤다미쳤어.........겁나멋있다진짜
=
Congratulation mamamoo
=
Mamamoo congrats!!!!
=
Hwasa n Solar 😍🙄😍🙄😍☺️☺️😁😁
=
I hope they have another song like this wind flower and Starry night
=
so some fans out there are saying mamamoo in bcoz of popularity, hey you, do they knw that mamamoo works their asses off to give us wonderful performances, their song charted high than other ggs participating in queendom. K netizens love their songs, whether they are promoting it or not. K netizens didnt even question their credibilty, lets be honest its actually the intl fans who complains abt mamamoo winning. Its not all abt performances, its abt the song dude, and also popularity? they are popular bcoz their songs are so good to listen and they work hard for that.
=
Elas estão deslumbrante, não consigo mais parar de olhar, são muito maravilhosas ❤️
=
MAMAMOOO WILL FOREVER BE NUMBER 1 IN MY HEART 🥺💕
=
Hwasa short hair is back😍😍
=
Mamamoo never disappointed
=
No wonder they won....
=
우린결국다시만날운명이었지 를 줄일방법은 없었나 훅부분이 넘 길어
=
So who thinks this song will be on the new full album?
=
PLEASE LET THEM HAVE A WORLD TOUR CONCERT😭
=
Dance practice pleaseee😍😍😍
=
Writing this comment because it hurts me when certain fans are bringing other groups down...


I don't understand why people would complain that MAMAMOO won just by popularity...
Undeniable, every group stands out, I love all the groups, they all did amazing!


But this performance really gives me all the goosebumps...


If you really wanna talk about popularity, (G)I-dle definitely has more views and likes compared to MAMAMOO (I watch (G_I-dle  too, because I love their performance too, such talented girls).
Please stop saying MAMAMOO won JUST by popularity... just acknowledge their hardwork and talent... There's no need to bring down other groups just because your bias didn't win...


Like what Moonbyul says, everyone is a winner.
Let's just appreciate how all six groups bring joy to the audience.


I love MAMAMOO and was interested in (G)I-dle since LATATA, they brought me to watch this show, and I'm delighted to see Park Bom (2ne1 is the group that makes me fall in love with kpop), surprised with AOA's charm (such cute personalities and cool performance), amazed by OH MY GIRL's wholesome performance (plus they have extremely friendly vibe), motivated by Lovelyz's positivity (they are so daring to challenge themselves through different genre).

P/s: Agreeing to what Marylin Urquieta(from the comment section) says: "our queens worked to achieve where they are now".
P/s 2: Please stop complaining that MAMAMOO didn't dance as much compared to other groups... First, they dance and looks incredible with their moves... Second, dances are cool, but they are called singer, singing comes first, if they feel more comfortable with these types of choreography to sing, let them be! (I definitely can't dance like them, its tough)
=
Shitttttt 😍
=
Whenever they look at the camera, its like you can feel the connection, its them singing the song to you.
=
풀캠 보세요, 꼭 보세요.
=
솔라랑 별이랑 자기파트 끝나고 성큼성큼 걷는거 오ㅑ케 좋지
=
믿고보는 마마무  ㅋㅋㅋ 배신하지않았어
=
i repeat 4:40 on and on
=
0:32 Can we talk how the dancers walk solar in the stage
=
看完全部舞台。真的…真的!mamamoo最棒，不愧是第一名。简简单单就超有感觉的。根本不需要多余的东西，他们4个就可以撑起了
=
I saw Solar tripped

Like if you guys see it
Or comment...
Or whatever
=
The performance itself was simple but left a feel of why it end so fast? A feeling of wanting more remains. Mamamoo was simple and at the same time powerful.
=
아닠ㅋㅋ 엠넷 편집이 별로여서 생방이면 그나마 나을것 같았는데 킄 카메라 미쳤나?ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 그나마 맘무 노래하고 노래실력하고 얼굴이 살려준거닼ㅋ
=
😍 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍
=
와 ... 이번무대 진짜 화사 ㄹㅇ 너무 이쁜데...
=
진짜..최고 화사는진짜연예인하려고태어났네 반하겠다
=
춤 추면서도 ar뚫고 들리는 라이브가 너무 신기하다ㅠ 마마무 사랑해ㅠㅜ
=
맘무는 원래 잘해서 기대안했음 잘하니까.. 그냥 잘한 무대 보고 말지 했는데 보니까 노래도 중독쩔고 앞으로 더 오래했음 좋겠네.. 마지막에 솔라가 우린 결국 다시 만날 운명이였지에서 죽은척.. 소름이 쫘~악 돋았음..
=
휘인.. 내 최애인게 너무 자랑스럽다..
저 목소리는 아무도 못이겨
=
I thought the song was gonna end 3 times but it didn’t lol
=
우승 축하해여ㅠㅠㅠ난 언니들이 할 줄 알았어ㅠㅠㅜ진짜ㅠㅠㅠㅜ사랑해ㅠㅜ
=
Mamamoo... Deserve to win.. Why... Bcoz.. Their so talented.. Their music difference from other group kpop song..... Mostly they interact with audiences....Mamamoo is real artist... That why they deserve to be call Queen...congratulations Mamamoo and moomoo...

English: Destiny

=
와. 이번에 문별언니 랩 레전드찍은느낌...
너무 잘어울려ㅠㅠ
=
I got chills, there’re multiplying
=
다른 아이돌들도 엄청 잘했지만 화려한 퍼포먼스나 장치 그런거 없이 순수하게 가창력과 흘러 나오는 포스, 관객과 호흡하는 것으로 승부를 보는 마마무가 너무 멋있다😍😍1등 축하해요👍👍👍
=
My maaaaaaaaamaaaaaaaaamooooooooooo💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
=
문별 발 얹으면서 랩하는거 킬포..
=
Your'e all the best queen
=
Wait  I thought it was byul harmonizing with Hwasa but it was Solar ??!!!😲😲😲
=
다른거 다 제외하고 순수 노래음원으로만 봤을때 난 이 노래가 젤 좋더라
=
I. NEED. AN. MV. FOR. THIS. SONG!
=
The stage is so simple, lackluster even, if i dare say, Yet the friggin chills are still there!! I'm not devoted enough to call myself a fan, but damn, can't get bored watching them perform
=
Mamamoo won the show?
=
I just watched the rest of the contestants' performances. Tho they're impressive, they all look like idols performing for comeback. While mamamoo right here really owning the stage. Their vocals, charismas, swags and moves are on a whole another level compare to the others.


Also the other contestants' performances are too messy with too many dancers or their dancers' clothes simply match them. I can't even tell the difference between the idols or the dancers anymore. Glad mamamoo wore white while the dancers wore black.


Edit: my comment here is a general one but you only care about g-idles and keep fighting about 'em. Not even once y'all mention the other contestants' that i supposedly "lowkey shading". Just say you hate mamamoo and want g-idles to win and go. Sheeshh.
=
i lovee mamamooooooo so muchhhhh
=
Wig snatched I thought gidle had a hot performance this right here was life
=
what’s crazy is how busy Mamamoo was outside of Queendom, they were going to many events so they had to make time for queendom, not only that but they must be exhausted, i hope they get their deserved rest now that queendom is over 💖
=
무대하라니까 혼자 콘서트 하고 가셨네....
=
걍 마마무가 마마무 했네;; 지렷누 언니들 열심히 해서 좋은 모습 보여주는 것두 너무너무 좋지만 제발 제발 건강 좀 챙겨요 또 악플이나 안 좋은 글 보고 속상해하지 말고 무무들이 써주는 좋은 글, 응원하는 글만 보고 같이 걸어가요 마마무랑 무무 영원히 손 잡고 행복하고, 건강하게 무길만 걸어요 사랑하누 놓지 않을게💗💗💗💗
=
팬석 20석아님? 응원 살화냐?
저걸 언제 맞추었지 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I want Gleam and Destiny to be performed on MAMA2019
=
도입부부터 포스가 다른 걸그룹에선 못느끼는 포스가 느껴져서 마마무가 우승을 할줄알았다 갓마무..
=
The girls killed this performance in every way possible with their vocals dance and stage presence🔥🔥🔥🔥




Also special shoutout to WHEEIN ..... she needs more love💕💕💕
(Plus her voice was so angelic😇)
=

=
妈妈木实至名归啊!我爱四姐

Hi MAMAMOO. Hope you will read my comment. I just want to say thank you so much for making me happy and inspired. Please stay healthy and safe so you can continue to inspire us with your great talents. Do not mind your haters. Your fans, US, are more important than them. Please if you are sad or feeling lonely. Do not hesitate to message me. I am here always for you guys. Stay humble. I LOVE YOU MAMAMOO! ❤️
=
Oh my wheein looked like she lost a whole lot of weight
=
ok but like solar tripped @ 3:02
=
Did anyone else catch solar tripping again at 3:02 No just me?
=
마마무가 마마무 했다
마마무는 이번에도 무대를 찢어버렸다
화사의 도입부에 끝장나버렸다
솔라의 춤선에 반해버렸다
휘인의 음색에 귀가 녹아버리는줄 알았다
문별의 랩과 눈빛에 넋놓고 봐버렸다

마마무 1위 너무 축하해 고생많았어요❤️
진짜 뭉클하고 울컥하고 그랬어요 ㅠㅠㅜ 놓지않을게🙏
MAMAMOO  -  MOOMOO   =   0
=
Mamamoo deserve win.. they are the real winner... they are my pride of kpop 💕💕💕💕💕😍😍😍😍😍
=
Ah they are best not only in vocals, I am glad that they won!
=
One thing i notice evertime mamamoo performs, they always connect with the audience as if audience are part of the group..everytime they perform you will feel that they really love their fans..by the way count me in as a new moomoo. Cant wait for their comback..Congrats Queens you rrally deserve the title..
=
I have read some comments saying Mamamoo is popular in Korea, but for me they are still underrated, considering the vocal and the stage presence they deserves more than this.  Well done MMM, bring it on. I know they will win MAMA's vocal award.
=
solar slipped and looked hurt
=
문별 너무 심하게 예쁜거 아니냐... 심장 폭격을 멈춰주세요 그리고 앞부분 팬들 함성 없었으면 싶다... 후반부는 같이 어울려서 괜찮지만........... 멤버들 이름 부르고 이런거 안 했으면 좋겠다ㅜ 노래 도입부에 흥이 깨져서...
=
Is it a new song ?!
=
So what if the choreo is kinda easy? They still rock the stage and hype the audience. Their stage presence,facial expression and attitude on stage is lit. And that's what you call a performance.
=
Please look at Solar closely at 3:02. This is the second time after she almost fall down during second round "Good Luck" performance.
=
아니 아이들도 그렇고 코디들이 다 미쳣나봐;;;;;;;;;
=
또 한번 실력을 입증한 무대다..
=
솔라호호호호호호호호호호
=
Slayyyy!
=
hwasa is literally the korean beyonce
=
노래가 뭐가 중요헌가 어떤노래든 무대 씹어먹는 마마무♥
=
화사 도입부 뭐냐구ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
진짜 몰입감 대박이잖아....

Okay not gonna lie I'm a hUGE moomoo but honestly guys a member of G-Idle literally wrote and created Lion, which literally blew me away. Mamamoo has the best voices hANDS DOWN but let's not shit on them because the talent in that group is also UNREAL. My love for Mamamoo has never been so threatened by another group before and it's leaving me so shook
=
Killed it. Nailed it.
=
마마무내인생최고가수임. 존멋 노래개잘하고 노래진짜좋음. 항상멋진무대보여줘서너무고마워요
=
너무 멋잇다라는 표현이 마마무 한테는 부족 할 정도로 대단해!!!
=
Mamamoo is really an awesome group, they're just true to themselves and their music, I'm not even a stan but their i miss you performance made me cry fr, they're true artists, and the way they always find ways to connect with the audience during the performances is awesome too, also hwasa is awesomeee she's always so into it
=
Let's applaud for those Moomoos who supported our girls during the performance.
They were so supportive and passionate, cheered for our share as well.🙌👏👏
=

근데 솔직히 얼굴만 예쁜 그룹들은 빨리 잊혀지는데 실력이 좋은 그룹들은 레전드로 남는거 같아요
=
보고 또 돌려보고 또 돌려보고 ㅠ.
=
마마무 사랑해 진짜
=
첫 소절부터 소름 쫙
=
Las mejores del universo 😍🙌 Reinas de la vida! ❤❤❤

=
그냥 마마무가 마마무했어
=
Looks like other contestants forget to make a fanchant for the final song 😅 to much focus on performance they forget to engage with their own fandom 🤭🤫😌
=
RBW please  I hope you showed MV Destiny
=
Honestly if MAMAMOO won by having a great fandom, I don't care ... what matters to me is that I win
=
카메라 맘팁언니한테 넘겨라
=
Just yesterday i saw the lyric video for this..and now i can see them perform live...MAMAMOO have my respect..always great on stage..they killed it🔥🔥🔥love them more n more💜💜💜
=
Congrats Mamamoo!!! , but at 3:02 Solar tripped and almost fell
=
to those who say that mmm's performance is effortless comparing to other groups , well gays this is a SINGING show , music is for listening not watching...
=
This song, their voices are just AWESOME!!!!!!!!

=
Omfg I feel so lesbian-
=
대박
=
the POWER
=
퀸덤 다 좋았어요ㅜㅠ 아이들은 신인답지 않게 멋있었고 더 발전할 가능성을 많이 본 것 같았고, 오마이걸은 새로운 모습을 많이 보여줘서 너무 좋았어요 러블리즈는 그동안 하면서 나아갈 방향을 헤메는 것 같아서 조금은 안타까웠지만 오늘 경연 보고 많이 성장해서 괜히 뿌듯했고ㅜㅜ 마마무는 역시는 역시다..같은 느낌? 우리 보컬 이정도야 하는 걸 많이 보여준 것 같고 에오에는 경연도 경연이지만 일상에서 되게 의외인데 친근한 느낌을 많이 받아서 넘 좋았고 마지막으로 봄..😭 솔로라서 고생했을텐데 이겨내줘서 고마운 마음? 멋있기도 했어요ㅜㅜ 다들 최고😍
=
휘인언니 ,,,,,, 난 늘 언니에게 진심이란걸 알아둬
=
와 진짜 멋있다 마마무 1위하는 이유가 있어 진짜로
=
카메라 워크가 무대 다 망쳐놓네 개빡친다 나줘 내가 찍게
=
I’ve just watched all the other performances and I completely understand why mamamoo won. The other performers were really focusing on making it as big as possible, like in your face u know? With this performance mamamoo proves that to be a queen you need to be able to shine on your own and they did just that
=
They are such professionals Solar almost fell but she caught herself and really quickly fixed herself. Amazing 🤩🙌
=
아 진짜 최고다.... 최고야...... 마마무 1위 축하해..ㅜㅜㅜ
=
카메라는 어딜 자꾸 찍는거임 백댄서를 찍는것도 아니고
=
ARTIST: MAMAMOO
SONG: DESTINY
GENRE: MAMAMOO
=
마마무 1위 진짜 축하해요ㅜ  나도 보면서 같이 울었다고ㅠㅜ 엄마 몰래 100원 투표 했는데 그건 모르겠고 1위 진짜 진짜 축하해요오ㅠㅠㅜ
진심 무대 찢었어 우리 언니들 진짜 이 세상 사람이 아니야 언니들은 천국에서 막 내려온 천사같다고 어떻게 그렇게 이쁜건데 머리색깔 봐 와 진짜 저 색이 어떻게 잘맞는거냐고 흐어ㅓ 노래 잘하지 춤 잘추지 랩도 잘하지 끼 많지 비글거리지 이쁘지 귀엽지 카리스마있지 프로미 넘치지 팬을 너무 잘알지 와 진짜 어떻게 그렇게 사람이 완벽할수있는건데ㅠ 진짜 사랑하고 놓지않을게 마마무💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
=
Oh my girl: at the top
(G)-idle: as they are the top
Bom: 'cause she was the top
Aoa: knowing they're the top
Lovelyz: for the top

Mamamoo: for their fan
=
Lol but this definitely look like their own concert
=
Queens 👑
=
I’m soooo excited to see them perform this on MAMA. I’m sure it’s going to be 10000x lit 🔥
=
화사 단발 갓갓갓갓갓
휘인 블루 갓갓갓갓갓
우린 이제 컴백쇼에서 봐요
=
뭐야...미쳤어... 초번에 솔라 등장할 때 진짜 뮤지컬같이 등장한거부터 이번 무대 진짜 작정하고 많이 신경쓰고 고안해냈구나하는 생각들고 머리 자른거랑 염색한거에 너무 이뻐서 놀랐고 이번에 휘인 머리 진짜 너무 찰떡으로 어울리고 음색은 말 안하더라도 진짜 국보급이다 매번 특히 문별 랩이 이번 곡에 진짜 잘어울리는거같다 화사도 고음나오는 부분이 많아서 좋았고 누드톤 입술 자주 바르다가 이번에 확 튀는 색깔로 바꾼것도 강렬하고 네 명 다 의상도 표정도 메이크업이랑 머리도 하나하나 박수치고싶다 정녕 아이돌 클라스라니ㅠㅠ... 마지막에 다같이 퍼포먼스 할 때는 소름 쫙 돋고 무대에서 즐기는 모습 진짜 너무 찬양해.. 마지막에 화사랑 솔라 안는부분에서 새들이 서로 감싸주는듯한 이미지라 더 고급스럽고 성스러워ㅠㅠㅠ
=
파이널 아이들이랑 AOA만 기억에 남는다는 댓 보고 왔는데,,, 뭔 소리여 마마무 독보적인데..? 심지어 카메라도 거지 같은데 한번에 와닿음.. 다같이 즐기는 마마무 마인드가 이번 퀸덤에서 잘 드러나서 좋아😭❣
=
Hands down no question to why they won. Just looking at this already proves whatever questions you have to why
=
정말 누구와도 비교될 수 없는, 할 수 없는 마마무를 또 각인시켜주는 무대...마마무만의 노래, 퍼포먼스, 감정 등은 최고인 것 같다👏🏻👏🏻마마무 1위 축하해요!!
=
when solar tripped and almost fell, i’m glad no one noticed and they still won lol
=
Kill this love but Mamamoo
=
마마무가 왜 일 등 했는지 궁금해서 보러 오니까 일 등 할 이유가 있었네 진짜 멋있다
=
아아ㅏㅏㅓㅓ 생방 볼때 심장떨리면서 봐따구요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅡㅠ 언니들ㄹ 1 등할 줄알았써요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅠ
=
After watching all the performances I realised why MAMAMOO stood out. No doubt every other performance was excellent, given the choreo, music, costumes and especially the props and background dancers, but MAMAMOO was the only group which performed not as a team, but as friends. Their skill in impromptu stage antics, 'blink-and-you-miss' moments, ability to engage the audience and real talent in harmonising on stage (and not with the original track) made them so different.
=
Auténticas Artistas 👍, min. 2:41 esa parte me encantó
=
EU DIGO ROM E VC DIZEM POM POM
ROM!!!!!
=
Omg solar almost tripped again 3:02 hope she's ok
=
四姐都霸氣又炸掉舞台。
=
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Too much for me!
Speechless!
=
마마무가 워낙 기대감이 커서 많이 힘들었을 텐데 늘 좋은 무대 보여준 게 너무 대단하다
