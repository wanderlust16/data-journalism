=
Who is here after listening to cl rewind?
=
I don't think people understand how powerful this performance is.
=
I like her final stage. She's not that typical who will perform with a strong concept and to impress others. But instead she performed to express herself and her feelings.
=
Parkbom is nominated for Best vocal solo performance in MAMA 2019! Please vote her 🙏
=
She didn’t do this for the competition she did for herself and us her fans. The emotion she shows here is magical. ❤️
=
Someone in the Korean comments mentioned that she says “you/너” three times - I miss you you you -  alluding to the three girls she misses.
=
박봄 퍼포먼스가 부족하다고 그러는데 솔직히 나는 스토리성 있는 이 퍼포먼스가 더 좋음.. 꼭 춤을 화려하게 출 필요가 있나? 그거야말로 고정관념아냐?
=
2ne1모르는 요즘 애들은 이게 그냥 사랑노래로 여겨지는게 슬프다...
=
그리워하는 "너"를 보통은 사랑했던 연인을 떠올리기 마련인데 단번에 멤버를 지칭했던 걸 알아차리게하는 봄,,,,,,
=
My grandma says you can never win a competition when you carry a heartbreak.. But you can win and gain hearts that knew the weight of your longing..
=
All of BLACKJACKs/Bomshells know what bom wants to tell to whom with this song.
=
“난 여기 있을께”란 가사가 왜이렇게 슬프게 들리는지..박봄이 퀸덤에 나온건 우승을 위한게 아니라 멤버들에게 마지막 무대 이 메시지를 보내기 위함이 아니었을까
=
Girl did high notes without an earpiece..

Bom is not a legend



She in god tier
=
CL's reply was "rewind" she wants to comeback too..
=
이 공연은 분명 메세지가 많다...내가
열심히해서 꼭4명이 다시 선다는 약속도 하는듯한 느낌이 들어뜸.
=
스포트라이트가 비춰지지않는 황금, 보라,  주황색 마이크 스탠드가 이렇게 슬플수 없다....
늘 함께였던 너, 너, 너 라고 하며 너를 세번 말하는것도 미쳤어...
=
박봄언니 음색이 진짜 하나 안변하고 그대로라 더 눈물남 노래에 그리움이랑 아련함이랑 간절함같은 슬픈감정이란 감정은 다 들어간느낌 개인적으로 you and i랑 spring 파이널곡 연속으로 들으면서 감정이 주마등처럼 막 스쳐가는 느낌이었음 퀸덤에서 후배들 보면서 2ne1활동했을때 정말 많이 생각나고 그리워했을것 같아서 더 맴아프다 파이널곡은 후배 걸그룹과 경쟁하는 사이에 홀로남겨져있는 박봄이 절벽끝에 서서 2ne1 그리워하면서 되돌릴수 없고 돌아갈수없지만 4명이었던 그때로 돌아가고싶다고 외치면서 멤버들 부르는거같음😢
=
Queendom did her bad. She deserves MORE than this! She was a member of the most powerful group 2ne1! It was LEGENDARY and even as a solo artist she's standing strong! You can do it Bom! Fighting!!!
=
Its crazy how she didn’t win queendom when her voice, presence, stage appearance, is just spot on every single F****! TIME!! It’s very sad to see how people can’t really appreciate raw true talent. Park bom won queendom in my reality! Ugh this just upsets me because that song gave out so much emotion you can tell she put her souls into it and you can feel and sense where she was coming from!! Blackjack foreva
=
This is such a genuine performance. She’s telling a story and not trying to win
=
정말 박봄이 투애니원 멤버들을 진심으로 그리워한다는게 노래로도 무대 구성으로 너무 느껴져서 마음이 찡해진다...
=
Now I realized that her every performance in this show is all about her and her 2NE1 girls.
=
진짜 단 한번만이라도 이부분에서 너무 눈물난다 진짜 진심으로 봄에게 봄이 오면 좋겠어..
=
She's not just a Queen anymore, she's a Legend.
=
Park bom: wanna go back
Cl: Lets go back
😢
=
Park bom : Wanna go back
CL : lets go back 

Ah my heart 💔😭
=
She's trying so hard to tell everyone that she misses 2NE1. Exactly how, we, Blackjacks feels. We want them back. No matter how many years passed by, we still want them.
Love you: Bom, Dara, CL, Minzy 🖤
=
When she sang 'i wanna go back" as she passes by the coloured mic. im in TEARS
=
이건 진짜 대박이다 박봄 안 죽었어 봄 언니 하고싶은거 다 해
=
와 어떻게 인이어가 빠지고서도 노래를 저렇게 하냐 ㅜㅜㅜ 진짜 대단하다 처음빠지고 끝까지 다시 못낀거 같은데도 고음 질러버리네 진짜 최고의 보컬리스트다 박봄...
=
She missed the moment friendship Not the popular things
=
WE NEED 2NE1 ON MAMA 2019!! Who's with me? 🧡💚💜💛
=
봄언니 사랑해요 아 진짜 이거 보니까 계속 눈물이 미친듯이 나와요 옛날 생각 많이 나고 왜 봄언니가 순위가 밑인지 알 수 없어요 진짜 제일 멋있고 제일 잘했어
=
3:35 "너" 지칭 세번임 와 개소름 돋
=
Let's just appreciate the fact that CL too make "rewind" and stating let's start again~ 2NE1 Reunited anyone?
=
I don't know but I feel like crying when I watch this.. 😢
=
투애니원 팬분들은 알거에요 스탠딩마이크 보면
박봄 마이크는 초록색 나머지 색은 투애니원 3명 멤버들, 그리고 백댄서 의상 크러쉬때 의상이고,무대장치 때문에 더 감정이입하면서 감상했네요
중학생 때 투애니원 노래 들었던데 엊그제같은데
제 나이는 벌써 이십대 중반이네요 
그때의 열정적이였던 투애니원 추억 잘 간직할게요
댓글 다 외국분이신데 한국분들 좋아요 눌러주세요
박봄 활동 앞으로도 응원할게요!
=
In light of recent tragic events, this performance really drives it home for me how our idols are affected when their group breaks up. After decades of living and training together like a close-knit family, all of a sudden everything changes, and everyone goes off to their own projects. The only way of life they have ever really known simply ends. How does one get over something like that, no matter how rich and successful? I do not presume to understand how they feel, but from what little I do understand, it must be horrific. I have the utmost respect for Park Bom for showing her feelings so openly and with such power, and I truly wish that she and her girls find their way back together again. This performance goes straight to my "most memorable" list.
=
They did her so dirty..... Bom had the most emotion and she seemed so deticated
=
나는 왜 박봄이 그냥 좋지?
=
Now I know the story behind the coloured microphones it is so touching..
=
박봄은 노래부를때가 제일 빛나는거같아  노래 너무 슬퍼ㅠㅠ
=
She really wanted 2ne1 to continue but fate tore them apart and now she's standing alone in a stage without her members
=
So did anyone notice how at one point her earpiece fell out and she was trying to put it back in but she never succeeded? She still managed to sing beautifully and hit that high note, what a queen
=
I can't tell how many times i've watched this and still get goosebumps.
=
She is a living legend. She doesn't have to win.. she already won our respect and even more.
=
왜이렇게 눈물나지 .. ㅜ 봄이언니 하고싶은거 다해 ... 진짜 짠하다 옛날감성 제대로다
=
Bommie noona said: “neo (minzy) neo (CL) neo (dara) miss you so much”


Really miss 2NE1 God :(
=
I think she's won already by having friends with her juniors and that's what most important.
=
The clock ticks 13 times. Bom was a trainee of YG 13 years ago. Wow
=
she didn’t win queendom, but honestly this song was the most emotional after all she been through. and as other said, yep she didn’t deserve the last place. anyway she won my heart and i hope she’s not disappointed
=
And now, everything has become a reality. Bommie and Dara comeback, CL comeback. What we need to do is wait for Minzy. Our girls, come back home.
=
Almost make me cry because her insecurity and feelings are so real here
=
who comeback here after CL released Rewind mv
=
I think she means she wanna go back with her 2ne1 members
=
The girl represents her during her hiatus, as she covered her physical appearance conveying Park bom's concealment away from the society during that 5 year hiatus. As the girl started to dance, her movements emphasises bom's breaking out of her shell, trying to regain her confidence in what she does best - which is to sing again. Halfway through the video, the other 3 microphones clearly represent the other 3 2NE1 members, accentuating on the fact that Park bom has never forgotten them, in fact  they'd always been her backbone eversince her comeback. 

this is in fact one of the greatest comeback ever!
=
BLACKJACKS Y BOMSHELLS 
VAMOS POR 2 MILLIONES DE VISTA!!!
=
박봄영상인데 왜 마마무 얘기가 나와 짜증나게ㅋㅋ 아니 이영상 저영상 가도 마마무가 낫다는 말이나 마마무도 짱~ 이런 얘기 꼭 있는데 걍 마마무 영상에 가서 댓글 달아
=
I pray that she'll make a music video for Wanna Go Back.
=
첨부터 끝까지 2ne1 팬으로써 보고싶다...누가  뭐라하든 그냥 2ne1노래를 사랑한 팬으로써 보고싶네요..
=
Mamamoo win the queendom, but this performance won my heart.
=
Her highnote in this song... I think that is the highest she ever reach... Im crying rn
=
Park Bom will release her comeback "First Snow" on December 10 feat. Sandara Park!
=
Park bon is nominated for best solo performance at 2019 mama go vote for her here - 2019mama.com
=
This performance has better than 99% likes.
=
박봄은 애초에 솔로다 보니까 팬덤 싸움에서 밀리긴 하는데
매회매회 혼자 열심히 하는 모습이 눈에 보여서 너무 좋은거 같음
=
if she had participated with other solo singers she would win
=
Park Bom is Telling she misses 2ne1, her song has a story. SHE IS THE WINNER
=
노래 진짜 개좋음. 퍼포먼스빼고 노래만 보면 박봄이 제일 좋은 것 같음
=
The clock ticks 13x... that's exactly 13 yrs ago when she began her musical career. Goosebumps!
=
바닥 효과 - 투애니원 앨범 표지 (2NE1 1st mini album)
스탠딩 마이크 4개와 금색, 보라색, 빨간색 마이크 -  투애니원 멤버를 상징
백댄서 3명의 의상 - 투애니원 마지막 무대인 MAMA 무대 의상과 일치
마지막 봄누나 춤 - 투애니원 수록곡 "In the club" 안무

결론 - 개현석 양새끼
=
단순한 사랑노래가 아니라 투애니원 얘기하는듯
=
I'm still not over people betraying her in the media but I never will be. I am so glad she got back up o stage. She's goddamn amazing and a STAR
=
Stan a Queen Stan Park Bom👑
=
This performance is one Ill love its just not a performance,  it was memories Bom unnie had throughtout her years as a singer and that is so creative to put it into a song, FOREVER A BLACKJACK 💜
=
She is legend. I literally cried watching this. She already won.
=
I'll be here
I'll wait til you come back
-Bom

Minzy left her agency
CL left YG
What does this meaaaannn
=
3:41초쯤에 혼자 춤추실때 2ne1 In The Club 도입부 춤 같아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ4명에서 한무대 서있는걸 다시 봤으면 좋겠다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I never see any girl group in this world has a good connection like 2ne1. Cuz they are like a real family to each other.
=
She really like a queen....
I think the final 1st is her.... Although I'm a fan of mamamoo...
=
SHE'S NOT COMPETING, SHE'S JUST SERVING US ART ALL THIS TIME!!!!
=
Entendí la referencia 😭😭😭💔
=
2:02 "just one more time" she missed her group so much 🙁
=
That's what we need in KPOP
=
너너너가 너=민지,너=다라,너=CL 이 의민데 마이크 3개 빨강=다라 보라색=민지 골드=CL 초록색=박봄 이래서 더 슬퍼요 ㅠㅠ
=
이번화 만큼은 카메라가 정말 잘살렸다 박봄이랑 상의해서 이렇게짠건지는 모르겠는데 상식적으로 거울 반대편 박봄이 진짜 박봄일리가 없는데 카메라돌아갈때 거울박봄도 진짜라는 생각도 들게하고 일어나서 춤출때는 과거 박봄이랑 현재박봄이랑 분리된 느낌이들고 박봄에대한 몰입을 한층 더 높여준거같음
=
2:09 " I still miss our last day together " 😢
=
I've watched this like 5 times in the last 24hrs and it makes me cry everytime I hear it
=
OMG HER VOICE IS AMAZING 😍😍😍SHE MAKE ME CRY, I LOVE HER VOICE 😭😭SHE IS UNIQUE
=
I cried when she hitted that high notes.
=
She doesn’t need to prove anything we all know that she is the Queen
=
my queen
=
Stan Talent Stan Park Bom👑❤️
=
This is such a powerful performance. I'm left in a mess of tears and feelings. I'm still not over 2NE1's disbandment... 😭😭 I'm so, so upset.
=
ㅠㅠ 봄아 너무 멋있다 눈물날거ㅏㅌ어
=
This performance is a behind the scenes of her life after 2NE1:

She begins with hiding her face in shame singing “I’ve lost my way”, afraid of the harsh words of the public as she reflects at her past self 

She then finds the courage to stand up again and not hide her face, to sing again without her fellow members

She then finally rises to the top because she’s found her way back while still representing all that 2NE1 was and who SHE IS. A TRUE QUEEN AND WE CANT FORGET THAT HIGH NOTE 

It’s such an emotional performance I know I can’t hold back the tears 😭😭
=
Award winning performance !!! So full of feelings so charming !! Her voice was the best ! Her looks stunning ! I connected so deeply with her performance and the lyrics. She’s a goddess indeed! She’s been trough so much and she’s grown so much she’s so strong ! We love you Bom unnie  you are our Queen 👑😍❤️
=
Don't understand how she ended up last in ranking... but I'm not bitter about it because that wouldn't be fair to all the other Queens.
It's just that Bom is goddess ha!
=
솔로가 할 수 있는 최대 그리고 최고의 무대였음
=
The four mics are 2NE1 .
=
1:36 Aren't we gonna talk how badly she wanted to be with her ladies on this show? *DAMN* Why can you just let Park Bom reunited with 2ne1?! She may not win, but she deserve a stage with her Group members! 😢😭
=
2NE1 is one of the groups that got me started in K-pop, just after they debuted.  It seems so long ago, now.
No surprise, I have grown older, just as Park Bom has.  This song cuts deeply.  I want to return to that past along with her.
I adore this song.
=
It was like a beautiful classical opera stage.  
Her vocal is the only one in the world.
Her stage concept is only one, too.
This uniqueness makes me always thinking of her and waiting for her.
=
유앤아이 때는 마이크가 문제더니 왜 지금은 인이어가 문제냐..
=
Woaah. I'm crying again 😭😭😭😭♠️♦️♣️♥️
=
모든 추억..과거를 회상하는듯... 빨간머리...비워져 있는 3자리... 보라색(민지)마이크..금색(씨엘)마이크...빨간색(다라)마이크... 이제는 같이 할 수 없지만 서로를 멀리서 바라보며 응원하고 성장하겠다는 의미를 담고있는거 같아...ㅠㅠ 그리고 과거의 일들을 모두 자신이 다 짊어지고 가겠다는 의미도 보인다....슬프다...
=
Oh my God, i felt sad😢
Its 2ne1!!!
=
Fudge I really cried.. I can't take the reality that my queens are not in same group
=
*I WANT A 2NE1 STAGE REUNION AT MNET ASIAN MUSIC AWARDS 2019*

_do you want it too?_

let's hope & pray...
=
2:08 이때 부터 인이어 빠진거 같은데ㅠㅠ역시 무대 경험 많아서 그런지 빠져도 계속 안정적이넹..
=
Here's the thing: this whole performance is an entire production worth a MAMA stage. It doesn't even feel as if she's competing, zero competition vibe just her performing as if she's promoting it on normal music shows or an award show and that is that. That's amazing
=
From what i can glimpse, 2NE1s breakup, and her scandal have left a gaping hole in her heart, that is still healing.
I believe she is writing music to heal her soul,  her voice is so sad and painful, but at the same time overflowing with beauty.
This entire stage is her trying to relieve her best moments, but at the same time realizing there is no way to go back to those innocent days.
Park Bom deserves the world.
=
i love this song :,3
=
The meaning of this song is so nice, my heart melts, and I know Park Bom misses her members, 사랑해요 팍봄❤️
=
After all this time her vocals still shines!!!! So crisp and clean!!😱😱😱
=
I CRIED SO HARD AND STILL CRYINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG BOMIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
=
I missed park bom's voice
=
Seeing those colored mics, I'm crying ❤️
=
Do you know why it hurts and still it hurts us ? Coz we know how much they love performing together but their company dropped them without  knowing anything...
=
봄언니, 아무래도 그룹도 해체됐고 솔로로 나오다보니까 팬들 화력도 딸리고 퍼포도 남들 보여주는 것처럼 보여주기 어렵고 무대 채우기도 벅차고 순위도 밀리고... 많이 힘들고 지치고 불리한 부분들이 많을 거예요. 혹여나 이번 파이널 순위가 1위가 아닐지라도 너무 속상해하거나 상처받지 않았으면 해요. 저는 그룹들 사이에서도 혼자 밀리지 않고 당당히 맞서싸운 언니의 모습이 진정한 퀸의 모습이라고 생각합니다.  투웨니원 시절의 봄언니도 지금의 봄언니도 언제나 퀸이였다는 걸 꼭 기억해주세요.
=
When the 1st mic appear, I cried so hard. It was just 3 mics and back up dancers that represent the rest of 2ne1 members but I cried so hard everytime I watch this performance. Why? 😭♠️♦️♣️♥️
=
This perform just try to present that her really miss with her grup, hope it someday can be perform together again
=
I have watched this performance a few times now. Some things are remarkebale. But the one thing that gets me every time is Bom looking into the camera at the beginning. All this talk about being a queen.... rankings and votes.... It really does not matter.
Thank you for coming back, conveying your message and staying strong, Bom. You truly are the best! This was glorious!
=
I’m literally crying

I miss 2NE1 too much...
=
음원을 들으면서 가사가 누가 들어도 2ne1을 그리워하며 쓴거라 생각했고,,그룹에서 솔로로 무대에 서면서 느꼈을 그리움과 쓸쓸함이 너무 잘 느껴져서 눈물이 났다,, 진짜 무대에 마이크 색깔별로 둔건 진짜 보자마자 울컥,,, 거기에 마마 그때 그 의상을 입은 백댄서라니 ,, 진짜 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ퀸덤에서 그룹들을 보며 얼마나 투애니원을 그리워했을지 느껴졌고,,,그들에겐 2ne1이 청춘이였을테니까 ,,아무리 팬들이 그리워하지만 본인들보다는 아니겠구나 했다,, 마지막으로 다 같이 무대에 섰을 때 했던 빨간 머리로 다시 염색하고 그렇게 아끼는 초록색 마이크를 사용하는 걸 보면서 진짜 모두가  행복했으면 좋겠다고 생각했다,,, 마지막에 추억의 반짝거리는 무대에 올라가서 혼자 in the club을 서툴게 추는 걸 보며 또 한번 울컥했다... 2ne1 팬이였고 아직도 기다리는 사람들이라면  울 수 밖에 없었던 무대ㅠㅠ 순위를 떠나서 진짜 혼자서 그룹들 사이에서 퀸덤이라는 프로그램에 서서 도전해줘서 고맙고 언니 이제 행복해져요 진짜 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
damn it! I cried so hard watching this. I hope 2ne1 can stand and sing on the same stage again.
=
When I see the 4 mic I was like wow.. I feel the 2ne1 is reunite with her performance the 3 members sang with her too..... I Love them
=
미쳤나봐.. 이게 진정한 퍼포먼스 아니냐 누가 우리 봄언니 퍼포먼스 부족하다 그랬어
=
All times I see this performance, my heart broke in a million of pieces. I have never seen a disbanded group so alive like yours... 2ne1 FOREVER, THE ORIGINAL QUEEN!
=
yall want 2NE1 stage on MAMA 2019 yet some of yall cant even vote for her to win on MAMA
=
Even though Park Bom didn't place first place, she'll always be first place in my heart...😢😢😢😢😢
=
I'm so proud of u queen
=
Damn... I have no words only tears 😭
=
I've watched it again and again since the day this video was uploaded

Like if you do it👍
=
박봄 진짜 혼자 하느라 얼마나 힘들었을까 그룹 사이들에서 자기만 혼자고... 그동안 너무 수고했고 다음에도 이렇게 많이 만나고 싶어 무대에 네 명이서 마이크 잡고 서있는 거 눈물 난다.. 3:40 투애니원 인더클럽 안무인것도 킬포 ㅜ
=
와... 언니는 정말 그냥 내 평생 여신이야 ㅜㅜ 돌아가면 좋겠지만 돌아가지 못해도 결국 언니는 내 여신이야 ㅜㅜ
=
Whenever Bom sings in Queendom, I am always in tears. But the moment I saw the mic stands, I sobbed. Bom is missing her members, it is all written on the song. Bom, you are the QUEEN. No questions asked.
=
I swear I started to cry a lot when I saw those microphones...
=
This video deserves to have more than 2m views
=
진짜 박봄이 2NE1 활동하던 때로 너무너무 돌아가고 싶어하는 거 같음... 퀸덤하면서 다른 후배그룹들 볼 때마다 항상 멤버들 생각했을듯... 안쓰러워... 이름처럼 꼭 봄날이 와서 꽃길 걸었음 좋겠어요🌸
=
봄 늘 응원합니다! 슬픔을 딛고 또 새로운 모습 많이 보여줘요!
=
Damn, this girl is blessed with that voice.  One of the best of South Korea, definitely.
=
마지막에 무슨 안무인가 댓글보고 알았다..
=
In this Last Performance she wanted to let go of everything and finally be in peace with herself.
=
Win or lose shes still the queen of all
=
😭😭 SO TOUCHING 💕💕
=
That mics! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
I love her more when she just sing her heart out.. Conveying a story of utterly longing emotions, heartache and that strength pursuing something she had lost.. I just felt it every time my spring queen..
=
I saw the presentation of the theme in the Queendom and the moment when the 4 microphones are shown, it simply broke me in a thousand pieces, because for me they represented the 2NE1 girls, it also made me think of one of the queendom episodes when all the groups They were writing their songs and then Park Bom was sitting alone in the center of the practice room and said she felt lonely and missed the girls. This song, even though I don't speak Korean, managed to convey all those feelings to me and that's why I love her. Please give a lot of love to this song that is pure art. 💕💕
=
The four mic with the same color makes me feel shocked. You might not have win in this competition but your always a queen in my Heart.  From a real Blackjack :)
=
This song breaks my heart 😭😭
=
Omg im crying🥺😭
=
While watching her performance I am missing 2ne1 more. Crying af 😭😭😭😭
=
Oh my God I love you♥
=
Win it or not, you will forever be our Queen! The song is truly amazing and full of emotion. Never tired listening to this.
=
3 empty mic when she walking to the middle perfectly saying she missed 2NE1 as a whole. Blackjacks forever!!💗
=
Bom always has the most moving and heartfelt performances and she really gives her all every time she’s amazing and so brave for going on this show by herself!! I love her she won to me
=
I'm crying. 😭 2NE1 will always be the best. 😭❤
=
Tears filled my eyes as I saw the four microphone stands.
=
The one and only Queen BOM 💚💚💚💚💚🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽 the best forever with you baby 💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻💚💛💜🧡2NE1 always in my heart ♠️♣️♥️♦️
=
봄이 너너너 = 너 씨엘. 너= 다라, 너=민지일수도 있고 블랙잭일수도 있다고 했어요 ㅠㅠ
=
Oh yes, when I See Those 4 Mics Together... my Blackjack heart 😭😭😭😭
=
WHAT THIS IS AMAZING OMG
=
This was not a simple performance, this was a whole TRIBUTE❤❤
=
Go go go 2M is coming❤️
=
the emotions she must have been feeling as she was performing this i’d be having a breakdown on stage and there she is, singing her heart out. shes my role model.
=
THE CONCEPT IT'S ALL ABOUT 2NE1!!!!! 😭❤
=
I love you so much park bom! 
I miss 2ne1 so so much.
I cried watching this, i feel her emotion so much with this song.
Ill always be a fan 💗
=
스탠드 마이크에 멤버들 마이크는 꽂혀 있지만 멤버들은 없고 소리낼 수 있는 사람은 박봄 혼자라는 무대연출 자체가 소름이었다
=
this is just so precious uwu~ the meaning behind this is so priceless~ park bom sunbae is already a winner here~♡
=
Thank you for this, Bom 😭
=
I don’t know much about the history of 2ne1, but damn this performance has so much soul and story, it makes me feel heavy hearted. Like I hope she gets what she misses. She seems so heartbroken and sad!!
=
진짜 2ne1 생각 엄청난다 ...

the dance she was dancing on the last part of the song is the dance for their song 'In the Club', one of their first songs.
=
I'm crying uncontrollably 😭😭😭😭 this hit hard.
=
You are THE ORIGINAL QUEEN! I cried a lot! You are so beautiful! You deserve all, MY QUEEN! ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU!! I ALWAYS LOVE YOU❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑😘😘😘😘😘😘💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💋💋💋💋
=
Thank you queen Bom! Thank you for coming back this year and blessing us with all this music! Thank you for being strong all these years and believing in yourself! You are our angel. We love you and support you.
=
Literally crying from the start
=
Ok but can we send some love to d-nation for supporting this amazing woman and fighting for her to be on the stage again, where she belongs. 🧡💛💚💜
=
This stage was truly amazing!! She sounded insanely good. The performance wasn't simply a musical performance it was literal Performance Art!! It 100% conveyed the emotions deeply embedded in this song. Park Bom is phenomenal at conveying her emotions through song. Not only does she emote well her voice is just TOO SPECIAL!! Her vocal tone / vocal color knocks me out EVERY TIME I hear it!! I've been a fan for so long but I am still madly addicted to her voice!! With each release she made this year (like 10 songs total including the Queendom tracks) she has consistently surprised and wowed me with her unique voice and I could not want any more from my Queen. She really delivers as a singer. Wow, what a time to be alive- Park Bom's reign has come! Long live the Queens (2NE1)- they will all be reigning soon enough.
=
I got goosebumps watching this and it makes me feel like she is showing what she went through at YGE and she misses her friendship with 2NE1. I really hope there will be a 2NE1 comeback reunion 🖤. Forever a Blackjack♦️♠️♥️♣️
=
The four mics tho- 🥺my blackjack heart cant😭😭😭
=
I want to cry 😭💜
=
진짜 우리시대에 2NE1은 레전드였고, 지금도 그립고, 대단했던 그녀들이었다. 박봄은 감히 그 중심의 보컬이었고, 시간이 많이 지난 지금도 우리도 같이 돌아가고 싶은 그 시절은 화질흐린 영상으로서만 가능한 일일것이다
=
D-Nation please do MV for Wanna Go back.
=
OMG, is this even live?? I missed her vocals so much <3 T_T
=
I cant get over this song, its so beautiful!! Miss the girls!! Blackjack 4ever! ❤🖤
=
4 mics, dance, the way she drop her mic, reminds me of 2ne1. i can't contain my emotions. crying rn :(
=
이 프로그램에 우승을 독차지하고 이기려는 욕심보다는 정말 과거를 그리워하고 멤버들을 보고 싶어 하는 게 보여서 마음에 와닿고 너무 안쓰러우면서도 응원해 주고 싶다 정말 여기까지 너무 열심히 왔어 대견해요 사랑해 박봄 언니 늦어도 언젠가는 돌아오는 날이 있을 거예요 아직까지 기억해 주는 사람들이 이렇게나 많은데...... 파이팅 파이팅 마음에 있는 상처는 모두 지우자 우리 언니가 짱이에요 짱짱
=
Damn she threw her mic!!!
I hope the junior idols get out of this performance that if they love being with their group, live in the moment and enjoy every moment.
=
ijust mis them together T_T but im so proud of Bom like everyone <3 lov Bommie <3 and 2ne1 forever T_T <3
=
And CL reply in her song "rewind"
=
I LOVE HER!!!!!! AMAZING!!!! <3
=
This is like 2NE1 reunion omg I'm crying
=
She really misses the group!!  😭
=
For me this is the most emotional performance I ever saw in my entire life😞
=
Omg i almost brust into crying when i saw 4 micro
=
I really really love her voice. It's very unique.
=
뭔가 퇴위한 여왕을 보는 것 같다. 새로운 시대이고 한때의 영광은 이제 후계자에게 물려줬지만 여전히 명예롭고 찬란한 여왕인 사람.
=
Im not even a 2NE1 fan What why I feel like get crying 😢
=
LITERALLY IT IS A CONCERT!
=
I cried when she was surprised with Minzy's video, it was so nostalgic and beautiful 💕
=
I am crying while watching this. I'm so proud of  QUEEN Bom 👑 this is very emotional for us blackjacks. I miss 2ne1 so bad😭
=
그거 아세요 님들 공민지 뮤직웍스랑 소송중이고 산다라 CL 둘 다 곧 계약기간 만료라서 셋이 문제 해결하고 박봄 소속사 디네이션으로 모일 가능성이 농후하다네요 무엇보다도 멤버들이 2NE1 재결합을 간절히 원하고 있구요 YG가 투애니원 이름 쓰게 해줄지가 문제지만 비스트가 하이라이트가 된거처럼 이름 바꿔서 재결합 가능성 열려있다고 합니다 퀸덤 여파가 큰가보네요

※ 어디까지나 가능은 하다는 얘기지 아직까지 재결합에 대해 제대로 논의하거나 결정된 부분은 없습니다 저도 그 누구보다 간절히 투애니원 재결합을 바라는 사람이구요 2010 ~ 현재까지 박봄 좋아하는 블랙잭입니다

※ 2019년 11월 8일부로 CL YG와 계약 종료됐답니다
=
idk if its just me but i got so many goosebumps and tears just from this simple (yet amazing) performance. once a queen, always a queen.
=
I'm crying 😭😭 why do u do this to me bommiee? I love you forever queen
=
I cried when i saw the four colored microphones 😭
=
I cried. That's it. The emotions, the performance, those meanings. ♡♡♡
=
Bom's stages aren't the flashiest, but they are the only ones that move me to tears.
=
Whos here after watching cl new mv? Rewind???
=
MY HEART.
=
She really have a unique voice that others don't have 😭 omg i really love her voice really 😭❤️
=
I like that there were 4 mic stands and that the 3 dancers somehow resembles her 3 members from 2ne1.. gosh i'm missing 2ne1 big time..😭😭😭
=
이 프로그램을 진행하는 순간순간 박봄이 2NE1을 그리워하고있음이 너무 진하게 묻어나서 너무 먹먹하다...
=
I just cried!
I'm adding this on my freaking playlist
=
I'm crying right now ... I don't know so much about 2ne1 but this music ... Made me cry 😭😭😭
=
This made me cry like crazy I miss 2ne1, my teen days
=
I applaud Park Bom for going through this survival show alone, I never thought it was fair for her because she had to come up with her own performance ideas but in a way the quality of her performances reflects how great her mind is and the effort she put in is a first win in my book.
=
처음 거울과 마이크들 4개 있는 연출까지 완벽하고 소름 돋았다 지금 퀸덤 파이널 무대 정주행 중 인데 이 상태로면 소름 돋은 걸로 부피 두꺼워질 것 같음 1무대 1소름
=
QUEEN OF KPOP !
=
Amazing 😍
=
I’ll never stop loving you Bom 💖
=
for me, it resounds to my heartbreak! it’s flexible to be situated for everyone’s situations. i love it so much even though it hurts me repeatedly 😊
=
그는 오늘도 레전드를 찍었다 
2019 10/31 10시 34분
=
Park Bom has been underrated during the whole competion
and you can't deny it
She slayed whenever she took the mic
=
The other 3 mic shows it all😭😭
=
she is the queen, 2ne1 forever <3
=
why is here after listening to Cl done？
=
I cried too 😭
=
3:38 
We also want 2NE1 to Go back...
=
Awe the colored mics of the ladies of 2ne1!
=
이번 씨엘님 신곡 듣고 왔는데 두분다 2ne1때를 너무 그리워하심ㅜ 다시 네분이 같이 한 무대에 서는 날을 볼 수 있음 좋겠네요
=
#2NE1onMAMA2019
We want that so bad, am I right blackjacks?
😭😭😭
=
I crieeeeed! 😭 I miss 2ne1! Badly! 😭
=
I cried so much! I love this song
=
진짜 음색대박이다...독보적..
=
I was crying as soon as minzy gave Bom the video message and I kept crying throughout the whole performance. But as soon as I saw those mics I bawled my eyes out. I love 2ne1 so much and I would literally die for Park Bom
=
봄아 돌아갈 수 없으면 다시 만들면 돼. 이 노래 부르기 전 부르고 난 후 민지가 보낸 영상 보고 우는 모습이 아직도 기억난다.. 우리만 그리워하는게 아니라서 한편으로 기쁘기도 하고 마음도 아프고 ㅠㅠ... 행복하자 봄아
=
😭😭😭😭🤧🤧🤧🎤🎤🎤🎤 2ne1 2019😢😢😢😭😭
=
SHE ALR WON MY HEART SINCE 2NE1 ERA :')
=
이때 박봄이 연습하면서 입은 츄리닝 세트 어디껀지 아시는분ㅠㅠ
=
OMG I’m soooooo dumb! I’ve watched this for the 50th time and just realised the backup dancers represent the other members of 2NE1!!!!!!!!
=
봄이가 정말 잘해내구있구나..
우리 투애니원 마이크 보고 눈물이 많이 났다.
너무나도 완벽한 무대였다
항상 응원할게
지금 처럼만 잘 버텨줘... 사랑해 봄..
=
0:48 did she say, so let me goo😭😭, what if this whole preformance refer to what it felt when she was under YG
=
I miss 2NE1 I swear. It's so sad to see Bom as a solo artist now, I hope we get a reunion soon. I'm just glad now CL left YG.
=
All i can say is "i cried "
=
Damn you YG how could you 😭😭
=
박봄 인생의 디오라마를 무대로 꾸며낸 것 같다... 무분별한 감동팔이 추억팔이가 아니라 절제되어 있으면서도 선명한 무대와 호소력있는 보컬로 동료들과 본인의 과거에게 헌정하는 퍼포라 가슴이 다 뜨거워짐ㅠㅠ  솔로무대라는 걸 잊게 만드는 몰입력까지... 최고다 박봄 응원합니다ㅜㅜㅜ
=
Bom shoted right in my blackjack heart ♥
=
THE RED HAIR IS EVEN FROM THE LAST TIME THEY PERFORMED AT MAMA T_T
=
노래 진짜... 음색 ㅠㅜㅜ 박봄 진짜 넘 잘한다 ㅠㅜㅜ
=
this performance makes me believe that 2ne1 will make a reunion concerts one fine day :')
=
와 이번무대는 투애니원과 학창시절을 한 우리라면 모두가 감동받았을만한 무대인것같습니다ㅠㅠ 처음에 박봄씨의 과거라고 말하는듯한 똑같은 겉모습을 한 다른분과 함께하는 부분도 너무 소름이었어요 정말 좋은 무대보여주셔서 고맙네요ㅠㅠㅠ
=
This was probably the best performance by park bom. It was so beautiful but also depressing. I will start supporting Park bom for now on because she's actually very talented and an amazing person.
=
박봄 너무 멋있고 응원해 ㅠㅜㅠ
=
Fudge i cried so hard watching this. 
THIS IS 2NE1. 😭 Thank you so much, Bom! I felt that.
=
박봄 당신뿐이야 여전히 사랑해
=
She's so strong. The first part is clearly her trying to say that understand y'all when y'all say that she needs to dance and move more on stage. She used a dancer to that, and staying in front of the mirror showing that she's thinking, it was heartbreaking. The four mic stands... I can't. I just feel like you Park, and cry too.
=
I cried so much..
=
0:34 ok, im getting emotional
=
YESSSSSSSS QUEEN! SO happy to see my faves coming back! first brown eyed girls and now Park Bom 😍
=
Ilove her all if the 2ne1
=
She really did her best in every performance at this unfair competition.
She is the sacrifice in this game.
Because no matter how many times she trys, that's impossible for her to create the strong veiws which compare to other girl teams with huge members.
I think she knows the truth, but she still keeps fighting against the truth. Keep going because, in this tough road, I will still support you.( I love your special voice since the beginning of 2ne1)
=
It's broke my heart when I realized that this song didn't win in Queendom, I'm not a fan but this song got me
=
I cried... love you Bom❤️
=
I wish 2ne1 comeback together 😭😭
=
Im a big fan of 2ne1 and i will support every one of them even tho they become a solo artist i will support them but still hoping for their comeback as a group. Park Bom youre such a queen i love your song and your voice 😭😭😭 were so proud of you and every one of you ❤❤❤
=
Who else watched this over and over
=
*incoherent sobbing noises* 🥺
*drowned in tears*
=
Wow! This is so heartbreaking!! I'm crying so bad!!
=
This is soooooo sad 😭😭 I Love you 2ne1 Forever ❤❤❤❤
=
나 정말 솔직하게 박봄언니가 엄청 잘하는건가? 이 생각을 가지고 있었어 음색은 좋지만 노래를 잘한다 이 생각은 못가졌었거든. 근데 퀸덤 무대를 보고 점차 회차가 갈수록 너무 대단한 사람처럼 느껴져. 노래로 사람 마음을 울리고 치유할 수 있는건 아무나 할 수 있는게 아니잖아. 근데 그런 능력과 노래 음색과 감정과 또 파이널은 더 좋은 목상태로 불러서 그런지 너무 너무 대단하고 멋지고 너무 고마워.
정말 퀸덤을 보면서 울었던 무대는 다 봄언니 무대였어. 보통 발라드는 슬프고 끝나기 마련인데 희한하게 봄언니는 슬프고 그래서 더 견뎌야겠다는 생각이 들어. 괜찮아 괜찮아 너는 해낼 수 있어. 아파도 괜찮아 힘들어도 괜찮아 너는 이겨내고 모든걸 해낼 수 있어. 이런말들이 들리는 것 처럼  너무 고마워 너무 너무
=
Yass 2M👑❤️
=
박봄.코리아 마돈나.너무멋쪄.여러 걸그룹이하는것보다.혼자하는무대가 더 화려합니다.눈물났어요.너무 멋있다.감동적입니다.솔로 대뷔하세요.홧팅
=
Not to sound like i am crapping on the other groups but IMO this is the best out of the whole show. The song and the performance have a deep meaning the artist and not just trying to put of the flashiest show. But I guess it just proves the masses like the catchiest song out there and not one with soul. Think about it in 10-15 years the young girls of the other groups will be singing their own version of Wanna go back. Hopefully when the time comes the public dont just throw them out like they threw out Bom
=
This makes me so emotional.. I have loved 2ne1 since I was 11 and I am now 21.. I grew up with 2ne1 and will forever be a blackjack. Bom won in my heart and will always have a special place in my heart.
=
MY BLACKJACK FEEELS😭😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️
1.THE 2NE1 MICS
2.THE BACK DANCERS CRUSH OUTFITS
3.IN THE CLUB DANCE DURING THE END
4.THE CLOTH ON THE STAGE IS SAME COLOR / SHADE AS 2NE1 FIRST EP
5.BACK DANCERS DANCING SAME CHOREO AS FIRE BY 2NE1
=
2ne1 …. I ALWAYS LOVE YOU FOREVER... CL BOM DARA MINZY LOVE
=
The lyrics even mention goodbye literally the last song from 2ne1 ....I miss 2ne1 so much
=
3:26 I started sobbing
=
When I saw the 4 colors of her band mates it tells this on my mind that this sing she sung is for her group.
=
4 mics for 4 members of 2NE1 !!! Who miss them :(
=
노래 ㅈㄴ 좋은데??
=
CL out of YG. Minzy leaving her agency. I smell a 2ne1 comeback... PLEASE!!!! I will pray for this!
=
Does she mean “wanna 2NE1 go back” ? I feel like that when i listen it. Omg!!!
=
كوييين كوييين 💚 بارك بوم كوين 💚
=
What the heck, the camera really tricked me in the beginning, the other one really looked like Bom when she stood up
=
there is nothing can stop my tears after I watched this....
=
I am crying! This is a piece of art! So emotional! And you can see what an amazing singer she is! Without that earpiece it is so difficult for singers to hit their notes correctly! But she slaaaaayyys!!!
=
We really miss 2ne1 😭
=
I love that she had 3 backup dancers. Somehow it felt like a 2ne1 performance. I miss them <3
=
this made me hide in my room and cry all day with my cat omg, the power she has i can't 😭
=
Those mics were used by 2ne1 :( I badly miss them 😣
=
i feel her emotions :(
=
그냥 봄 언니 노래만 들으면 눈물이 난다
=
I’m not crying. The moment that there’s a mic for the members and 3 girls appear with the same costume of 2ne1 Omg i miss theeem
=
늘 박봄언니 노래 들을때마다 놀라요 언니의 목소리는 늘 제 마음을 파고 들어오거든요 마지막 까지 멋진 무대 하시느라 수고하셨어요! 언제나 응원합니다♡
=
This song makes me cry so much and these lyrics 😔
=
wanna cry, when i saw the 3 mic standing..... bom really want to comeback as 2NE1 again
=
WTF this performance is masterpiece
=
존나 울었다 진짜 마이크 네 개인 거 보고 울고 투애니원 분장 보고 울고 하 여왕 안 해도 괜찮아요 1위 아니라도 괜찮아요 제발 행복해요  ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅠㅠ
=
waou ! goosebumps from start to end
love you my queen <3
=
The pure emotion in this performance...😭😭
=
Bom u just make me cry 😭 i miss 2ne1 so much. Blackjack here
=
this is the most beautiful final she could give us, thank you, thank you, thank you unnie, thank you for loving BlackJacks and Bomshells so much
=
The moment I saw the other members mic’s i started crying... miss them so much
=
Her voice so fairy❤️✨
=
My heart 😭😭😭😭😭
=
1:38 마이크 싹 보여지는데 놀래서 입막았
멤버들 마이크 이자나여 맞죠!!!🙈🙈😢

난 진짜 마지막 경연곡 다 좋지만 이게 이곡이 더 좋았다고 느껴지고 딱 음원공개 되고 처음들었을때  4명의 모습이 머릿속에 그려져서... 가사도 그렇고 전달력도 그렇고 역시 박봄이구나
=
I'm crying !
=
Regardless of the performance, all of Bom’s songs are songs I would actually listen to. Bom has a talent for making music sound good and you can recognize her voice anywhere!
=
I cried the entire performance! My blackjack heart
=
We love you, Park Bom 😭
=
This performance is already as good as a music video
=
그떄 그 아름다움을 가장 그리워하는건 우리 팬들이아니라
그당시에 누구보다 아름다웠던 그들이였구나
=
Her voice <3
=
She tried so hard. Parkbom is nominated for Best vocal solo performance in MAMA 2019! Please vote her 🙏mnet 2019 vote . You need only sign-in
=
There won't be another voice like Bom
=
Cutest pop star i know ✌️
=
Yasssss queen 😭👑❤️
=
Goosebumps 😭😭
=
I cried so hard and support for Unnie, even when I saw the colour microphones, which belongs to every 2ne1 members and I miss 2ne1 so much. But she didn't give up and she stood strong for her fans and Minzy supporting her. At first, I thought that there really they're with Bom performance, and at that point, I couldn't hold back my emotion and I was happy for her. She brings me memories of their performance back then, also together on stage. I love you Unnie! I'm a fan of yours. FIGHTING!!!!
=
2014 mama 보고 여기 왔는데 넘 슬프네 ㅠ
=
SHE DID A FCKING G5 LIKE NOTHING WE WON'T APPRECIATE THAT? THAT'S THE HIGHEST NOTE SHE EVER DID I THINK!
=
I'm crying 😭😭😭
=
Omg im literally at work crying. God, i miss 2ne1
=
love it <3
=
I miss that time, too... I miss 2NE1. This performance and this song made me cry like crazy. My eyes are just like waterfalls.
=
백댄서들이 마이크 들고 있고 헤어스타일보면...뭔가 투애니원시절을 그리워하면서 멤버들을 그리워하는 거같다...ㅠㅠ
=
Why am i crying
=
This is so sad. And the fact that this could( and probably will)happen to the new YG groups is even more upseting.
=
2ne1 will always be the Legends 
Thank you Park Bom💓
=
The Queen guesting this show🔥. i love all her performance she is just overqualified also Queen is Queen no matter what award she receive still she's over the top.
=
WE NEED 2NE1 TO SAVE MAMA 2019 IM VOTING HARDD
=
She looks awkward in dancing, but her vocal is no doubt, absolutely amazing and unic.. she deserved better.. before this i don't know who is she, but after Queendom (and search history from her past),i'm in love~  i'm her new fans.. ^^
=
I wish it wasnt just park bom, that it was 2nei performimg with her
=
Me too.. I wanna go back where you, cl,Dara and minzy performe in stage as one  but I know can't go back the time .. but I as a blackjack still love you and waiting that comeback/ last performance in stage ...   
#2ne1
#blackjacks
=
Parkbom Looks like a princess
=
She is my winner ❤
=
아 진짜 눈물나 슬퍼서 숨이 안쉬어져ㅠㅠㅠ 제발 나중에라도 네명 멤버들 다 같은 무대에 설 수 있는 날이 오기를...
=
THOSE HIGH NOTE ARE LIKE HER EMOTIONSSSSSSSSSSS
=
4 mics..... it break my heart
=
스텐딩 마이크는 2NE1 멤버들 개인 컬러고 댄서들은 In the club 당시 멤버들 의상, 헤어, 안무를 추는데 알아본 팬들은 얼마나 눈물이 나겠냐고ㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠ 봄 마지막에 추는 안무도 In the club이고 너, 너, 너가 그리워 부분에서 하필 세명인 것도...ㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
저 마이크들 2NE1 멤버들 마이크잖어..ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ진짜 찌통에다가 눈물나옴요......박봄이 그 시절로 돌아가고 싶어하는 마음도 느껴지고 너무 눈물나와요..
=
I missed her so much! Growing up I always looked up to 2ne1 as my favorite kpop group. It's the group that introduced me to kpop. Their songs were revolutionary like fire and the solo Bommie did "you and I". You can do it bommie! Fighting!
=
Ohhh damn I am crying 😭😭😭😭😭💕💕
=
Yeah please! Just one more time, one more day. Let us see 2NE1 singing live again. 😭
=
이게 퀸이지 박봄이 퀸이지
다른 그룹들을 더 좋아하지만 지금 이 무대가 퀸이다....
=
Queen 🇧🇷❤️
=
miss 2ne1 so much :(
=
This video steals tears from me whenever i see Bom with the other 3 dancers in black... She's legend now~
=
4 microphone 😭
=
씨앨 골드

=
Keep coming back, n everytime I get goosebumps 😍😍
=
Ohhh Bom-unnie your vocals makes my heart warm...
=
오랜 시간이 지나가도 우리 서로 기억해요, 그 때 서로가 있었음을, 그리고 아직도 서로가 있음을
=
CL already  left YG
=
i'm cry so much
Park is really queen of Korea
i miss 2ne1

YG OVERR
=
This song is so good!
=
박봄 마지막에 춤추는거 너무 귀여워♥♥
=
this performance and song shows how her life runs after the disbandment. she's such a strong woman. bom is our superwoman!
=
마지막 춤  인더클럽 안무인데 봄양 나이도있고 예전에 이뻣던 리즈시절 몸매도아니고 지난날을회상하면서 조금넣었던거 같은데 감상은 지난 2ne1라이브 인더클럽 감상하시면 좋을듯
=
I can only cry during the performance, so proud of her.. i feel you bom, i love 2ne1 and miss you all so much, wish u all the best
=
Your voice is my strength!❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Que hermosa Canción llore... (T_T)
=
와 마이크 멤버별로 색 다른 거 다 세워놓은 거 봐...
=
Perfectttttt
=
아니 무대가 너무 좋아서 자꾸 들어오게 되네
=
진짜 이무대 내 눈물버튼.. 볼때마다 울게됨..
=
4 mic for 2ne1 member.. I can't 😭😭😭
=
뜬금없는 봄누나 춤보면서 이생각 했다. 봄누나가 난 춤은 여전히 못추지만 우리의 추억이 담긴 춤은 기억하고 있다고 추억이 몸이 기억하고 있다고
=
I want to see you come back 2ne1
=
Damn at 2:00 it really hits me tho 🤧
=
i'm crying.. wanna go back to that era, my queens can't be replaced 🖤👑
=
Te re amo 😍😭.
=
This breaks my heart. I can’t imagine the longing she feels whenever she performs. It must have hurt her deeply.
=
목소리 너무 조흠 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Red hair really suits her. 💕
=
She wonnin my heart, MV PLEASE
=
Omg i'm crying
=
진짜...봄 목소리는 그 때 투애니원을 알았고, 그들 노래를 한번쯤 불러봤던 사람이라면 듣자마자 울컥하게 되는 그런 목소리다... 오래오래 하고싶은 만큼 노래했으면 좋겠다..
=
Mds referência as meninas do 2ne1! Quando vi os microfones delas, que vontade de chorar ;-;
=
I wish that CL would have watched this....
=
Miss you 2NE1 😭
=
The real Queen 💚💙
=
여왕인 줄 알았다.....박봄이 박봄했다
=
다른 투애니원 멤버분들도 이영상 보셨겠지?ㅠㅠ진짜 눈물난다 투애니원 완전체 무대 존버합니다..
=
Did y'all notice those mics?! Those are 2ne1's!!!!!!!
=
love you bom, really love this performance
=
너무 수고 많았어 사랑해 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ💛🧡💛🧡💛
=
The four microphones... When I heard this song for the first time I inmediately thought about 2NE1 and how hard must be for her to be alone from now on. Bom, you did great and we're very proud of you. I don't care if you win or not, I'm gonna stay by your side and support you no matter what ♡
=
I hope that bom performs this song at mama :(
=
I cry a lot when I watch this video. Park Bom, we miss you so much. 2NE1, we love you so much...
=
Her voice is so beautiful
=
I think this the comeback, the lyrics tell it all.
=
After everything bom has gone through she's still thriving and slaying us with everything she does, I'll never stop supporting my queen
=
박봄님은 논란이 많고 그 부분에서 이해가 안가는게 많지만 진심 2ne1 이라는 자기 그룹에 대한 사랑은 진짜 모두가 인정해야할거같아..
=
마이크 네 개가 진짜... 진짜 울컥하네요.
=
3:26 절규....뒤에 안무....ㅠㅠ
=
The 2ne1 microphones
=
i beg all blackjacks & bombshell please vote for her on mama2019 her ranking is low. she deserves on mama stage please
=

CL Bom Dara Minzy
The Fab Four girls that made it too big
My loves <3
=
0:22 there's 2 of her?!
=
지금 알았는데 왜 박봄 저 머리 했지? 라고 생각했는데 투애니원 마지막 마마무대에 저 머리 색함...
=
돌려보내줘ㅜㅜㅜ 애타게울잖아ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
That made me so emo
=
Crying😭😭😭❤️
=
Her confidence is screaming! It's like she's telling everybody that 2NE1 is in her and that she'll continue to fight....👑✨❤️⭐
=
*we all miss 2ne1*

*bom also misses 2ne1*

*we all wanna go back*

*she also wanna go back*
=
2ne1다시 합치면 좋겠다 진짜ㅠㅠ
=
Bom is such a beautiful person!
=
1:58  4명 나와서 춤출때  눈물 날뻔
=
She is the only reason why i watch queendom and now i cry so much after watching her this performance...
=
마이크 봉 4개있는거.
노래랑 박봄이랑 너무 잘맞아서 더 슬퍼.
돌아가고싶어.
네가 너무 그리워.
=
❤QUEEN❤
=
봄아!
내가 너를 처음 뮤직비디오로 만난 것이 2011년 6월이다.
내 나이 50살이며 군 생활 29년을 하고 있던 시점이었다.
내가 K-POP에 처음으로 관심을 갖기 시작할 무렵이다.
2NE1(박봄, 산다라, CL, 공민지)! 너희들을 생각하면 가슴이 아프다.
그토록 열정적이고 음악을 계속하고 싶어 했는데...
지금까지 활동했다면 걸그룹의 BTS가 될 수도 있었는데.
참으로 아쉽구나!
그 꿈이 물거품처럼 사라졌으니 얼마나 실망했겠느냐?
봄아!
비록 너의 잘못이 일부 있지만 그렇다고 자책은 하지 말렴.
언젠가 모두 모여 공연하는 날이 올 것이라 믿는다.
비록 지금은 각자의 삶을 살고 있지만 연락은 하고 지내렴.
그리고 너의 자리에서 최선을 다해라!
언젠가 모두 함께하는 미래를 기대하자!


Bom!
I met you in the music video for the first time in June 2011.
It was when I was 50 years old and had been in the army for 29 years.
It's around the time I first got interested in K-pop.
2NE1 (Park Bom, Sandara, CL, Gong Min-ji)!
It hurts to think of you guys.
You guys were so passionate, so eager to continue your music...
If you've been active, you could have been a BTS member of a girl group. What a pity!
How disappointed would you be that the dream had vanished like a bubble?
Bom!
Even though you have some mistakes, let's not blame ourselves.
I believe there will come a day when everyone will get together and perform.
Although we are living each other's lives now, keep in touch.
And do your best in your seat!
Let's look forward to a future where we will all be together someday!
=
I cried like turtle watching this T-T
=
봄이언니 너무 멋지다👍❤️❤️

무대해석
1. 박봄 빨간머리 = 투애니원 마지막무대 mama 에서 했던머리

2. 백댄서들 의상 = 투애니원 마지막무대 mama 의 멤버들 의상

3. 멤버별 색깔 스탠딩 마이크

4. 마지막 춤 + 밑에 반짝거리는 천막
투애니원 첫번째 미니앨범 in the club 앨범커버와 안무


+) 베댓된김에 yg시절때 쓰던 초록색마이크 소속사나올때 yg가 안줘서 박봄이 직접 초록색으로 커스텀함
=
She’s filling memories to 2ne1 members and fans. 
She’s really tough and she’s not even competing but i salute of her bravery to stand on stage again and make us finally fill a piece.
=
Her hair make me back to "can't nobody" mv
=
Omg.. My blackjack heart.. The mic colour... Park Bom you are really sincerely idol I never met.. The one who think her member not just a coworker.. Omg 2ne1 deserve to be alive again😭😭
=
Park bom voice is amazing really
=
투애니원이 아직까지 있어서 같이 퀸덤에 나왔으면 어땠을까 ㅜㅜ 씨엘 프로듀스 능력으로 다른 그룹들 못지않게 엄청 멋진 걸 많이 보여줄 수 있었겠지... 박봄 후배들이랑 같이 있으면서 진짜 좋으면서 동시에 많이 슬펐겠다. 다른 그룹들이 함께 웃고 울면서 같이 하는거 보면서 투애니원 생각 얼마나 많이 났을까... 같이 축하하고 웃으면서도 많이 외로웠을듯
=
Although I think it is unfair that bom joined this competition, I am somehow glad she did because we get songs like these that makes me cry and moments of her missing 2ne1. I know she misses them but I am glad that she doesn't seem like they never existed.
=
MY QUEEEEEEN!!!!! OHMYGOOOOOD!!!! I LOVE YOU PARK BOM!!!! 😍😘💖
=
Wtf this is so heart breaking I wanna cryyyyyyyy
=
I Stan you 2ne1 and mamamoo unnie , fighting 😭😭
=
CL done her part to tell everyone that she loves 2NE1, Dara also always talk about 2NE1, since Queendom Started Bom always reminds us how she misses to perform with her group and in the finale she uses costumes,mics,red hair and also how the stage is designed and done. Minzy teases that she will be the next to have a move to show to everyone that she is not the real reason why 2NE1 disbanded and i hope she do something related to her former group and then i hope they will be reunited and perform together😍❤️
=
나 울어요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
언니 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ

진짜 너무 멋지고 잘했어요 

혼자만 있는 무대도 잘 해쳐나가는 게 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ

울 언니 최고👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻

당신이 블랙젝이 영원한 별이요 🖤
=
Her voice and emotion in Stage 😭😭
Love you our queen ♥️♥️
Blackjacks let us vote Park Bom in MAMA2019 for the Best in Vocal Performance Solo.
Our Queen deserve it.
Park Bom in Mama2019
=
노래만 보면 이게 일등이다 개좋아 ㅠㅜ 아련미 ㅜㅜ
=
This is a TRUE tribute to 2NE1
=
마이크 색깔은 퉤니원 멤버 색이고 옛날 박봄 목소리가 난 엄청 그리웠는데 난 너무 좋음. 혼자서 무대를 채워줘서 고마울 따름
=
💔😭 I miss 2ne1. Thank you for this great performance Bom.
=
I dreaded and stalled watching this stage for so long because i knew id be a mess after it ... And i was right , fk u queen for maling me cry
=
My heart breaks for Park Bom, we really need 2Ne1 back
=
I cried through and through. I can't stop replaying it and crying. I respect her so much.
=
대부분 노래가 처음엔 약하게 뒤로 가면서 세게 치고 마무리 짓는데 이 노래는 박봄의 음색때문일까, 2NE1에 대한 간접 기억때문일까 처음부터 웋부짓는거같음ㅜㅠ 멜로디도 미쳤지만 그 뒤 가사에 대해 자신의 진심과 정말 과거로 돌아가길 소망하지만 자기자신도 불가능하다는걸 안다는....그래서 이렇게 노래할 수 밖에 없다는.. 진짜 울부짖음이 느껴짐...목소리에 눈물이 차있는 느낌
=
차례로 금색 마이크 씨엘, 보라색 마이크 공민지, 빨간색 마이크 산다라 박..진짜 눈물 날 뻔했다ㅜㅜ
=
This is extremely beautiful <3 !!!
=
All of her heart is always 2ne1 😭
=
I LOVE YOU BOM! 💋
=
When she referenced Goodbye, it hit harder.
=
봄 사랑해 행복해 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
This song makes me so sad and happy at the same time .
=
근데 나 진짜로 진짜 박봄이 누군지 모르고 있었음ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
최고의무대
=
I Hate MNet for not letting the international fans to vote
=
estan los microfonos de 2ne1 omg no estoy llorando
=
박봄 싫어서 하는말아닌데 마지막 퍼포먼스 좀 웃기닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ  가만히 서있어서 감정잡아도 진짜 이쁠것같은데
=
왜 눈물나지... ㅜㅜ...
=
인더클럽!
In the club!
=
M-net is a troll like YG.
they didn't appreciate real talent.
=
OMG I CRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIED SO MUCH
=
Who's still want the blackjacks coming 🔙  
👍👍👍👍
=
What I find so amazing about this performance too is that YG silenced 2NE1 from speaking about the disbandment. Park Bom is finally able to get the closure she needed and to finally express how difficult everything had been after their disband through this performance <3 I’m a proud black jack and am hoping for a reunion please!
=
Since the final, I have been playing this all day long, everyday 🎥🎞📸💜💚🧡💛
=
투애니원이 너무 그립다 향수를 일으키는 곡... 투애니원의 노래를 듣던 그때가 그리워지는...
=
she really loves her friends :((
=
진짜 박봄님 노래 들을때마다 너무 슬프고 감동적이었어요....글구 예전 2NE1 을 저도 잘 몰랐지만 이 방송만 보더라도 멤버들을 그리워하는게 많이 보여서 재결합 부디 잘되서 대박 났음 좋겠어요. 성량 음색 대박이에요
=
2ne1 너무 보고싶어 양현석 개씨키ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
Those microphones. She didn't have to hurt me this bad 😭💔
=
순위는 비록 높지않았지만, 유앤아이때 합창단쓰고 한 커버했을때 치타랑 합동무대도 봄쩡 허수아비 커버도 팬도라때
눈코입 무대 때 현대무용콜라보 연출 그리고  이번 컴백음원까지  모든게 
최고의무대였습니다. 앞으로도 좋은무대 많이보고싶어요.
=
I see bom make a gestur like 2 and 1, its mean like 2ne1 i think
=
we <3 u bom!
=
watching this video has become my daily habit hahaha
=
若い時のボムの姿に見える
=
박봄 목소리는 진짜 독보적이다. 노래를 잘부르고 재밋게 부름. 언니 노래 오랫동안 불러요. 60살에 언니 콘서트가면 진짜 재밋겟다
=
봄아,...고마워ㅜ
=
2019년 12월 10일 6 PM "첫눈" 기다리며 <33 첫눈까지 빌보드 월드 디지털 챠트에 리스팅 되길 기대해봐요. 올해 리스팅된 다섯곡과 오르지 못한 나머지 곡들을 보면 첫눈은 글로벌 팬덤이 원하는 스타일은 아니지만 ... 박봄과 산다라박의 듀엣 콜라보라는 특별함이 기대를 뛰어 넘는 호응을 얻어낼지도 "첫눈" 티저는 여기 https://vod.melon.com/video/detail2.htm?mvId=50213126&menuId=71030102
=
She really is a queen!
=
Do you notice the mics! Its the mic of 2ne1! I miss my queens😭😭keep strong 2ne1 and please give us comeback..

When i was young, i dance to their music especially fire but not knowing them..until i was high school and we have a kpop dance cover project..and i search for it..tooo late i didnt get to know them before they disband..but still love this queens and always support them in the indi careers
=
마지막 바닥이며 춤이며 인더클럽이잖아 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ랙잭이들은 딱알지 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
TRUE WINNER of Queendom.. Sorry not sorry.. She deserves more than she has now..
=
눈물난다 진짜 ㅠㅠ
=
😭😭😭😭
my blackjack heart♠♥♣♦
=
She dedicated this to 2ne1.
=
봄언니 춤 못추는건 여전하구나. 기다렸어. 일등이 아니어도 뭐 어때. 언니는 내 인생의 가장 큰 추억인걸
=
I;m cried while playing the minzy's video. very very very Surprised me. I cry so hard. I miss them So mush 2NE1 TToTT

She sung amazingly. I just wish she didn’t cover up her beauty with heavy makeup.
=
I wanna cry 😢 2ne1 forever ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
퀸 박 봄 ! ㅠㅠㅜㅠ 눈물 줄줄이다
=
아 눈물날거같다 ㅠㅠ 투애니원 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
진짜 박봄은 박봄이구나
=
We can really see and know the story of her song 💛

#2NE1Forever
=
ㅠㅠ슬프다ㅠ
=
허수아비, 눈코입, 되돌돌, 한 모아 음반 만들어 달라는 부탁은 무리일까요 ㅠ 이런게 기술적으로 가능한지는 저는 모르지만 감성적인 부탁.
=
솔직히 박봄 팬은 아닌데 이 노래는 너무 슬프다.
박봄은 딱 보면 사람이 따뜻해서 약해보이던데... 정신적으로 건강한 사람들은 모르겠지만 나도 일주일에 한 번씩 두통이 너무 심하게 와서 신경안정제 없으면 못 사는데.. 
그래서 처음 그 문제 터졌을 때에도 사람들이 너무 욕하는데 마음이 좀 착잡했다. 진짜 아파보지 않은 사람은 모를 감정인데.. 아직 정신과와 관련된 과학의 진보는 너무도 미미하고, 내 일상을 집어삼키는 끔찍한 두통의 원인은 아직 그 누구도 발견 못하고 매주 고통받고있는 사람 입장에서... 박봄이 이해가 됐다. 요즘 우울증과 약, 정신과에 대해 한국의 관심이 많이 느는 중이던데, 그나마 다행이라고 생각함.. 
어쨋든 앞으로 잘됐으면 좋겠다. 투애니원을 그리워하고 있는 게 느껴져서 퀸덤 보는 내내 마음이 안 좋았다..
=
the amount of references in this performance
=
She is legend.. and the most brave queen, and look at her , fighting alone in her stage without her group.. . U r so amazing unnie.fightinh 💓
=
제목부터 설마했는데...스탠딩 마이크 4개 보고 눈물났다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I cried... I miss 2ne1 so much...
=
헐 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 어떡해 진짜 이번무대 너무 간절하고 공감되고 슬프다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 이거 진짜 너가 아니라 2ne1말하는거잖아 ㅜㅠㅠ
=
I'M CRYING
=
I too wanna go back. “What’s up we 21!”
=
노래 진짜 너무 좋은데.. 마지막 춤 나만 웃겼음?ㅎㅎ
=
I'M CRYING

=
박봄 오랫동안 노래해줬으면 좋겠다. 목소리 진짜 독보적임..

=
Can someone just put them together again. Or can we have one last tour? I miss them. SO MUCH.
=
난2ne1다시 보고 싶다
되돌리도~~~
=
언니 최고에요 ♥♥역시 박봄!!!!
=
박붐은 언제나 열정적이고 진지해서 좋아!
=
뭔가 인어공주가 거품이 되어버릴때 왕자를 처음좋아하던때를 기억하며 부르는 노래같다...
=
진짜 유니크하다
=
Why i cant stop crying......

=
ADELE OF SOUTH KOREA

I wish she had been the one that won
=
This made me cry.
=
와.. 마이크 스탠딩 4개..
=
민지가 영상편지 해준거보면서 완전체 기대감이 높아졌다ㅠㅠ 순위가 낮았지만 그래도 퀸덤을통해서 팬들에게 자기가 할수있는거 보여주고 또 인스타라이브하면서 팬들에게 들려주고싶은거 소통하면서 해주는거보면서 팬찐사랑을 보여줬지 춘여사만 즐거웠으면 됐고 하고싶은거 했으면됐다 퀸덤에 나와줘서 정말 고마웠고 노래 또 듣고싶지만 목이 많이 안좋은것같아서 휴식취하고 또 좋은 노래 들려줬으면 좋겠어 춘여사ㅠㅠ
=
Who did his drees?

Just do it...!! I always by yours side,girls!
My Queens...my youth ❤️🤟2NE1
=
*VOCAL QUEEN*
=
2ne1 일때가 최고 컴백 다시 합치길..
=
She dropped the headphones tho she killed the high notes like they're nothing
=
음색 성량 미쳤다 걍
=
박봄 마지막댄스...뇌리에 너무 오랫동안 남는다. 인상적이야~ 춤의 완성도가 아니라 춤에 녹아있는 박봄이라는 가수의 인생관
=
I KEEP WATCHING THIS AND I STILL BURST INTO TEARS
=
She deserves to win
Her vocals are everything
Her strength.
You are the best
=
Damn. I am crying. Literally crying. I can’t deal. Park Bom has so much emotion on her vocals. I am sorry if she doesn’t win idk what people are doing.
=
Ngak ada yg bisa mengantikan 2ne1!!!
2ne1 forever❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
마이크 2ne1때랑 똑같은 색깔아니여??ㅠㅜㅜ
=
스탠딩 마이크 진짜ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
의상이랑 색깔까지 맞췄네 개찡해
=
I’m so sad now :(
=
저기 놓여있는 마이크 세개가 다라 씨엘 민지가 무대에서 쓰는 마이크색깔 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
When I want to cry, I just play this video, the lyrics, the video, the power and the feeling that Park Queen Bom puts in every sentence, step and note, it just makes me burst into tears 
Love You Bommie ❤❤
=
Mano, eu quase chorei assistindo 
Muito emocionante, muito mesmo
=
I need lyrics 😆😘💕💞
=
i cried along Watching boom performance. .2ne1 love you forever
=
계속 다른 무대 한 번 보고 다시 이 영상으로 돌아옴 ,,, 진짜 여운 제일 짙은 무대는 봄 언니 무대인듯 ,,, 가슴 먹먹해지고 진짜 계속 보러 오게 됨 ㅠㅠ
=
아름다운 박봄님 화이팅입니다!! ❤️
=
Everytime i saw her on screen how i wish she still with 2ne1 that they would still perform. I always cry whenever i remember how painful it was to think that they already disband.
=
저거 어떻게 한거지 보면서도 신기해함 알려주실분
=
QUEEN OF KPOP
=
Other stages might have been flashier and had more stage action. However this is the only song I find myself coming back to, listening again and again     Queen Bom👑💚
=
What's up!We're 2NE1!!
=
Wanna too get back 😭😭 😭
=
That Mic drop tho
=
I also wanna go back...
=
Ok but still this didn't deserve last place, I'm still pissed
=
パクボムかっこいいなーーーー(^_-)-☆
=
A días de que mi reina regrese ❣️
#PARKBOMQUEEN
=
holy fucki cried when i saw their mics
=
I listen this song everyday♥️ the perfect ending for her Queendom journey 🙏🏼✨
=
진짜 옛날에 투애니원이 탑이였을 때가 있었는데 그때 생각나서 보면서 계속 울었네.. 제발 CL 와이지 나와서 네명에서 다시 나와줬으면 좋겠다...
=
miss you 2ne1 :(
=
I want 2ne1 back ,,, 😭 still can't move on
=
눈물이 나지! 사랑해요~
=
1.3M views in just 2 days. it's crush era once again
=
The only final performance that touched my heart and gave me goosebumps... 
Her voice has pain that she's been through... 
She fell, criticized, despised and hurt numerous times.. ..  but picked herself up, dusted herself and stepped in the battlefield again gaining confidence everyday.. Hatsoff Park Bom ... I support U...
=
Goosebumps
=
퀸덤 나와줘서 너무 고마운 박봄
=
Watching this with tears
=
봄언니 돌아가지 않아도 지금을 살면 돼요. 어떤 것도 예전과 같을 순 없을거예요 하지만 지금을 다시 만들어가다보면 언젠가 함께 만나 웃을 기회도 생길거라고 생각해요. 박봄 너무 멋있고 죽지 않고 여전하구나 생각했어요. 이번 마지막 무대 카리스마 있고 박봄스러워서 좋았어요. 앞으로 더 더 원래의 멋지고 자신감 충만한 박봄으로 활약해주세요💕
=
그러고보니깐 저 마이크 색깔 다 멤버들 색이네...
=
4개 마이크 색깔 다 다른 디테일...
=
QUEEN!!!
=
She is the true definition of QUEEN,
After all they've went thru, for the love of music and their fans, she doesn't give up.
THAT'S A TRUE QUEEN FOR ME.
💜💜💜👏👏👏
=
이번 무대 진짜... 가사도 그렇고 마이크 색깔들도 그렇고 가사 중 “너 너 너” 세명 딱 얘기하는데...하ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
this was such a beautiful and touching tribute to 2ne1 and blackjacks ❤
=
눈물 일리터 흘렸다 진짜
=
인이어 계속 빠지는데ㅠㅠ
=
Queen💕
=
*I wanna turn back time, I wanna go back*

When she sang that line, dang freaking tears can't stop falling.
=
마이크 나머지 멤버들꺼 다 꽂혀있어ㅠㅠ 투에니원..
=
Queen❤❤❤❤
=
She literally made me break up in tears and broke my hearts twice into a hundred thousand pieces. I'm crying, because she's the nost precious person ever. Love u Park Bom 💕 2ne1 FOREVER
=
i wanna go back ..to time that 2ne1 is still famous ..strong..fAntastic..
i miss them..i cry a lot. when watching this..
#QUEEN
=
This is what a real singer looks like! 💙
=
아니 진짜 눈물나,,,
2NE1 완전체 보고싶다 ,,,,
=
I miss 2ne1 :(
=
im trying not to cry, but when those 3 dancers came out on stage representing CL, DARA, and MINZY. i want to go back to those days too.
=
This kind of broke my heart. Such a powerful performance. She doesn't have to win Queendom, she's already a winner to me. Stay strong, unnie!
=
IM CRYING HWAAA
=
Legend
=
Oh god... I need to see them on same stage
=
Queen👑❤️
=
Kpop fans are toxic. That’s why you can’t have nice things. Basically the moral of this story.
=
노래도 좋고 라이브도 너무 좋네요 역쉬 봄이 언니 어디 안갔군요
=
I watch Queendom because there was Park Bom and for me she is always the winner. It's her passion that inspires me a lot. She deserves so much better than this.  " If we can't turn back the time, let's walk together till the end of the road "
=
염색 색상 뭐에요??? 짱예뿌다ㅏ..
=
박봄만 나오면 왜케 뭉클한겨.. 미치겄네😞
=
Those mic belongs too :
Gold - CL❤
Purple - MINZY🌹
orange - DARA.🍁

#2NE1ONMAMA2019
=
2ne1엄청 좋아했던 팬으로써 이 노래 볼때마다 먹먹해진다 퀸덤 찍는동안 혼자 얼마나 외롭고 멤버들한테 기대고싶었을까 슬프다 진짜
=
That was a whole serve
=
I miss 2ne1😔😔 parkbom comeback fighting❤️❤️💪💪💪 forever❤️❤️❤️
=
여러분 이번 MAMA때 퍼포먼스 보컬 솔로로 박봄나와요! 후보자가 벤(180도),첸( 사월이 지나면 우리 헤어져요),장범준(노래방에서),박봄(봄),태연(사계),김재환(안녕하세요) 이렇게 후보에 오르는데 박봄뽑아주세요! 많은분들 보실수있게 좋아요 눌러주시면 감사하구요
=
she has 4 mic on the the stage.. which represents the members of 2ne1.. can't they just be together again..
=
Awesome 💜
=
봄 언니 무댈 보고 어떻게 안울어...
=
포켓몬 하면 사천왕중에 저렇게 아우라 넘치는 캐릭이 좋았는데.....
=
It makes me so emotional to see such a meaningful performance. The pain that she felt is shown in the performance and it is clear that the way she and the other members were treated still have a huge impact on her. #2ne1forever
=
I miss 2ne1！
=
BEST VOCAL PERFORMANCE
=
꼭 다시 뭉쳤으면 좋겠다 2ne1해체 스토리 들은적은 없어도 멤버끼리의 불화는 절대 아닐듯 다들 너무 잘났고 잘나가서 불화일 수 없지 ㅠㅠ 개같은 약국
=
Eu nem sou do fandom e chorei, puts😔
=
Mano,so vi referencias incriveis ao 2ne1 no debut,no MAMA caralho Park boom sempre foda no que faz.Ainda tenho esperanças ao 2ne1 voltar.
=
3:52 !!!!!
=
Im maybe cant be flexible like in the old time but my voice and my soul are always dedicated to music
=
Omg, im gonna cry. The dance moves and the dancers' outfits are literally tribute to 2ne1. Love it!
=
이때 박봄 이니어 빠져있었음..ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 근데 이렇게 고음을 잘내다니......박봄이 1등안한건 말이안된다
=
Awesome stage performance :D
=
i want more park bom! bring back 2ne1!
=
늘 함께했던 너 너 너 하면서 세번 가르키는게 민지 다라 채린이를 의미하는거 같네요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 돌아와죠 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
노래 목소리가 매력있네요 좋은 노래많이 불러주세🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤
=
그 베에엠~~~!
=
Watch this again n again, n im crying again n again...really miss to see them on stage together😭

#blackjack forever #2ne1♥️
=
that 4 mic stands tho 😭😭😭 she wanna go back so much
=
To her.... 2ne1 is her everything.. and it makes me hurt so much.. pls someone bring 2ne1 back..
=
타팬이지만 솔직히 난 박봄님 무대가 너무 기억에 남는다,,,노래와 음색 그리고 무대가 그냥 진짜 어떤 감정을 담고 부르는지 느껴져서 보는데 눈물 나와서 당황함,,,너무 멋졌어요
=
i love you😭
=
Dang... raw emotion and the feels. Her raw emotion can be heard in this song. I cried while watching. I cried while listening and reading the comments. 

But let's face it. To win in this kind of competition, you have to be sooooo popular and have a large fanbase. Everyone in Queendom is talented. They all have their own color. They don't need a competition to show who's better. They are all queens in their own right. So, who cares in the end who won? Park Bom is saying what she wants. Queens come and go, but like her and everyone in 2ne1 they are Legends.
=
듣다 울음...아 멤버 다시 무대에 서게 해주세요
=
I love Blackjackees so much <3 !!! ^^
=
The set had problem...That wasn’t the first time@@But it didn’t effect her
=
Keep streaming
=
퀸덤보고 열광하는사람들대부분이 중딩들이라 2ne1을 자세히 모르고 박봄무대를 그냥 무대로만 봐서 아쉬울뿐... 2ne1세대인 내가 봤을땐 단번에 멤버들 그리워하는곡이고 무대도 2ne1 다른멤버들 상징하는거 단번에알아쳐렸는데..... 정말 공들인 무대임을 알수가있다 ㅠ
=
i love you bom always ❤ i love you all my 2ne1 my very first love queens ❤👑
=
Seriously, despite not understanding Korean, this performace brought me to tears. I badly miss 2NE1 and I just wanna see them come back in one stage. I can feel Bom's struggles and how she misses 2NE1. She's against other powerful, popular and younger groups; however she never quit. Not for herself, but for 2NE1. I hope she moves forward and be stronger. 

I have never stanned any other groups... but if they got a chance to do a reunion concert I would throw any thing else I have now just to see them perform live. We love you BOM! We forever love 2NE1!


PS: It would be fair if they just get all soloists in Queendom, or just all girl groups. This is not fair for Bom. Yet, she gave a legendary stage. She's still number 1 for me here, 2nd is G-idle, then Mamamoo. Don't get me wrong, every group did very well.
=
마지막 춤빼면 완벽한 무대였다 👍
=
now let season 2 happen and put top ggs in it..lets see if they can outdo s1 performances..lol..jk..just.wanna.see.them.interact..
=
Who's slicing all these onions?
=
Lloré cuando vi los demás micrófonos.
=
2ne1's disbanment is a drama, it's tragic.
The girls were and they still are really heartbroken.
I am crying with them.
=
Song is so good!
=
The writers of this song really knows 2ne1 and park Bom's story very well and the references from 2NE1's songs like "Goodbye" and "if I were you"
=
퀸덤 시즌 2 가자.
=
OUR QUEEN HAS RISEN. THAT'S THE RESULT OF THIS SHOW. PARK BOM IS FINALLY BACK. CAN'T STOP CRYING CUZ OF THE MICS AND THE MESSAGE OF THIS PERFORMANCE 😭❤️
=
맨 마지막에 무대 올라가고 뭔가 열심히 춤추는 모습이, 4명일때가 그립고 지금은 혼자지만 잘 하려고 애쓰고 있다는 의미로 느껴져서 마음아프다....ㅠㅠ
=
I cried....oh god, bom....i missed 2ne1
=
언니 노래하는 모습 너무 멋져요 아름다워요😭 사랑해요👩‍❤️‍👩👩‍❤️‍👩👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
=
cara, park bom sente muita falta das meninas :/ força, meu amor <3
=
I fcking cried. My blackjack heart. Its always never the same without them on the scene 💔
=
🔥🔥🔥🔥
=
외국 팬들도 2ne1이 돌아오기를 기다리는듯...돌아와 제발~~~
=
I WILL FOREVER STAN YOU AND THE REST OF 2NE1 💖💖💖
=
THE VOICE OF K-POP
=
When i saw the mic, I was expecting for Minzy, Dara, and CL to come out
=
Bom 💖💖💖💖😭😭😭😭
=
우리남편에  유일한가수 투애니원!!아직도 아침알람이 투애니원노래 언제나 박봄 화이팅이에요~~
=
Park bom didnt need to win because shes already a queen
=
이거보면서 예전 박봄영상 뒤져봤는데.. 예전박봄보면서 예전이 더예쁘긴했는데.. 요즘박봄은 행복해보인다
=
마이크ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 투애니원 멤버들이 쓰던 마이크ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 눈물버튼 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
계속 생각나는 노래 ㅠㅠ
=
her mic :(
=
I want 2ne1 back 😥
=
Those high notes gave me goosebumps❤❤❤😗😘😍
=
PLEASE VOTE PARK BOM IN MAMA2019 EVERYDAY!!!!
=
항상 1위를 하고 항상 그룹으로 있는게 익숙했을거에요. 하지만 원치않게 홀로 무대를 서게되고 후배들과 경쟁하면서 하위권 등수를 가지게됐음에도 항상 매번 무대에 최선을 다하는 모습을 보고 정말 뭉클했어요. 앞으로도 이렇게 노래해주시길 바래요. 박봄 화이팅❤❤❤
=
I misss 2ne1 so much
I love you boomiee
=
I lost my way
길을 잃은 아이처럼
can you find my way?
빛을 비춰줘 나의

내일이 어둡지 않게 
쓰러져 버리지 않게
I don’t wanna be alone
please don’t let me go

(그리워해요 난
우리의 마지막 날)

그 "안녕"이란 말에
숨어 울었던 그 밤

되돌릴 수 없는, 돌아갈 수 없는,
돌아갈 곳 없는, 너에게로 난
되돌리고 싶어 돌아가고 싶어
늘 함께였던 너 너 너가 너무 그리워
난 wanna go back

어느새 추워져 버린
창 밖은 마치 꼭 내 맘과 같은데

여기 나 홀로 희미해져 가는 널 붙잡고
단 한 번만 이라도 딱 하루만 이라도
돌아가고 싶어

(그리워해요 난
우리의 마지막 날)

그 "안녕"이란 말에
숨어 울었던 그 밤

되돌릴 수 없는, 돌아갈 수 없는
돌아갈 곳 없는, 너에게로 난
되돌리고 싶어 돌아가고 싶어
늘 함께였던 너 너 너가 너무 그리워
난 wanna go back

나 여기 있을게 네가 돌아오는
그날 그때를 기다리면서

되돌릴 수 없는, 돌아갈 수 없는
돌아갈 곳 없는, 너에게로 난
되돌리고 싶어 돌아가고 싶어
늘 함께였던 너 너 너가 너무 그리워
난 wanna go back

Oh Oh Oh Oh 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 
Oh Oh Oh Oh 
Oh Oh Oh Oh
=
my blackjack heart 🖤🖤🖤🖤

i wish CL would join her company.. they can do better ❤️❤️❤️
=
the history behind this performance is so sad , I wasn't a fan but I understand the references of 2NE1. She did an amazing performance, I want to cry. She won the heart of the fans
=
너 너 너가 그리워... 투애니원 멤버 세명 같아서 슬프다
=
I REALLY WISH WE COULD TURN BACK TIME AND STILL HAVE 2NE1. I REALLY MISS THEM. IT HURTS SO BAAAD
=
Wow like she came back with fire am really proud of her 
We love bom no matter what
=
박봄 잘됐으면 좋겠다 개인적으로...
=
She dance IN THE CLUB choreagraphy at the end and “Oh Oh” also is the lyrics of that song too. I miss them all !!!!
=
Why am i crying? Huhu my blackjack heart. 🍏🍊🍇🍋
=
Love you Bommie. Missing 2NE1 😢😢😢
=
I'm not crying. I'm crying. I miss them so much. I want to see them again someday, in one stage. Singing and performing like there's no tomorrow. I miss My real, Queens😭 ❤ 
Come back home, 2EN1.
=
되 돌려줘라 저렇게 간절한데 지금 2ne1 나오면 다 씹어먹는다
=
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ아진짜 마이크 세개 놓인거 너무슬퍼ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
장기간 고생하셨습니다.
=
When she says "you were always beside me" and points to three places 💔
=
We always wait 2NE1. If they come back,we will bless and welcome.
=
박봄 씨가 좋아해요
=
투애니원도 유명하니까 대표곡 몇개 아는게 전부고 관심도 딱히 없었어서 박봄 서사 잘 아는것도 아닌데도 무대 보면서 눈물 찔끔 흘림...레전드 무대👍
=
Девочки, нет я не плачу, это просто слезы💖
=
처음에 이 노래 들었을때 박봄님의 투애니원 멤버들을 지칭하는 걸 앎.. 투애니원이 나왔을때는 내가 어릴 때라서 잘 몰랐는데 알게하는..
=
아..빈마이크3개..전멤버들자리의미하는거 맞죠?슬퍼라ㅜㅜ멤버들에게 받치는 노랜가봐여..ㅠ
=
마이크 스탠드 4개에 투애니원 커스텀 마이크 색인 것 같은데...소름
=
거울 퍼포먼스부터 투애니원 멤버들의 마이크랑 빈자리, 댄서들의 의상, 되돌돌 가사까지 다 무엇을 뜻하는지 바로 알 거 같아서 너무 감동적이었음 되돌돌은 봄의 진심이 가장 담겨있는 노래라고 했는데 진짜 무대에서 그게 너무 느껴져서 진짜 눈물만 뚝뚝 흘림ㅠㅠ 또 얼마나 힘들었을까 생각하면 또 눈물이 나고... 진짜 무대 중에서 가장 감동적인 무대였던 것 같음 이제 봄이에게도 따듯한 봄이 왔으면
=
the fashion stylist for Bom should make her clothes simpler, not much bling bling and jewelries... she's pretty enough... focus some clothes that are easy to handle and not too high heels... and pls make sure her earpiece is secured
=
Like every blackjacks I just miss them all...😭😭😭 But happy to see them individually keep on moving. Hope one day they will reunite again all.
=
눈감고 듣고 있으면 영어같다 ..
=
마이크 4개 너무 맴찢
=
I CAN'T HOLD MY TEARS WHEN I SAW THE 4 MIC COLORS😭😭😭😭
=
Bring back 2ne1 pls 😣😭
=
한국에 있을 뮤지션이 아니다~~♡
=
So much feels in this song OMG ♥️♥️😭😍, she  is a true artist !!  Even with everything that happens to her , she's still fighting back ! Even if she have to do it from the start again 😭👍 
That what I always love about 2ne1 about park bom in particular , authencity,  no lie , no false personally they are themselves !! 
No offense I like kpop , but they have something authentic that only 2ne1 and big bang had (some members at least ) 

So fighting park you're the true winner
=
박봄 노래너무 좋네요
씨엘도 ㅎ
=
Vote Park Bom at Mama 2019 as Best Vocal Performance Solo
=
La Amo, no pude evitar llorar al ver los otros 3 micrófonos 💔, sigue superándose a sí misma, siempre brillando cómo la mágica Estrella que es 🌟
=
She doesn't deserve to be on queendom





She deserves to be where legends perform
=
Go go go QUEEN Bom Park❤
=
I miss 2NE1 so much :((
=
Well, guys, let’s just appreciate that Bommy took a part in this competition and we could enjoy her performances all this time, it’s already a big step for her after hiatus and for us too. 
I was crying and having goosebumps during performance, she nailed it as always, but funny to see her trying to fix earphone back lol
And mic drop was effective end, cuz like Obama she just said I’m done, PERIOD!

It’s hard to win for her after hiatus, and also when other contestants are groups and already having big fanbase, so let’s support her, she made it well🌸🌸🌸
=
3:43
=
😭🖤✨
=
대단하다 최고보컬
=
노래 넘 멋졌어요. 노래 끝쪽에 인이어 빠졌는데 잘안꽂아져서 그냥 부른는 모습 넘 멋졌어요!!
=
I am not a big 2ne1 stan and don't exactly know what kinda relationship they all had together but even me, an outstander, can see, hear and feel the pain she is in. I hope she can move on💕
=
CL and Minzy left their labels, they should both sign with D-nation (bom's label). This would automatically influence dara to leave YG as well, we would have them back, only probably under a different name as petty YG would never sell them 2ne1 copyrights.
=
park bom queen
=
I'm telling y'all I feel like there will gonna be 2NE1 in MAMA 2019 ❤🙏
=
님들.. 3:40 이 부분 2NE1 In the club 안무래여 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ진짜 눈물샘 폭발중ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ제 마음의 1위는 박봄이에요.. 진짜 항상 응원해요ㅠㅠㅠㅜ
=
그립다..퉤니원 ㅜㅜ
=
감동적이다.
=
Alwaaayss boomiee noonaa... my alien boom.. my black jack heart 😥😥😥
=
마지막 파이널 봄이 노래듣고 어렸을때 좋아했던 걸그룹들이 새록새록 생각났는데...진짜 뭔가 그시절이 그리워지게 하는 느낌이라... 들으면서도 눈물이 맺혀지게 됨... 내 최애 걸그룹은 레인보우였는데... 퀸덤에 나왔다면 어땠을까?ㅠㅠ
=
I’m not a Blackjack or a fan of Bom but after seeing all her performance on queendom i definitely became a fan of hers. This song really sends sadness to me. I can feel her because i have also lost people that is very precious to me. I hope she fights bravely and continue to do all her best. I love her so much now.
=
인어공주 우루술라인줄 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
힘내요 ... 간절히 바라는게 느껴지는것 같음 노래에서 ㅎㅎ
=
진짜 박봄 음색은 레전드다
=
Although her earphone dropped, Bom still sang so good❤
=
there’s always going to be some idiot that’s  going to be like “ she is leaching on to 2ne1”.
She literally poured out her soul, and I felt it.
=
Minzy Reported To Have Filed An Injunction To Suspend Contract With Her Agency
=
Sigh this is sad. I just hope bigbang will leave yg and open up their own company then they take 2ne1 back, lee hi, bi and other talented artist!
=
노래가 넘 찡하다ㅡㅠ박봄 초창기 이쁜얼굴 변한듯해 서운하기도하고 부담스럽기도햇엇는데 ‥음색만큼은 짱짱짱!!!투애니원과 함께다시볼수있길
=
Park bom my queen please I didn’t need them I miss 2en1 feels but now I crying like a baby thanks love you
=
노래 미쳤네..박봄 음색에 노래 가사랑 컨셉까지 박봄이 진짜로 느끼는 감정인게 느껴질정도로 확 와닿네
=
무대 위 마이크가 너무 슬퍼
=
I am waiting for the MV T.T
=
My Queen is back <3
=
Hermosa ParkBom I love BOM
=
너, 너, 너 세번.. 멤버들 부르는 것 같아서 울었다
=
Bring back 2ne1 pleeeeeaaaasse...
=
She didn't win but she stole my heart <3 <3
=
goose bumps all over !
=
naiiyak parin tlga ako everytime nakikita and naririnig ko tu huhuhu
=
어린시절 .. 누구나 투에니원을 좋아했던 사람들이 본다면 마음 한편이 찡해지는 그런 무대.. 고음 지르기 전에 인이어 빠졌는데도 시원하게 고음을 질러주는 봄언니 최고.. 아직도 유앤아이, 돈크라이, 투에니원 노래 들으면서 저도 옛날을 그리워해요.. 보고싶네요 투에니원 .. 노래방가면 꼭 부르는 투에니원 노래.. 봄언니 항상 응원합니다 ,, 힘내세요 사랑해요❤️
=
노래 실력으로는 박봄 너가 1등이야. ❤️
=
it made me cry....
=
Im crying so much
=
봄❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
I dont think i've ever heard her singing that high in my entire life we are blessed
=
My interpretation:I feel like she’s trying to say that she wishes she could turn back time and perform and make music earlier but she couldn’t (because of yg) but  she can’t turn back time and she had to wait until she could do this again  , ‘ just for one day ‘ she wants to have us and the stage back and do this again and when she’s says when she had to say goodbye ( disband) all she could do is cry . She also saying she misses her fans and we were always by her side  . About the dancing thing of her ‘twin’ I think she’s saying sorry I couldn’t make music from her feelings and heart   instead of this yg music with these catchy dances because it was just a show for almost a brand and money , she also can’t look at her ‘old self /twin ‘because she doesn’t like it (obviously) and it was not her real self, also pointing out the twin/old self was darker which maybe means she was sad at those times  , and as you can see kind of in the video it’ll never be fully her .she also says she trying to hold on to US (the fans)so basically hoping  we won’t leave here. She can’t go back to us when we were waiting for her and maybe she feels like she wanted time and that’s the reason why she wants to turn back time .
=
인어공주같아
=
This is making cry but idk why but it is this gives me memories of 2NE1 for some reason this performance reminds me of 2NE1...
=
나 운다....
=
와..처음에 거울도 소름이었는데 4명이서 서있는거 진짜 너무소름돋았다..
=
Oh my hearth
=
4 Mics... Oh no, I'm crying.
=
❤️❤️❤️😍
=
봄님 수고했어요!!
=
Me(before reading the lyrics): Crying
Me(after reading the lyrics) : crying like a waterfall
=
Her performances always make me sad because it's obvious that she never moved on from 2NE1. She relied on them for everything, and now that they're gone, she still feels empty. She's doing so well on her own and I hope she stays strong <3
=
In my opinion,Park Bom's voice is the most beautiful in this season. Dont bash me ok.
=
박봄 사랑해
=
You can tell she misses 2NE1 so much, I’m so proud of her for coming back though. Still as amazing as ever!
=
미친.. 마이크 4개는 투애니원 멤버들.. 댄서들 의상은 마지막 공연 의상..
=
가사 곱씹어보면서 들으니까
얼마나 박봄이 그 당시의 yg와 2ne1을 그리워하는지가 느껴진다. 


반오십도 안먹었는데 뭔가 애틋하내요, 학창시절때 fire나 롤리팝등 화려한 무대를 선보이고 
인기가요에서 1위도 하고 큰 무대에 섰었던 말 그대로 아이돌이 
저런식으로 과거를 그리워하는 모습이.
=
그냥 눈물이 막 나와요
=
Escuchan eso?
Es mi corazón rompiéndose en mil pedacitos.
=
I'm crying
=
We need 2NE1 in mama 2019
=
I'm crying
=
Guys.. Don't forget to vote Park Bom for MAMA every day using all your sosial media account.. She been nominated for 3 categories..
=
I'm crying
=
퉤니원 그리워 ..
=
僕が泣いた。😿
ブラーボー　ボムちゃん！#2NE1#BLACKJACK #4EVER
=
So sad for bom!! :( alone
=
This is so meaningful. I'm a 2ne1 fan and I miss them together, how it must be painful for her, that always had the girls to support and give strength. But now she is alone on the stage.... Anyway, we are here for you Boomie... You did amazing!
=
This broke my heart in so many ways
=
The thing she couldn't overcome was her popularity in Korea especially with the new generation. If they had allowed International Fans to participate she would not have finished last. They should have all lady soloists from her generation to  be fair. So maybe Taeyeon, Sunmi, Gummy, Yubin and then for excitement, invite Minzy! Any suggestions?
=
님들 그거 아세요 안무 중간에 투애니원 무대 안무도 있고 백댄서+박봄님 이렇게 총 넷 서있는데 백댄서들 투애니원 다른 멤버들 헤어스타일or복장인거......... 보고 진짜 비명지름진짜........
=
처음 엄청 돌려봤네
=
An emotional song for every blackjacks. I miss the group. 2NE1 was the best, and right now, all I can do is to support them in each of their endeavor.
=
투애니원의 모든 서사를 다 아는 것은 아니지만 지금까지의 퀸덤 그룹의 무대 중에서 가장 기억에 남는 무대였고, 박봄 님의 애절함도 너무 잘 보인 노래라서 나에게만은 이 곡이 가장 퀸이고 킹이다 보면서 계속 눈물만 흘렸던 것 같다 박봄 님 감사합니다 멋진 목소리를 세상에 들려주셔서, 포기하지 않아주셔서. 완전 반했어요... 사랑해요 ❤❤
=
♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
😭😭😟 aku nangis lihat perform nya park bom unnie , jadi kangen 2ne1
=
왜이렇게 슬프냐....
=
goosebumps
=
은갈치가 팔딱거린다길래 한대때림..

팬아니면 정말 모를 떡밥들..
마이크 의상 마지막춤..
=
Mdss QUE MULHER!!
=
2ne1 still alive
=
I missed 2NE1
=
are we not gonna talk about the 3 mics? Who's crying? HUHUHU
=
This is the only song that's giving me chills and goosebumps
=
박봄이 퀸덤에 참가하게된 이유이자 부르고싶었던 노래가 아닐까?  진정한 파이널곡
=
처음에 박봄이랑 똑같이 입고 춤추는 분 누군가요??
=
이 노래 지금도 듣고 있는 사람없겠지?
에이... 설마 없을거야;;
=
bom appreciate 2ne1 so much, same goes to other members, please make the reunion concert happens😢
=
멤버들과 블랙잭을 위한 노래....
=
투애니원 재결합하자 진짜 . ..
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
❤️
=
아무것도 필요없이 노래만 들어도 좋아요~충분히 훌륭하고 사랑받을 자격이 있다는걸 자신이 알길바래요~~박봄 그자체가 멋지니까 이젠 노래만 집중해주시길♡
=
I'm not a 2ne1 fan, but knowing how it ended for them makes me so sad, and watching this makes me so sad for them, and I'm starting to tear up. Poor Bom
=
She's totally back
=
幫忙分享一下各位 這首真的唱到心坎去餒
=
This was a moving/emotional performance. I love Bom and I loved 2NE1....the only error that I see in this performance was that the Dara and CL dancers had the wrong color mics. I think they should of swapped them when they came close to each other but other than that, this was a WELL put together performance. Congratulations to Mamamoo for winning but Park Bom won my heart.
=
혼자인데도 꿋꿋하게
항상 최선을 다한 좋은 무대 보여줘서 고마워요!!!!!!
박봄언니 최고!!!!!❤️
=
IT'S ABOUT 2NE1 HWAAA😭 I get goosebumps when she  show the other mic that 2ne1 use:''''  MISS OUR GIRLS
=
Haha and people said that her voice is damaged and will get damage this is a BIG BITCH SLAP to you 10 years in the music industry and here she is Living and Slayin🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤💚💚💚
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
박봄 진심이 여기까지 전해진다..
=
투애니원 이렇게 서로를 사랑하고 애틋하고 다시 무대 서고 싶어하는데 정말 같이 있게 해주면 안되냐ㅠㅠㅠㅜ 무대보면서 눈물 줄줄
=
Wow 👏👏  park bom  🗣️
=
2ne1 please comeback
=
노래는 여전히 잘하네 미워할수 없는 사람같다 응원할게요
=
감상 ㄱㄱ
=
무대연출이 걍 짱인데 팬들만 알아볼 수 있는 그런거라 모르는 사람들은 공감을 못한듯...ㅜ
=
Plz bom-ah change the stylist !
=
한보다 이게 더좋다..
=
OMG I cried while watching this performance 😭😭😭
=
Park Bom's voice is her biggest weapon. She has successfully proven her real value in this show. Park Bom is not just a vocalist of 2ne1 but also one of the renowned female singers in K pop world. Someone may deny her  efforts but not for her distinctive voice.  That's Park Bom we have always known
=
Its like shes in MAMA 2019👑
=
I luv u park bom!!
=
2NE1 ... come back please.
=
1:56 the stage refer to 2NE1's stage , the four members😢
=
the girls were dressed to look like the others in 2ne1 too
=
That last part when she was like:
Throw mic and... ¡Pose!

Yeeeeeeeess!
=
봄언니 사랑해요
=
존나 눈물난다 ㄹㅇ..
=
syit im crying
=
True winner❤ always a winner in our hearts😘❤❤❤❤
=
제일 놀랐던부분은 박봄이 초고음을 낼줄은 꿈에도 몰랐음...퉤니원 다시 뭉쳐서 활동하즈아~!!!!!
=
마지막 안무 in the club..... 눈물나네여...
=
Dia selalu sedih kalau ingat 2NE1.
=
박봄 목소리가 내스타일아니라서 별로안좋아하는데 이번 파이널무대만큼은 다른누구보다 좋았다고 생각함
=
im crying wtf
=
its cute seeing her struggling with her earpiece even though she slayed the high note
=
이거 어떤 효과에요? 저번에 들어봤었는데 기억이 안나서요ㅠㅠ 혹시 알려주실 수 있나요?
=
love BOM
=
노래 잘하네좋타 !!
=
봄-돌아가고싶어
CL- 돌아가자
=
헤어지면 더 소중함을 아는 것 같다. 진심이 닿는다면 다같이 모여 공연하는 날도 예능하는날도 올 거라고 ..
=
일하던 와중 목이 막히고 눈물이 납니다. 2ne1의 팬이었던 사람으로서 데뷔부터 해체까지 그 수많은 날이 나의 어린 시절을 같이 보낸 그 시간을 기억하게 해주는 추억인데, 많은 생각들을 들게 하네요. 그런 와중 박봄은 너무나도 노래를 잘했고 목소리도 여전히 좋다는 게 많이 속상합니다... 투애니원 모두가 남은 인생을 행복하게 보내면 좋겠습니다. 영원하자 투애니원
=
2ne1이라는 그룹은 그냥 단순한 아이돌이아니다. 누군가에겐 10대, 20대 그 자체일뿐.. 이 퍼포먼스 보면서 마이크 네개 나올때, 그리고 가사 자체가 너무 아파서 보면서 울었음.. 우리보다 본인들이 더 힘들겠지. 제발 우리곁으로 돌아와주길.
=
We will continue to love you no matter what.
=
queen i cried
=
THIS IS SO POWERFUL, OMG IM CRYING.
When I saw the MIC COLORS LINED UP I TEARED UP then when the girls walked in I WAS OVER WITH. 
Forever my bias, I dont even care if she doesnt win, she has made a statment and she has risen like the PHOENIX SHE IS. 

Hopefully we can see a 2NE1 reunion soon, I couldnt see it happening before but now I CAN SEE IT HAPPENING!


PARK BOM FIGHTING.
=
Her performances have been so meaningful for this show. Shes doing something completely different and it showcases her beauty and talent in the best way possible. Also the creative direction of the mirror scene and 2ne1 members had me like 😭😭😭 hair is on point and ending expression fierce as fuck. God i love her.
=
순위가 낮다고 상심 안 하셨으면 좋겠어요 박봄님 중학생인 저에게 최고의 가수시고 모든 솔로곡과 무대가 저를 울려요 박봄님만의 목소리와 무대를 꾸미는 방법은 아무도 따라올 수 없고 아무도 흉내낼 수 없는 박봄님만의 능력이예요 박봄님 뒤를 이어가시는 모든 아이돌 분들이 박봄님의 무대를 보고 감동받고 놀라는 것처럼 박봄님을 알아보는 많은 사람들이 박봄님의 무대에 감동 받고 놀랍니다 그룹 사이에서 혼자 무대를 꾸미시느라 수고하셨어요 앞으로 더 멋진 활동 기대할게요 제 눈엔 박봄님의 무대가 제일 예쁘고 멋있어요
=
제목부터 눈물나
=
Bom this way
=
The 4 mics, the dancers coming out to represent 21, the fabric on the floor reminiscent of 21s first mini album, the dance Bom did similar to one of their dances ugh I can’t this is so emotional for blackjacks 😭
=
Suatu kehormatan bagiku menjadi fans mu 💘💘😭😭 kau adalah yang terbaik
PARK BOM 💞💞 dan tak kan pernah tergantikan oleh siapapun 💖💖💖 karna kau unik dan satu2 nya park bom haha haha ha 😄😄😄SEMANGAT !💟💛💟💚 Jangan menyerah karna kami akan selalu bersama mu !!💝
#BOMSHELLFOREVER 💓💓
#2NE1BLACKJACKFOREVER
💙💜💖💙💜💖💙💜💖💙💜💖💙💜💖💙💜💖💙💜
=
대형가수
포스작렬  박봄~👍👍👍
=
Me encanta el es genial park bom 💕 es increíble pero cada vez que lo veo me hace llorar por qué recuerdo mucho el amor que le tengo a 2ne1 y no verlas juntas eso me hace ponerme triste y feliz a la ves bom 💕 siempre nos hace saber que las blackjack siempre estarán 👑👑👑👑
=
Wow very strong sound
=
마이크 색 보고 알았다ㅠ 2ne1 활동 당시 마이크 색이라는거ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 멤버들 옷 보고 울음😭
=
im crying thanx
=
시간을 돌려서 뒤로 가지를  못하니 지나온 추억은   가슴에. 담고 회상하며 다시 오지않는 나의 유년시절이 그립네요 이곡 들으니 ㅜ
=
Damn knowing the history of 2NE1 and scandals this makes it very emotional and touching.
=
COMO NAO CHORAR COM ESSA APRESENTAÇÃO???? MDS..
=
When tears fall out of nowhere as soon as the 3 dancers take the mics, we need to have them back. We just need 2NE1 again. 😔
=
경쟁보다 이런 감동이 난 좋았어요. 가사도 곡도 박봄씨 목소리도
=
2ne1 will comeback.
=
댄서들 의상이 내가 제일 잘나가 때 멤버들 의상 코스튬한거네.... 진짜그립다
=
지금 무한반복
=
Who else have noticed that the color of the mic is the same with her members' mic. Gold, Purple and Orange. Not same shade but same color. 


Don't touch me I'm crying.
=
이 노래 매번들을때마다 눈물 날것 같음 
2NE1팬은 아니지만 2NE1노래 들으면서 학창시절 보냈는데..
돌아갈수 없는~할때마다 나도 내 학창시절이 그립고 돌아갈수 없다는 점에서 공감됨
=
COME BACK HOME 2NE1 .....
=
보고싶다 2NE1
=
I thought 2NE1 was coming back at 01:36
=
2NE1’s disbandment is still by far the most tragic and emotional one...
=
i’ve been having on repeat this song since it came out, somehow i knew what she wanted to tell us through the lyrics and the performance confirmed my theory.
she’s talking to her old-self and to the girls, everything she’s been through, the bad and happy moments she embrace everything. 
that bittersweet feelings of wanting to go back in time will forever remain inside every human being, but at some point in your life, you have to move on and look forward, especially if you’ve been burned out really badly by life. and i think that’s what bom did in queendom, she started with you and i and ended this journey with wanna go back, she will always remember her career and her time with 2NE1 as happy memories but now it’s time for her to shine solo, to show everyone that she is not a bad person, she’s more than just a kpop idol.

also someone on twitter pointed out how the clock ticks 13 times back which would take her to 2006, when she first started singing as park bom from yg and at that point she rise dancing (randomly if you will) the in the club choreo. 
2NE1 debuted in 2009, as we’re leaving 2019 and entering 2020, i think everything will be different for bom, she has a new life now, a new agency, she made new friends through queendom and she has her music career back, which she worked so hard for.

i’m happy, this competition did good to her, she’s once again a new bom, ready to embrace a new path with so many new memories waiting for her in the future, keep on singing bom, we’re proud of you!
=
I`m just literally crying 😭😭😭
Miss 2ne1😭😭😭
=
I'm literally crying now
=
I need some Blackjack loving 😔
=
That mics 💔
=
2NE1 😭 De las mejores canciones de Bom en Queendom 😭
=
i had goosebumps when I saw there were three other colored mics on the stage ; ;
=
I keep coming back to watch this performance, it's so captivating.
=
I'm hating to those who made 2ne1 disbanded  everytime I watch how 2ne1 members suffered a lot
=
When the 3 mic come im cry ㅠㅠ
=
봄이언니 마지막춤추는거너무귀여워ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
It's kinda good that they just revealed first and second place for the final ranking, because we don't need to show who is last or whatever. Many of us came cheering for 1 group or a couple, but we soon realised they are all worthy queens and the show is just meant to show us that. I wouldn't have looked at Oh My Girl and Lovelyz because I thought they were the generic, happy, cheerleading, bubbly girl group. Through the show, Oh My Girl showed me so much more than that, and Lovelyz showed me that cutesy is not bad of a genre at all! Their Cameo performance was so splendidly sweet! We know all 6 are queen-worthy, and I'm delighted Mnet created this show. For once, they couldn't do any evil editing because some fandom's gonna beat their ass if they did hahaha.
=
Omg thisssss is sooo hurting
=
봄이 하고싶은거 다 해. 하고싶은거 전부 다 해ㅠㅠ
=
She is so cute OMG
=
왜 눈물이 나지..진짜 진심이 느껴진다..
=
I’d be so down if Jay Park signs Park Bom to AOMG. 3rd girl artist along with Hoody & Sogumm! 🙏🏽🙌🏽🌊🔥💕
=
謝謝春帶來這麼棒的表演，想你21妞們，陪伴我青春時期的女團 ❤
=
어떻게 계속 인이어 빠진 상태로 저렇게 노래를 부를수 있어ㅠ? 박봄 너무 천재다ㅠ
=
It's so painful to watch 😢😩
=
2ne1 제발한번뭉쳐줘ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ보고싶어!!!!!!!!
=
you are always being my queen :((  omg i miss 2NE1, miss my queen
=
Bomie poured her whole heart in this performance. She's so strong and this song is painfully beautiful, made me miss 2ne1 more and remembered all their struggles and hardships each of them went through. Park Bom, you're a real Queen. 💚
=
Here again watching this epic performance and wondering about:

1. Who composed the song? The lyrics is just too precious. And whenever the word Goodbye is mentioned, my mind just flashbacks to the last mv of 2ne1-Goodbye (2017). This is probably my 2nd saddest song after Goodbye.

2. Who planned the whole production? It’s an EPIC TRIBUTE to a LEGENDARY GROUP not just a performance. Every detail is a poignant memory for us who have been with them since the beginning.

> first part where she is looking into the mirror and reminiscing her past self, where she was at her peak performance or maybe we can call it MONSTER ROOKIES era  (when she dances and she was at her healthiest bodywise, but the choreo reminds me of i love you era but not exactly the same 🤣)

> second part when she joined the ICONIC MICROPHONE since their Nolza concert, their SIGNaTURE HAiR from MAMA 2015 and ROYAL ATTIRE from AON world tour opening which is black and gold.

>third part where everything was combined into one:
1. the silver cloth and maybe the silver attire which is the color and lettering of 2ne1 first album.
2. Ofcourse her green microphone since 2010
3. Her hair color and her pose while being raised is all from MAMA 2015
4. In the club choreo
5. The lights dancing in the air reminds me of the final part of Crush MV when they were shouting Nolza with fistpumps in the air and they were also elevated from others.
6. Her final pose. I’ve been searching but have never seen HER do this pose. BUT in every final pose of 2ne1 in their performances, it’s either they all line up with 2NE1/LOVE(from DYLM era) hand sign OR one of them is doing this pose while the other 3 are standing in the back. I have seen CL with this pose for Fire, Dara in Gotta be You and Minzy for MAMA 2015. This is the only time I see Bom with this pose probably because she is known to wear short skirts.

Nolza FOURever ♠️♦️♣️♥️
=
다른 무대들도 정말 멋있었고, 감탄이 절로 나왔지만 박봄의 이번 무대는 눈물이 나오게 하는 무대였다. 언니 수고했어요.
=
박봄.. 최고!!
=
This is so emotional. A finale only a queen can give.
=
Did you see the 3 mics? I cried!
=
노래들으면서 우는거 첨이당 ........눈물나오네괜히
=
For fans who don’t know, the dance that park bom dance at last is from 2ne1 first mini album - in the club
=
봄이 팬이 아니신분들   참고로  인더클럽 검색하셔서 들어보길바랍니다  4여제 라이브 정말 멋있습니다  ^^
=
엠넷 투표는 더 이상 못 믿겠음 다른 투표 영상들도 믿을만한 증거 좀 보여줬으면 저게 조작이 아닐지 누가 암.
=
i looooove all the performances but bom's performance is the most emotional and heartbreaking.
=
내 마음 속 1위는 언니!
=
하..눈물나와..ㅜ씁 ㅠ
=
a queen. periodt.
=
존나눈물난다..
=
스탠드 마이크 네개에 하나 봄이자리 비어있는거 .. ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 아 이번무대 진짜 너무 집중되고 멋있음.....
=
BLACKJACKS WE NEED 2NE1 STAGE IN MAMA 2019!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
Am I the only one who noticed that thos 3 back up dancers is like representing the othrr members of 2ne1 and the lyrics of the song is like Park Bom's song for 2ne1? My blackjack heart omg
=
Omg😢She put 4 mics on the stage...just like 2ne1 was there.
=
박봄언니 살찐건가..?
=
She really misses 2ne1, you can feel the sensation of missing someone in the whole song, she created a presentation worthy of the MamA she will do something amazing there 😿😿😿😿😿
=
퀸덤 차별인가 박봄 영상 거의 다른 아이돌 영상보다 밑에 내려가 있는 이유 좀. 조회수는 젤 많던데 이거
=
아 진짜 미쳤어 목소리
=
That’s what you call a singer when you’re watching it through the screen but can feel all them emotions...
=
1:20 “늘 함께였던 너”할 때 3번 하는거 진짜 마음아프다
=
민지 영상편지, 그걸 보고 서럽게 우는 봄이, 멤버들에게 말하는 노래 가사, 무대에서 등장한 각 멤버들 색깔의 마이크, 음색에 몇 번이고 펑펑 울었다 수고많았고 처음으로 좋아하고 응원한 2ne1 10년 전에도 지금도 여전히 응원해요 사랑해
=
She only conquer the stage using her voice and emotion 😢
=
Yes. She is my Queen.
=
혼자 퀸덤 출연해서 많이 외롭고 힘들었겠지만 잘 버텨주고 마지막까지 멋있던 너의 모습... 영원히 내 마음 속에 남겨둘게. 박봄 앞으로 꽃길만 걸어라!❤
=
그냥 최고,, 무슨말이 더 필요해
=
무대 최고다 이번만큼은 박봄이 일등이었으면 좋겠다ㅠㅠ
=
그거아세요^봄양이 항상  헤어스타일이 머리내리고 다니는거 이마가 짱구이마라  본인 나름대로 컴플랙스같은그건데 근데 그게전 참이쁘고 매력적인데  언젠가 앞머리 흩날릴때 자세히 보세요 귀요미예요 ㅎ
=
😭😭😭😭😍
=
I burst into tears when this performance came on for Queendom. You should have scored way higher Bommie! <3
=
I wish she
Was a winner
=
♥️♥️♥️
=
Our baby🥺💚
=
FOREVER QUEEN!
=
Love her. 🧡🧡🧡
=
Man, there is so much meaning behind this and it makes it so much more heartfelt because there is a real story, real raw emotions behind it all.
=
Love u Park BOM
=
I see 2ne1 in this performance
.. 4 mics ... 4 colors... 4 costumes
=
가사가 투애니원때 얘기하는 거 같다..
=
Meudeus me arrepiei, Bom sempre surpreende. 😢♥️
=
아 진짜 언니 하고 싶은 거 다 해요ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 
박봄 아니고서야 할 수 없는 무대임 . 와 소름 쫙 돋네 진짜 와..
=
Joder!!!! Después de tantos años se puso mas hermosa!!!!!
=
박봄씨 노래 정말 좋은데요?멋진 컴백무대!  응원의 박수를 보냅니다 짝짝짝!
=
You are my queen
=
Next time 2ne1 time to comeback.😢😢.pls give us chance.😊😊
=
믿듣봄
=
I love the imagery.
=
Salut sama park boom udah berusaha dari nol lg.. Dan luar biasa usahanya. Sukses terus park boom 😘😘😘
=
박봄 좋아하지도 않고 성형중독과 세월으로 몸도 많이 망가졌지만.  이무대만큼은 과거 투에니원 때 이상의 무대를 보여준다 멋지다.
=
진짜 감성.. 눈물나오러같은 감성.. 이노래 짱인데 ㅠㅠㅠ 대중들이 관심가졋으면 일위햇을거 같음 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
preguiçosa kkkkkkk
=
4 mics😭😭😭😭
=
I badly want to see 2NE1 together again huhuhu
=
웨케 눈물이나는지..
=
When you confuse for 1st minute which one is bom 😂
=
Notice the mc introduced Bom as legendary? That's right,  she is here to boost viewership and ratings, so no ranking needed for her as she is only here to showcase the best performance!
=
박봄무대가 너무 슬프다 평생 그룹같았던 사람들과 떨어지고 혼자 무대를 하지만 그동안에 자신을 괴롭히고 아프게 했던일을 다 풀어낸것같은 느낌이다 역시 박봄이라는 말을 해주고싶다 ㅠㅠ 공민지가 박봄에게 영상편지 남겼을때 솔직히 투애니원 활동때가 더 그리웠던 추억으로 남았기에 이 노래가 만들어진것같다 박봄 최고다 그대가 가는길은 앞으로 아픈 가시같은 장미꽃이 아니라 편안하고 따뜻한 벚꽃이길...
=
This song is stuck in my head right now. I been here when this episode came out. But now I’m ad addicted to this song
=
마지막에 위에서 춤추는게 왜 그런진 모르겠는데 너무 슬프다...ㅠㅠ
=
진짜 솔로로 계속 활동해주세요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 봄언니 
퀸덤하느라 수고많으셨어요 다른 그룹들과 대결한다는게 불리한 조건이 많았지만 
파이널 진짜 잘하셨고 다른무대도 저에게 또 다른 봄언니팬들에겐 언니가 1등이였어요 행복해주세요 봄언니
=
Now I know eventhough there’re many stars but she is the brightest one!
=
Proud fan u gave ur heart and more in this song
=
목소리  좋다
=
I watched the entire show just this past weekend and I am so disappointed that she wasn't place higher. The people of Korea who did noy vote for her are seriously deaf and blind and or just still mad to be mad at her for her "scandal"... This girl did extremely great all by herself... She sang her heart out... showed so much emotions and she gets 5th and 6th?! This show is straight bs from the start! This performance was everything! Bom won in my eyes. I wouldn't had watched the shoe if it wasn't for her! Thank you Bom for returning to the stage. I know it's hard, but hang in there! Justice will be serve to all 2ne1 members and blackjacks. My heart still hurts. To had waited for a comeback especially after MAMA performance and got disbanded news instead. Love you Bommie!! YOU ARE A LEGEND!!
=
박봄님의 퀸덤 마지막 곡은 퀸덤 수락했을때부터 박봄님이 이 곡을 기획하고 만들어놨던 거 같습니다
앞의 곡들은 이 곡을 부르기위한 준비과정
퀸덤 공연 순위 상관없이 
결승전 1위는 개인적으로 
박봄님이라 생각합니다
진짜  마이크4개보고 2ne1나와서 같이 해주나 기대했네요 ㅜ
=
only queens 2ne1 can drop their mic hahahhaha
=
صيره يمينه  كلش اسفه
=
사랑해 박봄
=
춤선이 박봄같다 저댄서
=
CRUSH OUTFITS! 
The In the club choreo in the end!! 

QUEEN EVEN IF YOU DIDN’T WIN! YOU’RE STILL OUR QUEEN!
=
Bom, nós também sentimos falta do 2NE1...
=
That signatures red hair of Bom is back.
Those four mics and its individual colors.
The four dancers with the same outfit and hair as CL, Dara and Minzy 😭😭😭
=
💘
=
I CANT HOLD MY TEARS BACK. THIS MADE ME CRY. I MISS 2NE1 SO MUCH. 😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
UUUUUUUGGGHHHH MY HEART! I didn’t tear up the whole time I swear😰
=
Love BOM, love her Talent & her Strong heart. from a (G)I-DLE's fan.
=
"I'll be here till the day you come back. I'll be waiting for you"
=
this song is a masterpiece and it reminds me of the good time when 2NE1 are active with 4 girls:((
=
Have y'all noticed that she dropped the mic at the end before she posed? ICONIC
=
Im just crying 😭 I just can’t believe 2NE1 disbanded, it breaks my heart so much just to think about it and this song is just everything to me 
Hopefully they could perform one day again on stage ✨❤️✨
=
when i realized the the mics and the girls were supposed to signify the group back together i bawled
=
I can't stop my tears 💔😭
=
Oh my god ! Im crying right now 😭😭
I miss 2ne1 🖤
=
Crying while watching this. 😭❤️
=
🎶I can't turn back time
I can't go back ......
I wanna turn back time

The lyrics of this song says it all. We miss u too soooo much #2ne1 #BlackjacksFourever #ComeBackHome #QUEENS #LEGENDS
=
I miss that red hair and the legendary mic omggggg 😍
=
The color of microphone makes me cry😭😭

=
4 coloured mics, lyrics. Definitely delicated to 2NE1, much misses😢❤
=
I wanted to watch this without the lyrics and I started to get tears in my eyes. So emotional eventhough I dont understand the language. I love this girl so much and she deserves the love and respect of the size of the universe!
=
The reason why I still stay as a fan of any k-artist in this industry because I was really hoping that one day, 2ne1 will able to rise again. They will revive again the feels of the Golden Era. My childhood memories of that Era. I still wanted to trust that they will shake the kpop world.

 I will always love you bom 💖 You will be always be a Queen 👑

Loop again and again
Omg

She is amazing. Even she is on the last place. She won over millions of hearts
=
고마워요 좋은노래 불러줘서
=
She may not win, but she wins my heart ❤️ blackjack forever
=
omg i can't. I'm literally crying non-stop because of this it's so sad. 3 mikes with the 3 girls dancing in the same outfits as the members in their last performance, the beginning of the song where she sits in front of the mirror while the dancer who looks like her showing how even though she's hurting so much she still performs and oh my god the lyrics.
I'm ugly crying right now
=
what's up，we‘re 2ne1!!!

=
마지막 엔딩샷 꼭 뭔가 계속보고 있는데 디즈니 인어공주 같은데 개인적으로 그냥 거품속으로 사라졌단 얘기가 2ne1때를 회상하는 느낌으로 들리네욤
=
Og my god... my blackjack heart... minji, Cl , dara signature mic there
=
Queen BOM!
=
가사웰케슬프냐ㅠ
=
2NE1은 다른 해체한 아이돌에 비해 멤버들이 다 그룹을 너무 그리워하는게 느껴진다.. 멤버불화나 배우로 전향하고싶은 멤버가 없었으니.. YG가 조금만 더 신경써줬다면 계속 그룹활동 했었을 수 있을 것 같았는데 정말 아쉬운 그룹... 
당장은 힘들겠지만 언젠간 다시 완전체로 돌아와주길 그때까지 기다리고 있을게요🙏
=
Omy 😲😲 She really misses 2ne1 by telling on her song😫😫😫
=
마지막에 추는 춤 인더클럽...
=
돌아갈 곳 없는에서 너무 슬프다
=
화장 연하게 한 봄씨 보고싶어요
=
that green mike though
=
응원합니다!
=
솔로라 퍼모먼스 면에서 딸려서 그렇지.  이번 곡 너무 좋은거 같다.
=
Bom whyyyyy😭
=
Even I don't  understand what she sings but why I'm crying
=
민지 영상 보고 나도 모르게 흐느끼면서 오열한 1인..
그리워해요.. 그리워해요.. 그리워해요..
그리워해요.. 그리워해요.. oh..
너.너.너 가 너무 그리워.. 할 때
CL, MINZY, DARA가 너무 그리워..
같애서 진짜 오열했어요..
옷도 nolza 때 옷 같고, 머리도 박수쳐 때 생각 나고.. 마이크 컬러도..
=
내 기준 가장 기억에 남았음.. 어제 보면서 진짜 눈물 날뻔했음 특히 민지 응원영상 나올때...

나도 한번 정리해보는 떡밥들
-빨간머리=투애니원인 박봄으로써 마지막으로 한 2015mama무대때의 머리 (되돌돌 무대 몇일전에 급하게 바꾼것으로 보임)

-4개 마이크
색깔별로 다라 씨엘 민지를 나타냄

-백댄서 의상
이것도 2015mama 멤버들 의상

-마지막에 올라가는 저 반짝거리는 비닐
아돈케어 앨범 표지

-열심히 박봄이 추는 춤..^♡^
인더클럽 도입부 안무

+++ 2019 11 08 현시점
CL이 와이지랑 재계약 안하고 나왔음
=
사랑해
=
박봄 진짜 최고다 그동안 퀸덤하면서 혼자 솔로라 힘든 면도 많았을텐데 계속 좋은 무대 보여줘서 고마워요 우리 오래 오래 함께해요💚
=
look at those mics and the dancers costume guys im cryin rn :(
=
나한테는 박봄이 1위야. 고생했어! 우리도 투애니원했을때가 그립다.. 보고싶어 넷이서 무대하는 모습.. 언젠가는 다시 뭉칠수있다는 생각을 하는데 꼭 다시 뭉치자!
=
The 4 colored mics broke me...
=
At the end it feels like she's ready to finally throw her green mic and move forward.
=
존나 눈물바다.....
=
I think Bom is in a place where she has been through so much, she is just happy singing on stage. She may be much older than the other teams, she's not able to put on such flashy performances and dances anymore like the others and she just has this distinct image that doesn't really allow her to put on a mask on stage (like acting sth out etc) but all of that makes her stages so much more emotional, real and authentic since she pretty much only sings. I actually never believed that she would win against all those groups since she has a huge disadvantage as a solo artist. But I'm still happy that she was given this opportunity to show her talent and rebuild her brand and connect with the other teams ♥♥
=
무대 바닥에 깔려있다가 무대 후반부에 들어올려지는 저 천은 In the club 수록된 앨범의 앨범커버랑 같은 색이고, 박봄이 무대 마지막에 추는춤은 In the club 안무임 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
와 노래 진짜 존나좋다... 소름돋는다 ......
=
If Bom wants to go back, she's going back to be with the girls 
I don't think I'll watch this again without crying tbh
=
Imma throw hands if 2ne1 doesn't reunite on mama 2019
=
박봄언니 목소리 국보지정해조라 ,,,,,,,,,,, 진짜 이 목소리를 이 시대까지 라이브로 들을 수 있다는게 진짜 눈물나게 좋다. 투애니원 너무 그리워 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 박봄언니 아직도 진짜 이쁘고 대단하신거 아시죠 ? 그니까 계속 활동해줘요 ,,, 요즘 너무 행복해 다시 언니 목소리 들어서 !!!!!!!!!!! ❤️
=
와 무대 멋있다생각하고 댓글읽다가 무대 다시보니까 울컥..ㅠㅜ 박봄은 멤버들의 빈자리를 노래로 채워가고있었구나
=
와 진짜 혼자서 너무 무대 멋있게 소화하고 정말 대단하다
=
Starting from 3:40, the choreography that she did is from 2ne1 song "in the club" right??😢
=
저 마이크 색은 투애니원 멤버들이 썼던 마이크 색인가...??
=
That 4 mics!!! And thise 3 other girls dancing with her.
=
박봄 되게 인어공주 같다 ㄷㄷ
정말 리즈인듯함🍀
=
Bom is nominated in 3 categories for MAMA, please sign up voting every day, Bom needs us!! 💚👑
=
존나 되돌려주고싶음 이노래들으면 후..혐슥이
=
Bom did the same thing for the show as she did for 2ne1. She was a "beautifully unique transition." Which made this show special and made 2ne1 unique
=
My 2NE1 heart is crying so hard
=
The chorus singing “I want to go back” breaks my heart... YG really did 2NE1 dirty at the end...
=
She snatched wigs, stole hearts, and poured her emotions in our eyes. This was HER moment, BOM's moment.
=
내가 이거 몇번째 보는건지 모르겠다 .. 박봄만한 가수 얼마없다.. 시계 똑딱소리 13번 소름 돋았잖아 ... 박봄언니 항상 응원해요 ㅠ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
When I saw all the mics all feels just came back and I felt like I was about to cry 😭.. I know 2ne1 will not reunite here but all the feels ang memories that Bom was able give in show for 2ne1 girls and blackjacks is just priceless.
=
Not even a fan of 2ne1 but her love for the members made me stan 2ne1 and find out how a beautiful person Park Bom is.
As a fan of Mamamoo I'm happy that they won, but low-key I wanted Park Bom to win, the whole performance is full of emotions, professional and tells a beautiful story. 
I hope that she will have the recognition she deserves and even more
=
I started crying when I realized that the dancers were representing  Dara, CL and Minzy
=
This is so beautiful I’m speechless. It’s like a love letter to her members and to the fans
=
Omygaad. My heart 😭
=
YES THIS MADE ME BALL MY EYES OUTTTTTT.
=
We love you so much Park Bom! Thank you for standing strong despite of everything!
=
Her song to 2NE1 members 😭
=
Man this song is so powerful and heart breaking! I didn't have the subtitles on at 1st, but as soon as I saw the 4 mics w/ 3 dancers, I immediately understood. I had to start the whole video over to watch w/ the subtitles. This was amazing, I hope all of her 2NE1 members could see this too! 😢
=
And congratulations to all Mnet & Queendom people for this masterpiece of TV perfection <3
=
I want to see the other team's reaction.
=
she is amazing i miss her
=
I cried from the video message of Minzy till the end of the performance. I love 2ne1, always a Blackjack <3
=
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ PARK BOM U ARE PERFECT
=
As a fan of 2ne1 , I’m crying after I watched this performance 😥🥺❤️
=
I'm crying so much!! I miss 2ne1 😭😭😭
=
im crying in front of my parents, they asking me why you crying in the morning while watching youtube ..
and when i show this to them, my mom say, the lyrics is too sad, it has meaning story cause the singer is almost crying ..
and i say, mom she was a part of girlgroup called 2ne1, one of the best girl group in south korea ..
after hearing that my mom say, did they have song that sound like that: bom ratatata tatata tata hey (while doin the dance choreo)
im laughing out loud and got goosebumps, i dunno that my mom know 2ne1, but she say her bias is Sandara, but no worries Park bom, she like you cause u're beautiful and has an amazing voice also🥰🥰😍😍
=
i got goosebumps watching this omigod
=
I think this was Park Bom's best stage on Queendom. Great way to end the show.
=
forever blackjack 😭❤❤
=
I cried 😭
=
I'm crying 😭😭this is too beautiful😍😭😍😍
=
My tears cant heandle, even though your song at the beginning of the release number 6 for me you are still number 1 💕, your song a magic to take my heart and blackjack.Thanks for joining in Queendom #Imissyou2ne1
=
I cried so hard.  Way to go Bom!!!
=
She's like a Queen
=
Its really break my heart miss you 2ne1
=
Park Bom, you made me cry. I miss 2ne1 😭💕
=
I saw the mics and I was like... I MISS 2NE1 T.T
=
When they showed 2NE1's signature colored mics 😢
=
She is the queen 👑😍
=
QUEEN 😭✊💘💘💘
=
Those microphones.. 😭😭😭
=
Park Bom is a legend 😭😭😭 her song is very dedicated 😭
=
Fantastic reallyyy!!!
=
We all wanna go back... 💔💔

I really need 2ne1 back. My tears won't stop. 💔💔
=
I started to cry alot ! 2ne1 was my first kpop girl group and bigbang  I listened too this two groups  and they will forever be my first favorite kpop artists whom got me into kpop and watching this whole performance and song it was very emotional to me and I bet many others whom listen to 2ne1 I respect every single one of them and I hope I see them once again even if its just one day for them to perform together that would be amazing ! But for now all i want for them is their good health and good future opportunities so I can be able see them often !
=
I’m crying😭😭😭
=
Bow down to THE QUEEN 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
=
Proud of you 👏👏👏👏
=
박봄 너무 특색있는 예쁜 가수다♥
=
The lyrics are so beautiful❤
=
Park Bom! 💖😍🤗
=
Oh my.. I love you so much Park Bom
=
En mi corazón eres la ganadora ❤️
Mi corazón siempre estará contigo y 2ne1
=
퀸덤은진짜 팬덤싸움이였던듯....우리마음속에 1등은 박봄ㅠㅠㅠ엉엉
=
When I was Cl & Minzy & Dara's mics, there was an waterfall in my eyes. I was really hoped other members will come... But, this was so emotional!
=
*I'm not crying you are😢*
=
We want 2ne1 back. The members want 2ne1 back. 
Why hasn't it happened yet?
=
Bom unnie!! we're here blackjacks hear you <3
=
너 너 너. [you] for three times....this is  a touch stage
=
She dont deserve the last place...she did so much....from all the other performances, it was the only one that i felt...honest...bom....for me you're the winner of this
=
I didn’t even stan 2ne1 but this made me cry so much
=
love bom !!!!! we love you !!!!! blackjack forever and ever
=
투애니원 너무 그립다...
=
I miss 2ne1 😢
=
We are with you Bommie <3<3 ps:that mic drop in the end tho
=
Thank you for being a living proof that 2nd gen Kpop IS THE BEST ERA EVER!! Thank you Bom unnie for reminding me why I fell inlove with Kpop. It was definitely because of you 4 queens–2NE1 will forever be the queens and I don't care about the bashing I'll get by saying this but I stand by my claims. NO ONE WILL EVER COMPARE. And Park Bom will always be my #1 bias... I could still recall her cute bunny costume during Fire promo days.
=
YG needs to bring 2NE1 back if they want to rise up again
=
I LOVE THIS and it made me cry like hell. I only wish they made a way to not make her cover her face for the first half of the song. 😞
=
😭😭😭❤
=
가창력과 노래실력으로 이렇게 아름다운 음악을 만들어 주셔서 감사합니다. 용기를 주는 그런 음악이에요. ♥
=
MAEZINHA LINDA EU TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
=
봄이언니 행복하자!
=
I don’t know u guys but to me her song is the catchiest and when she sings, her voice really delivers the emotion and i never hear her hit the note that she hits in this song 😅🥰 i love it! Actually, all of her songs that she put out so far is good! The fans nowadays just voted not by the quality but by whose group that is currently famous at the time. I feel sorry for Park Bom but i gotta feeling that this is only the beginning of her new journey..this is good for her image and to let the younger generation know of her existence kinda almost..so, good luck Park Bom! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 all the best! ❤️❤️❤️😘😘
=
I'm so happy and proud of her!! She is so brave and strong for coming back to music and breaking through. Keep shining Bommie!
=
✨💖✨
=
I'm still crying. It's the middle of the day and I'm crying like there's no stopping it. Bom is the Queen. No questions asked. The immeasurable amount of courage you would need to go do this. All by herself on stage exposing just how much she's hurting and missing her members, her best friends, her family, WHILE she's paving way for all the other girls in the industry, showing that you can go solo, you can have the body you do, you can be fiercer than ever in your thirties. That there's no stopping her. She's my role model. There I said it.
=
노래 존나 조타 진짜ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜ 여왕이 아니라 황제다 황제.....
=
아 진짜 눈물난다. 내 학생시절을 최고의 히트곡들로 채워줬던 2NE1이 이제 없다는 사실이 다시금 다가왔고 박봄이 그 누구보다 그들을 그 시절을 그리워하는게 보여서 더 눈물난다. 봄언니 힘내라!!
=
THE AMOUNT OF POWER THIS WOMAN HOLDS OH MY GOD.
=
박봄 사랑해❤❤❤❤❤
너무 완벽한 무대 되돌릴 수 없고 돌아갈 수 없고 돌아갈 곳 없지만 그때의 느낌을 되돌려주고 그때의 느낌으로 돌아가주고 지금의 위치에서 잘 해줘❤❤❤❤
=
Ngaun lang ulit ako nanuod ng mnet dahil dto kay bommy na performance
=
노래 엄청 잘 하는 구나 ,,, 눈으로 계속 얘기해서 눈물난다
=
🌸2NE1 forever🌸
=
지금 나의 심정....봄이씨노래 항상좋네요. 10년전이나 지금이나.. 용감한형제 작곡가님은 천재네요....
=
노래 개좋고 음원1등간다 근데 무대도 너무잘햇는데 옷 누가 저런거 입힌거야? ㅡㅡ
그리고 인이어 ㅠㅠ 자꾸 빠지는게 낄라고 하는 뽀미 근데 누나 춤 못추는건 여전하네.. 마지막 퍼포먼스.춤 ㅠㅠ 기여웟어
=
💙
=
아 진짜 춤 진짜 못추는데 너무 열심히 추는거 겁나 귀엽다고요ㅠ
=
박봄!! 정말 처음 유앤아이부터 한, 허수아비, 눈코입, 그리고 이 곡까지.. 투애니원 생각나서 너무 뭉클하고 노래 자체도 넘 좋았음. 그간 좋은 노래 들려줘서 넘 좋았고 앞으로도 쭉쭉 활동하길!! 그리고 오늘 무대 연출 넘 좋았고 감동이었음!!
=
i miss 2ne1 so much, just know you're not alone bom, we're here for you
=
i feel so sad about Sulli, my sincere consolation to her fan. But as the one who following 2NE1, i feel so thankful that Bommie has been through the struggle and it’s wonderful now seeing her on the stage. Park Bom unnie, if you feel pressured, discouraged, hatred from K-netizen, pls remember that you are having fully support from international fan. Pls keep going with what you’re doing and we are still looking forward to 2NE1 reunion.
=
I feel like she was perform at mama 2019.. it's not a competition show

인더클럽 앨범 바닥에 마지막 춤도 인더클럽 춤...투애니원 다시 합쳤으면 ㅠ
=
WHO ELSE SHED TEARS 😭
=
I swear, 2ne1 disbanding was the worst thing that happened to kpop, I literally stopped being a kpop stan when I heard the news about 2ne1's sudden and informal disbandment - there was just no closure at all for each of the members, and us Blackjacks always hope that they reunite one day, because they were all doing so great until it happened. I don't blame Minzy for not renewing her contract, and I'm certainly not blaming any 2ne1 members I just honestly thought YG could've handled the situation properly instead of debuting a new group (yes, Blackpink, I'm sorry for bringing them here) to cover YG's inability to properly take care of his artists. 


I miss 2ne1, and 2ne1 misses itself too - and it clearly shows. Park Bom's performance here has been the culmination of all that. We witness what she feels like from her perspective through her music. Whenever we listen to sad songs, we always CANNOT AVOID correlating it with her missing her group.


I've always been a silent person when it comes to the comment section, but seeing as this is the final performance and she dedicated this to her members as well as acknowledged the fact that she is now a SOLOIST, I'm just so happy that she took the leap of faith and the courage to start from scratch. It's not an easy thing to do, from being recognized as one of the best in the industry to going bacm from scratch where she has to make people pay attention to HER ALONE. I'm just so happy that she went back to music, and I'm so happy I came back to music because of her. She's my inspiration since 2008.
=
The dancer looks like dara, CL, and minzy when "crush" comeback 😭😭😭
=
okay I'm crying
=
민지 응원영상 나올 때 나도 울뻔했음 진짜..박봄 표정도 그렇고 그냥 너무 슬펐다고ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
We proub of you😍Park Bom😍
We 4ever blackjacks😍😍😍#2NE1💓💓💓
=
I was imagining the other three members would come and sing with her
=
저 말을 얼마나 하고싶었을까 가슴속에 꽁꽁 담아뒀던 말을 이제서야 쏟아낸거같아서 더 뭉클ㅠㅠ 그대는 항상 따뜻한 봄이였으면..
=
she's not just singing... She's telling a story..
=
SHES JUST WANT WORLD SEE HER HOW HER BACK THEN , AND OPEN YOUR EYES WIDED
=
박봄 예고편에 금발였던거 너무 예뻤는데 무튼 투애니원을 그리워하며 만든 무대,노래라 많이 격앙되었었구나 박봄 노래는 다 좋음 본인의 소화능력이 좋아서 인것도 확실히 있는듯 잔잔한 노래도 박봄화시키고
=
I miss the 2nd generation of k-pop so so much.
=
Feel her love, feel her pain, feel her soul voice <3
=
Queen 💕❤️❤️❤️
=
She miss 2ne1 
I’m miss 2ne1 và we miss 2ne1 Love unnie

Bom, you are a legend. And I know you missed those memories...... Us too, we want the whole 2ne1 member.




CONGRATULATIONS IN ADVANCE, BOM, YOU WILL REMAIN LEGEND IN OUR HEARTS. WETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE, WE STILL WUV YOU!

=
This performance makes me very sad 😭, it is clear that she did this for 2NE1, the lyrics of the song are dedicated to them and Bom misses, the moment, to be able to return again with them, Hopefully in the future we can see them again  all together ❤️
=
투애니원 생각나서 진짜 보면서 눈물났어...ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 계속 응원할게요 박봄언니ㅠㅠㅠ

마지막에 앉고 딱 보는게 여자아이들도 여왕 컨셉이지만 박봄이 진짜 여왕아닐까 보자마자 이 생각밖에 안든다 제일 잘어울리고 박봄만이 보여줄있는 그런 여왕
=
I have never been a fan of 2ne1 or Park Bom but I have to admit she got me this time
She really is amazing, her message and song was also very beautiful and emotional.👌💜
=
무대 멋졋어요~ 그동안  좋은 무대 즐감햇네요~ 수고햇어요~^^
=
나머지도  
박봄처럼 그리워하며 생각할까..?
=
If Park Bom doesn't deserve a win, I don't know who does
=
진짜 귀에꼽는거(인이어?) 계속 빠지는데도 실수하나 안하네ㅠㅠ 너무 프로같아 언니 투애니원으로 컴백해주세요ㅠㅠㅠㅜ
=
진짜 민지 언니에서 입틀어막고 울었고 마이크 3개 가운데에 언니 서있는데 진짜 뭘 어케해야될지를 모르겠더라 걍 엄청 울었음
=
2NE1 Please Come Back😔
=
순위는 중요하지 않다
모든 무대가 진짜 소중하고 좋았어요 앞으로 계속 보고싶을뿐 ㅠ ㅠ
=
1분 52초쯤 보면 인이어 빠져있음.. 보통 당황하고 실수할텐데 진짜 대단하다... 언니 진짜 멋지고 노래도 잘부르시고 최고예요
=
Bommieee 😭
=
육등이였지만 저한테는  일등이였던무대!!! 무대 너무 좋았어요 예술작품을 본 느낌이에요!

봄언니 계속 노래해줘...ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 너무눈물남 이무대
=
I still can't believe this won the last  place on Queendom... This whole performance is artistic and full of references. Respect to all 3rd gen groups but we all know the fact-nowdays it's all about looks,being skinny and dancing. 
Our Bommie deserved much better, but in the end she showed us that 2NE1 is still relevant. That's the chemistry some of your faves will never have. Be blessed
=
언니 때문에 내 입이 다물어지지 않잖아요나 햄버거 한 입에 먹을 때도 이렇게 입 크게 안벌리는데 언니 덕분에 내 인생 최고기록 갱신했어
=
박봄 레전드 영상이다. 최종화는 정말 박봄다웠던 박봄의 모든 것 이었다 . 언니 사랑해요
=
안녕이랑 가사이어지는듯 ㅠㅠ
=
She really performed the high note live I am SHOOKTH
=
I “WANNA GO BACK” where 2NE1 still exist in the Kpop & International Music Industry
=
투애니원 재결합해줘ㅜㅜㅜㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠ진짜 한번만이라도 다 같이 무대 서서 무대해주세요ㅠㅠㅠ투애니원 정말 많이 보고싶어..
=
Aaaaaaaaa the goddess
=
when the dancers came out in the 'Crush' outfits in front of CL, Dara and Minzy's mics i lost it
=
Alguien noto los demás micrófonos con los colores de 2ne1 😦😢 awww vuelvan plis
=
진짜 퀸덤무대들 다 보고왔는데 박봄무대만큼 여운남는게 없더라 이 영상만 맨날 돌려볼듯..
=
엠넷은 문자투표 못 믿겠음ㅋㅋ...
=
몇번째 보고 있는데 눈물이 쥴쥴쥴ㅜ 사실 정식팬활동은 안했지만 퉤니 너무너무 좋아했어서 퀸덤보면서 매회 맘이 아팠어요ㅜ
=
EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. SHE ATE THE CDS. SHE LOOKS STUNNING. THE PRODUCTION IS TOP NOTCH. I LOVE IT
=
I love Park Bom
=
진짜 미쳤다....혼자서 무대 다 씹어먹음 진짜 퀸이다 퀸. 박봄 아니면 누가 퀸 해?
=
박봄은 투애니원 때부터 춤을 뚝딱뚝딱 췄는데 ㅋㅋㅋ 하나도 이상하다는 느낌과 춤못춰서 거슬리는 느낌 1도 못 느낌 너무 귀여워ㅠㅠ 그만큼 노래를 잘하니까 춤은 노래로 커버하면 됐었는데... ㅠㅠㅠ 지금도 넘 커엽잖아 저 몸 짓이 너무 귀여워 ㅠㅠㅠ 뚝딱거리는게 ㅠㅠ 박봄스러워서 좋아...
=
this performance is a visual and vocal delight with a very heavy feeling in the heart.
=
I cry so much because of this
=
yall surprise with her hitting that note ? She been nailing that in 2ne1 songs + epik high collab "Up", and her latest performance in immortal song also featured her hitting that note. Just queen being queen

=
During this part of the wanna go back performance the clock strikes 13 times. If we go back 13 years ago that is the year Park Bom began her musical career (in 2006). This performance is filled with so many little references 😱💕💕💕💕
=
Miss you 2NE1 😭
=
Ahh the message of the song is for the comeback of 2NE1 😢😢😢..
=
*524 people can choke in every bom's high note*
=
You are loved PARK BOM . Please know that ❤

She didnt deserve that last place with this legendary performance! She's a winner in my heart.
=
"늘 함께였던 너"에서 너를 3번 부르는게 2ne1맴버 3명 모두를 한명한명 지목해서 부르는거 같아서 더 슬프네요..
=
I'm criying 😭
=
We all wanna go back. :(
=
무대 연출 진짜 시작부터 개 미쳤다...ㄷㄷ
=
늘 함께 였던 너너너 이부분
민지 씨엘 다라 가르키는거 같아서 너무 짠함.
=
하.... 역시 본인노래부를때 제일 좋아.....
그와중에 맨 처음에 박봄 건너편에 앉은 사람 넘 부러운것.......
=
01:52 이때쯤에 인이어 빠졌는데도 끝까지 실수안하심.... 언니 개멋져요 진짜
=
박봄언니 제맘속에 1등이에여 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
BOM 😭😭😭
=
박봄은 내 1위야ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 무대 하나하나 다 옛날 생각나서 나도 눈물나ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Bom really misses 2ne1 from the red hair cant nobody era to her microphone that serves her symbol of being a 2ne1 member and the 3 back up dancers that symbolizes CL Minzy and Dara on Crush .. I MISS YOU 2NE1!!!!!!♠️
=
Love her.
=
다시 봐도 대단하고 눈물나온다 어떻게 혼자서 이런 무대구성이 가능할까ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠ
진짜 볼 때마다 눈물나옴ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I don’t want to cry but I just did.
=
I miss 2NE1 😭😭😭😭😭
=
2ne1 please comeback 💜💜💜💜💜💜
=
노래듣고 우는거 처음인것같다 진짜 마이크 네개도 너무 마음 울리고 목소리도 그렇고 가사도 너무 그렇다 진짜 앞으로 더 행복했음 좋겠음 박봄

=
2NE1!!💜😭😭😭😭
=
Well, that would win the show for me if I was in charge. All the groups did great, but Bom certainly is the standout, with a special voice and an iconic past. The performance was rife with messaging about what she has gone through, her past, present and future. Her singing is just absolutely wonderful and the meaning behind it all only elevates it to the next level. When she throws the mic at the end, it's a powerful statement, but bitter sweet moment. As the song says, she wishes and would give anything to go back to when 2NE1 were together, but she is starting to accept that they are not and she has a chance to continue alone, for now.

There are more technical singers in this contest, but every performance Bom has done has had weight to it, something I can't say I've seen from other groups separate of her. I'm certainly biased in that regard, but I really feel despite rankings, Bom is a true winner here. After, essentially, 5 years away from the scene, she has dropped new music, performed solo against a bunch of groups, formed some bonds with the younger singers and really recaptured a lot of that spectacle and confidence to perform, while challenging herself to sing songs she'd never sung.

Congratulations to Bom, the one from 2NE1 who had fallen farthest and been the most vulnerable, is the one that has come back swinging the hardest.
=
I badly want to go back to the time when 2ne1 was still a group,as a blackjack. Im crying so hard rn. I feel you bom,i feel the same way....🖤 2ne1 is the best
=
Things to note in this performance:

*Her red hair, homage to her 2NE1 days and their last MAMA stage

*Mic stands and color-customized 2NE1 mics

*The three dancers wearing the other three members' "Crush" outfits, which they wore in their last performance as a group

*The floor's design is 2NE1's Crush album art cover 

*The dance she did is the dance to 2NE1's In the Club
=
진짜 영상보다 눈물나려하는것도 처음이네... 투애니원때 생각하면서 쓴곡 같은데 퍼포먼스도 ㄹㅇ 미쳤다....
=
뭔가 지난 투에니원시절로 돌아가서 멤버들과 무대 서고싶은 마음을 담아서 노래하는 것 같네ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ찡하다..........
=
Only true blackjack can decode this performance.. Well done Bommie
=
Bom eu te amo demaaaais
=
Jusko yung mata ko.. Huhuhuhu
=
박봄님 무대는 볼때마다 새롭고 소름돋는 것같아요
=
I didn't find one thing that makes Park Bom Not the winner !!
=
When she says that she wants to go back and she dances like in 2ne1... OMG, this performance is a masterpiece! It's not even about her voice itself, it is the meaning behind everything. She is a fighter! Love you, Bom, you are a legend!
=
now we got minzy 😍 

2ne1 on mama2019 please!

and vote for bom!
=
대체불가
=
Don’t mind me just crying in the corner ..
=
이노래 들으면 투에니원 좋아했던 학생때로 돌아갈 수 없고 박봄이 멤버들 그리워하는것처럼 나도 그때가 그립다
=
그 안녕이라는 말 이라는 가사가 
2NE1 노래 안녕이라는 노래로 끝냈는데 그것도 해석되네
=
Tho park bom didn't win this, she will stay legendary and iconic. PERIODT!
=
왠지 눈물이 난다 😭
너너너 가 민지 시엘 다라다니.아마 그녀들 도 이 노래 들고 울었을거에요.
=
눈물나..
=
when she elevated i cried😭 she really wants to go back to their old memories as 2ne1
=
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
=
Go park bom go bom
=
her voice is just.... it's so unique and powerful, no one could EVER replace her. the emotions and everything that her voice carries, truly amazing and to me, she's already a legend and i am so proud of her😭❤️
=
아미친 투애니원 마이크 색깔대로 잇네

=
여러분 기뻐해주세요 채린이(CL)가 드디어 탈YG에 성공했어요!!!!!!!
=
We know that this song and this performance is to show that how much she miss 2ne1,she want to go back to their Era,when they were still together..
Oh my Blackjack heart💔
=
The microphones! THE MICROPHONES!!!!!!!!!!

=
이 무대가 왜 6위일까ㅠㅠ 내 맘 속에는 1등이다
=
I miss you 2NE1
=
She tried very hard. Support or Be quite, please.
=
This kind of song would never get bored even you hear this song for 10 years later.. right ?? Still curious who the girl tho.
=
I had goosebumps when they show the other 3 mics.. Bommie is trying to say that she's alone on stage without the other members right.  😢
=
"I still miss our last day together" 😢 awhh I feel her ...
=
" Just one more time
Just for one day
I miss you too much
I wanna go back "
=
Im ugly crying. This whole competition Bom really knows how to move people. Its sad,  I wasnt even a hardcore stan but like its....sad. Its very raw. Her voice is very gifted.
=
The goddess who sings the songs with her all heart and soul💚
That’s the real talent that is hard to find in kpop 👸(not only in kpop but also in world)
=
I died when that 4 mics appeared. Bring back 2NE1!!
=
Seeing her performing with 3 other girls breaks my heart.💔
Missin’ the good old days😖

=
목상태두 갠차나보인다ㅜㅜ넘멋진무대엿다진짜 언니사랑해요
=
Seriously, watching this performance makes my blood boil. You all can see how Bom really misses her members. 2NE1 did not deserve this. All of the members just seem so deprived of 2NE1 itself. If not only because of YG and the k-netizens, 2NE1 would still stand strong and we wont see our girls like this. This is truly heartbreaking.
=
Omg bom unnie slaying the final dance . So in love 🥰🥰
=
Queen 👸💕
=
이 무대볼때마다 투애니원때 생각나서 괜히울컥 ㅜ  몇번보는지 모르겠다 늘 응원해요 박봄 계속 노래하자!!!
=
본방보는데 눈물나다가 마지막에 뚝딱이는 언니 춤 보고 웃었다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 봄이 사랑해❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
표현너무멋있게 했다...
=
Go go go go unnie !! 💖💖💖
=
OMG I noticed 2ne1 mix
=
첫음부터 지리네..목소리 독보적이다 ㄹㅇ
=
It made me cry so much when I saw the 3 mic that represented the three members of 2ne1 miss them together so much I feel so sad😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bom did very very very well.
I miss 2NE1 soooooooo much.
=
I didn't notice the 4 microphones at first.
As I watching this performance again on the full episode and saw the 4 mics, I just started to cry like crazy.
😭😭😭😭
=
Bom is too brave to compete solo in Queendom considering her opponents are groups and new generations of great girl groups. She's a true Queen indeed never afraid to compete. 👑
=
빨간머리는 역시 박봄 댄스와보컬이 어울러지는 박봄 박봄음 2ne1이다
=
I cried when i saw the color of the mic 😭
=
I’m so thankful for what Queendom did to our beautiful lady.
=
색깔별로 마이크 4개뭐냐구ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 오늘 봄이 무대보면서 너무 뭉클했어 내 처음이자 마지막 아이돌 2ne1 다시 만나는 그날까지 4명모두 응원하고 있을께 난 영원히 블랙잭❤️
=
Clear as day and sad as the night. 😔
=
음원만 들었을 때는 그냥저냥이었다.. 그런데 이 무대를 보고 생방은 못봤지만 박봄에게 투표햇을 거라는 생각이 들었다. 박봄의 진정성이 느껴졌다.
=
노래해주신 것에 감사드립니다
=
She slayed even though her one in ear was out🤯
=
The dance at the end just killed me. Also, I love how she represents each stages of her life and also 2NE1 ❤️❤️
=
We want 2NE1 on mama 2019 stage who is here to support? Please like
=
너 너 너 세번 하는거 진짜 너무 슬프다 내 마음속 1위는 무조건 이 노래......
=
This stage is EPIC.   LEGENDARY.  

For those who are unfamiliar with the technical details of a live stage:  at 1:37, Bom Unnie starts having problems with her in-ear monitor.  This small earbud provides the music to the singer, so they can clearly hear what is happening on stage.  Please continue watching and notice Unnie's earpiece, which falls off completely at 1:53, just as the high note portion of the song begins, and the energy of the song is starting to build up.   This is the worst time to lose the audio feed.  

Still, Bom sings, emotes, owns the stages and doesn't show the audience the problem At this point, she cannot hear her backing audio clearly, and she is "singing blind".  At 2:50, Unnie has a break in the music and she discreetly tries to put her earpiece back in.  At 2:55, you can see her fumble desperatly with her earpiece, she cannot place it easily because her gorgeous nail art is in the way.  The high note is coming and she risks going out of pitch without her audio feed.  Also, at this point, she is already standing on the platform which will rise her up above the audience just as the song reaches its crescendo.  She doesn't want to miss the note and she is nervous for the finale that is coming. 

Even without her earpiece, she nails the high note at 3:26.  And the dance solo that follows - despite probably not being able to hear clearly.  This is the result of years of experience in front of an audience, and all the talent she has.  All hail the queen.  

TLDR:  Bom's earpiece fell out at 1:53, she delivers most of the stage without it, including the big high note.  EPIC.
=
The microphones were the colors of her 2NE1 sisters, my heart 💔
=
ok did   i just saw big bangs floaating lights?....ohhhh Bom i know we  missedd theem aand you guys too  T_T
So the othe Bom from the staaart is the old Bom.... T_T
=
The QUEEN IS BACK 
SCREAMIN* THOSES HIGHT NOTES FOR REAL 
BOM IS AN INSANE VOCAL!!!! 2NE1 WE WILL WAIT U
=
너무 감동적이고 멋진무대였어 봄아 ㅠㅠ 마지막까지 최선을 다해줘서 고마워 노래도 연출도 대박이야 ㅠㅠ 사랑해 봄아❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I got goosebumps the moment I saw those microphones 😭😭😭
=
" I WANNA GO BACK…" and with those 4-colored mics........YG take them back 2ne1 😭😭😭
=
I love Bom and I love 2NE1. This stage HURT. It was so damn good though. She gave a great performance and I love the song. It was very her. I'm glad she's had an outlet to actually be able to express some of the feelings she's had since 2NE1 disbanded.
=
I’m crying 😢 
Bom we miss you guys too! 
So so much!
=
THATS A LEGENDARY VOICE GUYSES!
=
she try to put the thing back to her ear so hard.
=
마이크 4개 있는거 보고 가슴이 너무 아렸음ㅠㅠ 감정 이입해서 보게되는 무대였어요...언니 최고야....
=
진짜 진심을 담아 간절하고 그리워하는게 다 느껴짐...
=
봄언니 사랑스러워서 어떻게하냐ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠ개멋나고 최고인것을...
아니 애초에 언니는 너무 클래스가 다르자너...
=
Park bom de cabelo rosa ja e tudo pra mim
=
My tears suddenly burst out when I saw the four mics. I know what they mean. 
The red hair. Their looks.

Lyrics "You,  you,  you. I miss you so much."
Bom pointed at three different yousss. 

The shiny debut album cover, the "In the Club" moves... 

She poured all her heart in her singing. Can I not cry? 

WANNA GO BACK
=
I was wondering how other groups will react after seeing the 4 mics. I was touched.... Park Bom, keep on fighting!! You're awesome!!
=
I miss 2ne1 huhuhuhuhu.......
=
Ohhh llore  al ver los microfonos tan solo al imaginarme a 2NE1 junto otra vez 😭😭  BOM hizo un gran trabajo  estoy orgullosa de Queen👑
=
뭔가 무대 바닥이 투애니원 미니1집 앨범커버같다..
=
I think Bom is the member of 2ne1 who miss the most being in the group :(
=
This stage was full of emotions 
She filled the stage with her presence, with her emotions 
Park Bom, you were great , you were awesome, amazing, beautiful 
Thank you
=
😭😭
=
noooo the three other backup dancers :((((((
=
독보적이네
=
💓

Thank you for being alive. Thank you Bom for not giving up. For killing the stupid knetz with your music. The bully knetz are killing kpop artist. Continue to spread your wings my queen!! Time will tell you gonna get back to time with the other members. 2NE1 #FOURever
=

=
Same as: Paul, and if you add John, George and Ringo you get The Beatles, and that's too big, the best ever! <3
That's the message^^
=
" I’ll stay here 
Waiting for that day you come back 
Wanna go back "
=
They really don't let go of each other, we missed you all. We're so proud to you bommie luv u!
=
I swear I was doing fine until I saw the four mic stands, microphones in each of the members' colors, and outfits similar to the ones they wore during their Crush era. Makes me miss 2NE1 so much, but also makes me very proud of Bom for continuing to sing and make music.
=
The more I watch this, the more emotional I feel. And those lyrics... 😭😭🔥💯😭 Bommie, I love you!
=
The way I cried during the whole performance 😭😭😭😭
=
Preciosa eres la mejor

Tuve el mismo sentimiento que en los MAMA2015 😭♥️

I'm crying so much. Bom, i miss 2NE1 too, a lot.
=
Park Bom is  the only winner of Queendom for me👑
The feelings of this song... The fact that she's talking about 2NE1... I'M CRYING
=
Omg when it shows 3 other member mics 😭😭 miss 2ne1 as a group
=
Amo essa mulher❤❤
=
It's PERFORMANCE ART!! Park Bom is amazing as usual!
=
Almost 1 million, let's keep streaming blackjacks & bomshells <3
=
This voice.. ♥️
=
Ur not the first in queendom but My heart :)
=
A lenda extremamente aclamada
=
As soon as i seen 2ne1's mic i started to cry 😭😭😭😭
=
WE WANT YOU BACK ALSO😭😭😭
=
I miss them too, Bom... I feel you 💕💕 I miss 2NE1 together 🖤 but support and love them all as solo artists  💕🔥
=
Bom! ❤❤
=
OMG I LOVED IT Park Bom VOICE WOW
=
damn im crying 😢😢😢
=
3:27 THAT HIGH NOTE❤️👌
=
I wanna go back too. Miss my OT4. 2NE1 4ever!
=
I luv you my beautiful boooom🥺💓💓 we wanna go back 2 :(
=
Wow omg Bommie 🥺
=
Rewatching this after mama2015 
Speechless
=
Best love lyrics ever
=
This is bom's screaming at as that she badly miss  2ne1, calling     her members and all the blackjack.. this performance hit us in another level..
=
가사에 “그리워해요” “안녕”... 각각 투애니원의 첫 번째 슬픈 장르의 곡과 마지막 곡이다. 0:49 2:09
=
Bommi! Never give up! Such an awesome performance! Please, be more confident!
=
Touch my heart always 😭❤️👍
=
What an amazing concept...I hope the other 2NE1 members see this and push to reunite someday
=
진짜 처음엔 이게 무슨 컨셉인가... 하는데 영상 댓글 보니까 와... 아니 어쩐지 스탠딩 마이크 그거가 4개이길래 2NE1 생각나긴 했는데 그외에도 다른것도 있을줄은... 진짜 무대보면서 와... 하고 있는데 이거 아니까 더 시선을 못떼겠더라고요...ㅠㅠ
=
Red is definitely her colour ❤️❤️
=
Bom unnie ❤😭❤😭❤😭
=
와... 진짜 투애니원 보고싶다ㅠ
=
Where can I order this, please?
=
Impecável! Merece TODOS os #1 dos charts! 😍😍😍😍
=
The references to 2ne1 songs, the stand in's for the other members in Crush era outfits, her In the club choreo, the red hair. If you can't feel how much was put into that performance then you're numb.
=
This song is beautiful!
=
With the trans... The song become surreal... Amazing!!!!
=
I cried with this song.
=
Omg!!! 2ne1 mic!!!
=
이게 전설이고 이게 퀸이지 역시 박봄
=
Siempre será la mejor 💕
=
Aşığım sana park bom🌻
=
옛날의 박봄으로 돌아가고 싶어하는거 같음..
=
IDK why I feel so happy to see her there on stage. ❤.❤
#2ne1 #blackjacks
=
Perfect
=
Why this songs slapped tho??
=
Park Bom wins, no doubt, the best! <3
=
박봄은 노래로 우네
=
뽐아 지금은 혼자이지만 언젠간 다시 뭉치자~❤️
=
Bom needs to master the falsetto altho the tendency to easily hit high note has prompted her to use it less........her vocal still has so much potential. Take a few month leaves after queendom Bommie!!! I love the faletto high note more than anything else!!! LOVE YOU BOMMIE
=
아직도 모르겠다 2NE1의 마지막이 왜 그래야 했는지
=
i started crying when i saw the mics, bom wanna us know how  bad she want 2ne1 getting back together just like what blackjacks want too🥺
=
4 mics that represents 2ne1 im crying ryt now
=
so sad……
=
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
빨간머리, 형광색바닥, 네개의 마이크, 가사 ..무대구성 참 세밀하게 짜여졌다. 뭔가 2010년이 그립다.
=
When the dancers showed up, I thought they're actually 2ne1 members... hope is killing me right here:')
=
This performance made me so emotional. Bom has been through a lot in her life but in this show you can see how her confidence has been growing so much on and off stage. This final performance shows her full power as a vocalist and as a solo artist. She owns the stage even when she's all alone.
=
When i see the colour of mic i know it will be 2NE1 

Although its only dancer but i know there dress up look like Crush era in mama award. 

I really need 2NE1
=
01:40 내 눈물버튼이다...이번곡 진짜ㅠㅠㅠ4인조인 그룹들 보면서 옛날 2ne1이정말 많이 떠올랐을것같다..언니는 내맘속의 1위니깐 하고싶은 음악 많이해요!!
=
디네는 봄이 춤추는 거 왜 안 말렸냐ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 울지 말라고 넣은거니ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 뚝딱거리는 춤신춤왕 우리봄 늘 멋있어
=
The microphones I repeat 
THE MICROPHONES!!! 
I’m sobbing 
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
I'm crying so much, i really wanna go back i miss 2ne1 TTnTT
=
😭😭😭😭2in1!!!!!!!!
=
This performance has so much meaning. Bom and her voice is so magical. And I can't stop myself watching this performance.
=
2ne1 세대여서 그런가... 눈물이 펑펑 나네ㅠㅠ
=
were the 2ne1 girls' microphones?


I loved it, she always rocking in every way possible.
=
She said in an IG live that the 너 너 너가 너무 그리워 part, by saying 너 3 times she means Minzy, Dara and CL. Quite sweet
=
im not a devoted fan of 2ne1 but seeing this performance made me remember the days when 2ne1 was still active. they need a reunion😢
=
Omg!!!!! She hit her high note!!!! So much memories from this performance... Even though her earphone dropped she still rocked!!!
=
Bom did amazing  ❤️❤️❤️ I didn't like the others performance besides mamamoo, this is great, but does bom have a different fanbase? I wonder now that she is soloist
=
마이크자리가 4개여서 2ne1 이 생각남...
=
봄아 사랑해 우리 퉤니원 완전체 기다린다❤ 순위는 낮았지만 팬들은 눈물 펑펑 쏟을만큼 멋지고 가치있는 공연이였단거 알아줘 이번음원 대박나자 뽐 사랑해
=
너무멋있어 혼자서 ㅠㅠ 저걸다하다니 박봄계속 노래해줫으면 ㅠㅠ
=
마이크 너무 슬프다 진짜 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 퀸덤 정말 나와줘서 고맙고 앞으로도 승승장구 했으면 좋겠다ㅠㅠㅠ
ㅠㅠㅠ
=
봄이언니 진짜 고생많았어요 영상편지 보고 오열하는 모습에 나까지 휴지 욜라 뽑아가면서 펑펑 울었잖아 빨간머리 진짜 옛날 생각나는데 마이크까지 하 내 수분을 다 짜낼 작정인거지 늘 최고의 보컬 보여주는 봄이언니 끝까지 팬할게요 많이많이 사랑해
=
Bom's red hair, her green mic, the back up dancer's outfits. . . .  "mention of Goodbye". . . so much symbolism in this song. I wanna go back too Bom
=
LA AMO, NO PUEDO DEJAR DE ESCUCHAR ESTA CANCIÓN
=
she nailed it.........QUEEN
=
Seeing the Red, Gold, and Purple mic back on stage with BOM holding her Green Mic again.... *THE TEARS Y'ALL!!*
=
It is not her era. But she's still giving a good fight and doing her best despite of everything. And that's the most important. We always love you, Bom. You're great 😍😘😭
=
Really beautiful
=
I feel like all these fangirl things has just come back to me. And I realize that my youth Bommie is now 36 years old. Gotta Be You was 5 years ago. And here she is, gathers all her courage to be back again. Thank you Bom <3
=
박봄님 행복하세요. 꽃 길만 걸어요.
=
혼자서 이만큼 무대 꾸밀 수 있는 건 솔로 가수들 말고는 진짜 힘든 일인데 너무너무 수고했다 우리 언니 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 최고야 크러쉬 앨범 내고 월드투어 돌 때 콘서트 보러갔었던게 진짜 내 인생 최고의 선택이었어 너무너무 행복한 추억이야 투에니원 사랑해 영원히 블랙잭할게 수고했어요 우리 봄 언니 ❤️
=
정말 음색이 너무 최강이다..
=
왜이렇게 인이어를 못껴ㅜㅜㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
This is what singing from the heart looks like
=
i wondered how can she didnt cry when she sang😭😭 i can feel the emotions by the screen only.. 
DAREALQUEEN is COMING!!!!!
i've missed them so much😭😭😭
=
Lenda ❤❤❤❤
=
The moment I started to see those members mic, I'm crying 😩😩😩
Bom unnie song's telling us that she miss 2ne1 also us Blackjack, we truly miss them so much. Miss you Bom unnie, Dara unnie, Chaerin unnie and uri maknae Minzy 😘 Fighting!
=
I really love her voice. 😍
=
AAAH I ATCUALLY THOUGHT 2NE1 CAME FOR A SECOND
I WAS ALREADY CRYIND SEEING THE 4 MICS SHE DIDNT HAVE TO GO THAT FAR
=
I started ugly crying when their mics appeared in the shot...2NE1 fourever <3
=
I felt her emotions!! Park Bom, we also miss 2NE1!! Thank you for such a heartfelt stage!
=
i dont even know how bom does it. its my first time hearing this song. yet her singing this make it seem like ive missed it soo much. and when i saw the remaining 3 mics i starting crying. its so sad to see how much she misses 2ne1. 
actually i was lowkey hoping that cl, minzy and dara would come on stage and grab those mics.
=
진짜 봄언니 하고싶은거 다해요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ ,, 이번 무대 너무 멋있고,, 한편으론 너무 슬퍼요 ,, 진짜 단 한번만이라도 투애니원 뭉쳤으면 좋겠어요,, 후배들 보면서 얼마나 그리울까요,, 다른 맴버들은 함께 해나가는거지만 봄언니는 혼자 하는거라 더 힘들태고 언니도 함께 하고싶은 맴버가 있는데 같이하지 못한다는게 얼마나 서글플까요,, 이번 노래는 진짜 너무 슬프고 너무 좋아서 계속 듣게되네요 정말 꽃 길 만 걸었으면 좋겠어요
=
This song is so sad😢 love you Bom unnie🖤 fighting!
=
Imagine if Dara, CL and Minzy performed with Bom 😭💚🧡💛💜
=
the final stage looks like their AON album :c
=
The lyric....omaigad😭😭😭
=

=
박봄 사랑해 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ흑흑

=
누구 실수인지 계속 귀에 꽂는 셋이 떨어지는데 마지막에 결국 놓으시고 열창하시는 모습이 보기 좋았어요...ㅠ
=
She looks so beautiful 😭😭
=
Queen💚bom, i love you so much....
=
I saw all the microphones and I thought "omg! They're back!" but it wasn't like that :c... still I love this performance :')
=
*That really hit home😢*

뭔가 되돌릴수 없는 돌아갈 수 없는 돌아갈곳없는 박봄.. 하고이어지는 느낌이야 봄이 외로워하지마.. 가사가 너무 자기얘기야 슬퍼 ㅠㅠ
=
Please give dara park a chance to perform too!
=
와... 첫공연 때만해도 더블링도 많이치고 숨도가쁜게 공연컨디션 안좋아보였는데 어느새 전성기 느낌으로 질러주네ㅋㅋ 이러면 마마무도 애기지 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
the  best final song of queendom for me
=
I cry. And i miss you too 2ne1
=
Would anyone tell me what colour is this (exact same name please tell me)?


Red
Royal red
Pink
=
I miss those days , those days with 2ne1
=
im cryingggg
=
Why I'm crying. 😭 This song is really for our 2ne1
=
Park Bom telling the whole world that she’s back... 😭❤️
=
3:43 I was crying so hard but when I saw her dance I laughed a little bit and remembered that she was the best dancer along with top at YG😂. Bom can beat minzy in free style dance😂💚I love her so much I know she will slay MAMA and maybe bring the girls😏🙏🏻
=
THE MICS!!!!!! AND COSTUMES!! CRUSH ERA. 2NE1!!!!!!
=
PARK BOM HAS THE VOCAL OF A LEGEND. I MEAN I WAS LITERALLY CRYING THE WHOLE TIME
=
she won that thing. change my mind.
=
The microphone kept falling out of her ear, especially in the end, but she continued anyway and slayed so hard! ❤️
=
Bom delivered such a beautiful performance! Idk about anyone else but I feel like her voice had definitely improved over this show and her vocals for this were incredible! Great visuals, loved the 2NE1 member tribute and the ending was perfection!
=
♥️♥️♥️
=
투애니원 얼른 재결합해달란 말이에요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 콘서트 가고 공방 갔던 그때 참 좋았는데.. 언제 또 좋은 기회가 있겠죠 기다릴게요 늘 응원하면서
=
the crush concept outfit of the back up dancer, the 4 mic ! its all about her group! i bawled! i dont care weer she win or bot! after what she been through , she’s bow back on stage that made her a winner a already
=
I honestly cried my eyes out seeing minzy's   short video message and was kinda hoping 2ne1 would do a surprise performance as OT4. Us blackjacks will continue to wait for that day!! ❤
=
봄언니 노래 너무좋아요!!!!
그런데 가사를 보면 눈물이 나와요..ㅜㅜ ♥2NE1이 생각나요 가사에 "너너너"부분이 민지 다라 씨엘이라면서요ㅜㅜ
언젠간 4명이 뭉친날이 오길바랄게요♥
우리 블랙잭들은 언제든지 기다리고있어요 너무나도 뭉친그모습이 보고싶어요 언니들이 무대에서 노래하고 춤추고 즐기는 모습과 우리 블랙잭을 사랑해주는모습들이요♥♥
=
보는 내내 계속 소름돋았다 어릴때 투애니원 진짜 좋아했는데 찡하다
=
Indonesia 

Kenapa hati aku hancur melihat park bom menyanyikan lagu ini,,,karna aku fan di jaman mereka dulu
=
진짜 봄언니의 맘이 잘 전달되는 노래였고 무대였음 ㅜㅠ 언니 다시 함께할수있으면 좋겠지만 그렇게 못되더라도 항상응원해요 ㅜㅠ !
=
I was already emotional when she started but as soon as I saw the gold mic I was a goner. Oh man....
=
봄아 정말 정말 사랑해 앞으로도 진심이 담긴 무대 많이 남겨주실 바래 ❤️
=
*Seeing the legendary mics of 2NE1 makes me WANNA GO BACK in time so much. I miss those times where they can be happy as four. I want 2NE1 back.*
=
투애니원 신나는 신곡 빨랑 나왔음 좋겠다 ㅠ
=
I’m crying so much right now Bommie we love you
=
the dancer like cl minzy and dara.

omg i miss them so much
=
수많은 그룹들 사이에서 홀로 있어도 박봄이란 존재 그 자체로 찬란해 보인다 한편으로는 많이 외로워 보여서 투애니원 재결합하면 너무 너무 좋을 것 같고... 박봄은 목소리만으로도 좌중을 압도할 줄 아는 진짜 가수다 너무 멋지다
=
The stage is about mama 2015 the light is about bigbang stage on mama 2015 too
=
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
=
Her voice...💚💚💚
=
When saw 4 mics on stage , I'm crying. 😭😭😭
=
Dancers part, they are from right hand side, Dara, CL, Bom, Minzy 😭😭😭2ne1 forever ❤️😘💕
=
예전 이효리랑 광고찍을때 박봄모습은 아에 없네 ㅎ ㄷ ㄷ ㄷ
=
Beautiful
=
ผมแดงทีคิดถืง
=
이 지진짜ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 가사는 왜 또 이렇게 슬픈건데ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 하...... 진짜 오늘따라 2NE1 많이 생각난다
=
Make me cry
=
We wanna go back 2ne1..  We miss you
=
😘💞
=
Cl is free now,hoping they will comeback  as 4..
=
not only the mic, all of the dancer cosplay CL, Minzy, Dara.
they did a little bit of choreography.
NO I cannot hold it
=
Makahilak man sab ta ani. 😭
=
cuando he visto los microfonos...uff que llorera
=
For 2ne1 😍😭😭😭
=
마지막에 단상에 올라가 박봄 혼자 추는춤.. 
In the club 첫 도입 안무고, 

In the club 첫 가사가 “너의 향기 이제 지우려고해” 임 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 찢통.. 
말은 그렇게 하지만 인더클럽 내용이 잊겠다고 말하지만 사실은 못잊는 슬픔이라 지금의 박봄의 마음이 어떤느낌인지 말하는것 같아 가슴 아픔 ㅠㅠ
=
Is it just me, or like during the other times when Bommie is watching the other girl groups in her resting/waiting room she always looks a little sad or longing about the old days when 2NE1 would perform and do this kind of things together, but now no moreee :''''''''''''''''(
=
I cried, in a specific moment, when bom unnie goes to the center of the stage and pops up the microphones each with the color of the members of the 2ne1 , I did not hold on i cried a lot , I still miss the 2ne1 .. all blackjack feels.. 2ne1we love you , no matter if gave disband we will always love you under all circumstances , we love you Good , Dara , CL , Minzy 2ne1<3
=
Stream this perfect stage reach 1M views like a gif for QueenBom 💪💪💪
=
진짜 많이 노력한게 보인다..눈물낭,..
=
This is a really meaningful. I really can feel the pain. Im crying so hard. Oh Bom we love you so much❤
=
팬도 아닌데 왜 이렇게 눈물나냐 ㅈ같은 사회생활 하다가 투애니원 노래 들으면서 친구들이랑 행복했던 중학생때 떠오름 ㅜㅜ 되돌릴수 없고 돌아갈수도 없지만 가끔씩 그리움
=
It's fine... Let's walk on the flower path at another way... Let's find it together 🍓🌼🌸❤💕
=
This is art, my queen!
=
I’m so proud of bom. Such a sweet baby. I’m happy how much she has done on her own and how hard she has been doing a soloist. Also, I’m so sad to see that she had dancers who were made to look like the other members. Breaks my heart 😭😭😭😭💔💔💔 blackjack forever!!!!
=
The 2NE1 tribute 😭😢
=
THIS IS THE TALENT OF MY PARK BOM!
=
when the three girls appeared, i literally cried.  it reminded me of the times  before 2ne1 disbanded. Bom's voice and expression really showed that she missed those days.
=
you know why park bom never become 1 place ? 1 of the reasons mnet surely is trash over real talent. 2 she is solo compare to other they perform as a group and has a huge fanclub. but after all. win is win and lost is lost.
=
I LOST IT WHEN I SAW THAT THERE IS 4 MIC STANDS!!!!!!!
=
I cry, when i see 4 mic
Minzy Dara CL Bom 💓
=
You did so well, Eonnie!! I really hope four of you will be able to reunite 💙💙💙💙
=
진짜 박봄 노래 너무 잘해얌 ㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 퀸덤 다들 너무 잘했뎡
=
Dude this is hella good!!!! I know this means so much for 2ne1 members and the fans. Thank you Park Bom!!
=
Yaaassss the red hair and the legendary mic!!!
=
i wanna go back too. when yg is a family :( 2ne1, seungri, bi, nam taehyun :(
=
You are still the queen, Bommie! 💕
=
O I miss those legendary mic hope to see the owner (2ne1 member) performing as a group again
=
Those mic's 😭😭😭😭
=
you are always my queen <3 <3 <3
=
진짜 존경.. 너무 멋있다
=
I don't know what I love the most about this performance. The iconic red hair, Bom's vocals, THE SONG ITSELF, the overall concept of this performance, EVERYTHING IS PERFECT. except for Bom's damn ear piece. HAHAHA.
=
박봄님 빨간머리 보니 go away때랑 can't nobody때 생각 난다ㅠㅠㅠ
=
She is miss her sisters (2ne1) .😭 . I wish will reunion  soon 😊
=
마이크 보고 바로 눈물 터짐..,
=
my dear BOM you really the elderly sister of 2NE1, you fight with 2ne1 I really hope that can see 4girls performance again in the future💕💕
=
아니 춤 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 기여웡
=
when 3 mics were standing there and empty... I started crying... I miss 2ne1...
=
Mama 2015 is back omg!!
=
This song hurt my feelings so much 😭😭😭 2ne1 please comeback 🙏🙏
=
Noooooo i liked the first thumbnail 😕
=
인이어 1개 빠져도 열심히하시네요..
감도우ㅜ
=
봄 사랑해 정말
=
Nanges. Habis skincare aku ㅜㅜ nyesal pakai awal2
=
Oowww, this song suit her so much.. Love you park bom
=
BOM I MISS YOU ALSO 2NE1.
PLEASE GOD BRING BACK 2NE1 TO US😭😭
=
When I saw the three mics beside her's...i cried. :((((((((( aaa I need a comebackkkk
=
2ne1의 마이크들 바닥엔 1집 앨범
=
Her iconic red hair. I really miss 2ne1
=

=
블랙잭은 존버합니다!🖤🖤

=
I dont think i can see this twice.
=
앞으로는 울 일 없이 잘 됐으면 좋겠어요
=
와 혼자서 너무잘한다 소름
=
Tears come when I saw the 4 mics...
=
또 한명의 거인... 박봄...
=
지금 이무대나오는 아이돌 앨범판매량 다합쳐도 투애니원에 안된다는 사실...
=
I cried like a baby! This breaks my heart! 2NE1 deserved so much better T_T
=
이번꺼 완전 최고였다 진짜
=
아 찡하다...
=
나 비록 2NE1이라는 전설이 있었는지도 잘 몰랐던 나이지만 박봄 언니 봄 으로 컴백 했을 때부터 알게 되어 반했었고, 노래 들으며 덕분에 위로도 많이 받았어요. 예전 2NE1 노래도 찾아 보면서 너무너무 즐거웠고
정말 노래 불러줘서 고마워요.
항상 응원합니다!
=
I need 2ne1 back plssssssss
=
박봄 여전히 멋져.
=
Park Bom did legendary perf every week.  this show unite all the group. A very rare interactions that can only be seen in end year award. I love to see their friendship. Ranking doesnt matters.fighting! *feeling nostalgic with the mic colors and when she drop the mic. CL and Taeyang also did that before. TT
=
Her best performance at queendom❤️❤️ This is how the original queen slayyyyy
=
퍼포머스는 엠넷 카메라구도때문에 제대로 보지못해서 모르겠는데, 노래는 박봄이 1위였다 진짜루 개좋아////
=
이거 본방송으로 볼 때 슬펐는데 팬 아닌데도
=
I like it that microphone
=
Im literally crying 😭.. im being blackjack since my elementary school..i miss 2ne1 so damn much😭😭😭
=
눈물이 나는 이유는 뭘까요...
=
Those back up dancers are very lucky they became 2ne1 members for a day haha
=
최고👍👍👍👍👍
=
This is definitely her best performance, I'm crying so hard, i feel like she finally found herself here❤❤ she is a queen🔥🔥
=
she'll always be one of the four queens
=
박봄 음색은 진짜 대박이다 ㅜㅜ
=
우리 언니 젤 이쁘다 언니가 젤 빛난다 항상 힘내고 언니 제일 사랑해
=
누나 진짜 데뷔 때부터 팬이였는데 항상 늘 응원합니다
=
무대 보고 울컥 했네요 앞으론 밝은 일만 있으시길 밝은 노래 하시는걸 듣고 싶어요 그간 힘들었으니 박봄님 밝은 노래 하시는걸 보고 싶어요 그땐 또 다른 의미로 울컥할거 같네요 ㅋㅋ 다른 멤버들도 밝은 모습보면 더 좋아 하시지 않을까요? ㅎㅎ 응원합니다 화이팅!
=
공민지가 먼저 탈퇴한것도 자의가 아닌가요??
=
봄아 니가 최고야 너무 예뻐
=
Omg the 2NE1 references in this performance had me shook :(
=
omg 4 mic belongs to 2NE1
=
솔직히 제일 잘했다 오늘
=
look who is crying right now?

👀
=
Is there anyone think the last pose is similar to the finishing pose of BEST “OMG”?
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
THE IN THE CLUB CHOREO AT THE END WITH THE OH OH BACKGROUND VOICE IM OMFG STOP PMG 🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
마지막 어깨춤만 없었으면 오늘 우승감이다. 노래로는 아무도 못이긴다는걸 제대로 느낌
=
i've been crying a lot when i watch this performance . its because , i have been supporting 2NE1 since their debut . seeing how much they've struggled just to be on top , going through hard time , harsh words and even worse , their company doesn't treat them right is like a hard life but they still manage to stand and show us that they can do it . when i watch this performance , i cant hold my tears cause i can feel how lonely Bom is and i hope people will keep supporting her and a solo artist and support the other member too <3
=
We need a 2ne1 stage on MAMA 2019.
=
WHEN SHE HIT THOSE HIGH NOTES.  I WAS LIKE GET IT GURL!!!!!
=
Beautiful Bommie
=
I want toooo... Please 2ne1..

(Eu tô chorando😢😢)
=
그냥 다 자기노래로 만들어 버리네;;;;;;
=
박봄은 퀸덤에 나온 목적이  뚜렷했다..  순위경쟁하러 온게 아니라 투애니원을 그리워하는 진심을 전하려고 결심하고 출연한거 같음..  
퀸덤나와서 부른 모든 노래에 진심어린 감정이 담겨있고 ( 지금와서 한 노래듣다보니 yg 떠오름 ㅅㅂ.. 양씨 겨냥한노래인가.. ) 
특히 마지막무대 ..ㅠㅜㅠ 고음 지를때 너무 슬픈 나머지 비명지르는 것처럼 들렸고 마지막 인더클럽 춤도 일부러 마지막에 저 퍼포먼스를 넣은거같음 혼자 열심히..  멤버들과 함께 추던 시절을 회상하면서 이젠 혼자가 된 박봄이지만.. 열심히 추는 그런 느낌을 받았음..  진짜 큰 의미가 있는 춤...
 그리고 팬이 아닌 이상 이번 무대에 숨겨진 의미들을 잘 모를거 같네요...아 슬퍼서 눈물이나네 ㅠ  눈물흘리다 갑니다ㅠㅜ.
=
No... 😭 I can't la
=
ㅜㅜ 나의 찬란하면서도 가장 아팠던 그 시절에 행복과 즐거움을 전해줬던 그 시절을 함께해줬던 걸그룹이자 세상 모든 사람들이 아는 멋진 사람들..
박봄님의 노래를 들을 때 마다 그때의 추억들이 생각나서 저도 모르게 마음이 먹먹해지네요
 
이 무대를 보면서 홀로 단단하게 담담하게 나라를 이끌어가는 여왕같은 느낌이 들었습니다.
 여왕은 정말 박봄이지않을까 하는 생각을 들게한 무대였습니다.

그런데 이 무대보면 이사람들이 짱이고 저 무대보면 저사람들이 짱이고 에잇 몰라 그냥 다 제 마음속 여왕하시고 별 거 아닌 제 통장 가져가십쇼!!! 충성을 다하겠습니다 ㅜ ㅜ

모든 출연진들 다 멋진 분들이고 제 마음속을 다 치고 간 분들이고 저에게 여왕들이고 1등이라는 우열을 가릴 수 없다고 생각합니다. 그냥 다 멋지거든요 어떻게 숫자로 매길 수가 있겠습니까.. 휴우.....  

결론 : 퀸덤 최고 짱 다들 지금보다 행복하고 흥했으면 좋겠습니다 2도 나오면 더 좋구요..^^ 
아 현기증난다 무대 전체적으로 5번만 더 보고 자야지
=
투애니원을 아는 세대라 행복합니다ㅠㅠ봄 언니 응원해❤
=
존나 맘아프다
=
My friend asked me why am I crying while I’m watching this video.....😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
For me even though you did not win but BEING PARK BOM IS LEGENDARY no one can beat that you make a history and no one can also do that
=
ELA FEZ A HIGH NOTE SEM RETORNO CARALHO ESSA MULHER É FODA e eu só fiz saber chorar agr
=
Extraño tanto a 2ne1😭😭

=
Queen 👑
=
Park Bom Park Bom Park Bom Park Bom Park Bom Park Bom Park Bom Park Bom Park Bom Park Bom Park Bom Park Bom
=
1:35 아아.. 멤버들 스탠딩 마이크 색상 보이자마자 아 투애니원때로 돌아가고싶고 그리워하는구나 뽀미언니의 노래 고음 듣고 더 슬퍼짐 퓨퓨ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
게다가 3:40 의 안무도 IN THE CLUB 안무....ㅠㅠㅠ
=
The meaning of this stage concept was so deep :( when the 3 dancers as CL minzy and dara ? OMG. I can feel what she felt right there!! Bom was struggling too much. She is one of a wonder woman *applause*
=
I still hate the fact that YG destroyed 2NE1. I'm crying rn.. You can see how much Bom missed being with 2NE1
=
I got goosebumps when she pitches her high note. I was like "YASSSSSSSSSS BOMMM YASSSSS!!!!!!!"
=
진짜 난 최고의 무대였다고 생각해 언니 너무 고생했어 ❤️
=
I'll be here
Till the day you come back
I'll be waiting for you

-Park Bom, waiting for her girls to come back.
=
I cried so hard while watching this performance. Once a Blackjack will forever remain as a Blackjack, I guess :)
=
This hurts soooo much ㅠㅠ I’m soo sad... all those little details of the performance, she really puored her heart out into this.. 

ahhh how I miss those 2ne1 days too...
=
IM SO EMOTIONAL WHILE WATCHING THIS TO THE POINT THAT I NEEDED TO EAT A CHOCOLATE TO BE HAPPY AND SMILE😭
=
In terms of performance, this is the least fancy, but the song is the catchiest.
=
그 안녕이라는 말에 숨어울었던 그 밤이라는 가사... 투애니원 마지막 노래가 안녕이라서 너무 와닿는다
=
The moment I saw the gold, purple mic. My heart goes like😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Park Bom's high note really got me goosebumps. 2NE1 FOUREVER😭😭❤❤
=
This really makes me cry and sad. 😞
=
when I saw the dancers it reminds me CL, DARA and MINZY and I burst to cry it reminds me 2ne1 :'(
=
the most emotional performance for me. i cried
=
I MISS MY QUEENS😭 THE LEGENDARY 2NE1! COME BACK PLEASE
=
I know how much bom misses my noona’s! HOPE 2NE1 Will definitely have a comeback. Blackjacks is feeling me rn 😭
=
Listening to the full album and I love her song the most, the feeling and the voice tho, still a legendary queen 👍
Eventho I must admit she is not as strong as before, her pronouncation is kinda off.... so fighting!!
=
Ohmygod the coloured mic is 2ne1😭 i haven't forgot that, i miss them😭😭😭❤
=
Bom unnie! I cried when the 3 other girls came out with iconic 2ne1 royal-like outfit. the lyrics, the story, it fits perfectly. im crying rn. wishing 2ne1 to reunite and come back. i love you bom. fighting
=

=
무대보면서 투애니원 생각이 나서 뭉클하더라고요 노래도 너무 좋아요 앞으로 꽃길만 걸어요💕

=
음색 독보적이다
=
for a sec, i tot 2ne1 was on stage...T.T
=
라이브맞아요?눈코입때 목쉰거 다회복했나봐여
=
I truly missed the times when CL, Dara, Minzy and Bom performed together. The last time that they actually show people how powerful they are is during MAMA
=
I reallly like her voice...so unique
=
I love you Bom.
=
There's just something about Bom's style that makes her songs very sentimental. This stage was so personal to her too.
=
You don't need to win. You don't need trophy. You don't need any competition to prove you are a queen bcos you already proved it since then. You already won without any battle bcos you keep fighting until now. You are powerful as an artists and you've showed a lot. You are at your best, and those best will never fade in people's heart. Thank you for being our BOM ❤🔥
=
OH MY GOD WHEN I SAW THOSE MICS LINED UP I INSTANTLY CRIED 😭
=
I'm crying..... who's cry with me.. click vote..
=
아... 언니... 진짜 눈물나요...  마이크도.. 너 너 너 대사도.. 거울 연출도... 그냥 다 찌통.. O<-<
=
Aren't y'all proud of our Bommie? She's so precious, she must missed those 3 amazing woman she used to perform with :(
=
와 마이크도 백댄서도 다 각각 투애니원인거 너무 슬프고 진짜 그렇다 시간은 빠르고 매섭기도 하지...
=
To happen to put an artist as talented and creative and so filled with emotions in a show like this is such an amazing experience!! Park Bom was always the sweet soul in 2ne1 knowing that it a girl crush powerful girl group but she always succeeded in making it all fade and create the ballance we all fell for with her magical angelic vocals!


I'm so glad she's got to show how emtional she is! how talented she is! and how ready and preapred she is to give it all when it comes to things she loves and appreciates starting with her most beloved group 2ne1!!
I couldn't help but cry and smile at the same time watching this cuz I know as a 2nd gen Kpop fan how is it for all of us, how do we feel.. cuz Kpop is not like any other Music industry.. we get hurt and miss our faves so much!! it sometimes lead to depression and extreme sadness because as we grew up, we were always casted out and only KPOP made us feel there's something fun and colorful and amazing to live up to and feel happy and enjoy!!


I'm so happy she's doing her best to relive all of that and can't help but be happy for her and support her from the bottom of my heart cuz she deserves that!! she really does!!


PARK BOM IS A LEGEND!!
=
2NE1😍😍😍😍
=
유앤아이 처음 들었을 때의 감동이 다시 느껴져요ㅠㅠ
=
이번 무대 너무 좋아... 진짜 이건 1위 해야 돼
=
NAO AGUENTO MAIS SOFRER CARALHOOOOO EU TE AMO DEMAIS 21FOREVER 💕💕💕💕
=
I wasn't a Park Bom fan before Queendom started, but I'm definitely one now! That was a fabulous performance! Love the song!
=
I want her to be with her members again, she's so sad T_T
=
투애니원 현역시절 아는 사람 중에 이 무대 보고 머리깨면서 울지 않을 수 없는 사람은 없을듯.....
=
She dedicated that song for cl,dara,minzy and blackjacks fans.. 
I Miss them so much im still hoping were back as a 4 member 
Goodjob bommie saranghaeo😍😘 🇵🇭
=
😭😭😭😭
=

=
음원도 너무좋아서 계속 듣게되는데 무대연출진짜 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅠ너무 슬프고 퉤니원 멤버들이 보면 너무 감동적일것같아 ㅠㅠㅜㅜ
=
유일하게 좋아햇던 가수이자 그룹인데 이번 무대보고 다시한번 추억에 젖었네요ㅠㅠ 민지언니 영상편지보고 봄이언니 울때부터 같이 울엇어요ㅠㅠ 투야니원 기다릴게요!
=
와~~~최고!! 엄청  좋아졋네   얼굴에   제발    제발  손데지말아다오  사십말년까지   안  늙는다  내가  늙어봐서  안다,  칠십  넘음  제데로 늙지,,,,봄이야    굳이  춤출생각마라   소리만내도  황금알이네  아 ~ 소리진짜  좋네   아델보다  더 좋다,
=
Tell me I am not the only one crying while watching her performance.
=
This song is for 2ne1 banwagon and also to her co-members gosh miss niya na talaga ang 2ne1 💔
