I feel like Minnie will be very successful solo artist
=
Most of Thai origin Kpop idols are main dancers yet we have Minnie who is a great Main Vocalist.
=
I... I hate this voting system. I'm so mad right now. Hyejeong and Minnie I'm so sorry. You guys deserve better.
=
I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS PERFORM RANK THE LAST😭😭
=
Let's take a moment to appreciate their voices.

*Hyejeong: has strong, unique, beautiful and on-point nasal voice that can complement with anyone's voice, has strong voice but don't outshine her partner, has nasal voice but is pleasing and soothing to the ears.*
*Minnie: has a wide variety of voice, she can manipulate her voice depending on the genre and mood of the song, can harmonize with anyone.*
*_Hyejeong and Minnie: unlike other duos, they are the only duo who sung like a duo. No one outshines each other. They are not overpowering one another's voices. They both have nontypical voices so it is fresh to hear. The song choice is great and the interpretation is amazing._*

*_Elvis and Neverlands must be proud of these two._*
=
여타 아이돌그룹의 해외멤버들 대부분이 얼굴마담인 경우가 다반사인데 아이들의 민니랑 우기는 노래 곧잘함. 더구나 둘다 음색이 정말 좋음.
=
yet, Soyeon's never mistaken to sent Minnie into vocal for Unit...she always believes in Minnie, and says, Minnie's voice is something you cannot always heard in Korea...
=
퀸덤 3대 리액션: 오마이걸 승희, AOA 혜정, 아이들 우기 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I like Minnie's lazy singing style
since Latata
It fits her
=
혜정 저렇게 노래하는 사람인즐 몰랐다....... 민니는 이 계기로 힙합에서 피쳐링이나 힙한 노래 많이 했으면 좋겠당ㅠㅠ 민니 저 표정이나 제스쳐나 느끼는게 넘 좋음
=
Hyejong isnt even AOA main vocal and but look at her... she slay so hard
=
민니가 외국인이라는게 안믿김 발음 어색한거 1도 없고 음색 개쩔어
=
Only minnies voice can make you like a song youve never liked before
=
the girl who did that demonic intro during latata can also be this angelic. that's it.
=
민니 음색 안개 껴있고 풀잎에 이슬서린 새벽같아..
=
I actually don't know how this become 3rd...
=
혜정은 뭔가 여성스러우면서 예쁜 목소리면 민니는 정말 묘하고 이 세상과 전혀 다른 듣고 또 듣고 싶은 음색이다..민니랑 딘 콜라보하면 쥑일 듯
=
혜정은 뭔가 이별노래st 정통 발라드 하면 진짜 오질것같음....
=
no one picked them and now they are shining like this
they need to win
=
Minnie if she go solo with that kind of voice I think could she easily attract public attention, ofc with good song. She have such unique, soulful voice... Almost like heize, bibi type voice.
=
전소연이 그래서 아이들 노래에 민니파트를 그런거 많이주는구나 음색돋보이게 하는 파트들
=
나는... 민니가 인스타그램 그 자체같고 혜정이 인스타그램 사용자 같음...
=
민니는 진짜 특유의 목소리가 사람을 유혹한다말야.. 일반 사람을 네버랜드로 만드는 마술.. 진짜 신이 준 저 목소리 부러움ㅠㅠ
=
this song is soo minnie style like so vintage
=
Hyejeong, this is not fair she’s so beautiful and even sing this beautiful ? She’s perfect idol !!
=
imagine this getting 3rd, joke voting system
=
발음도 찰저..누가 태생이 태국인인줄 알겠냐고..영어도 잘해..한국어도 잘해..
=
민니 이렇게 음색 좋은줄은 몰랐다 수진이랑  소연이 너무 튀고 강력해서 눈에 안띄었는데 강렬한 둘 속에 묻혀있던 숨은 보석이었네. 그리고 신기한게 태국사람이라는데 얼굴도 한국인같고 (태국특유얼굴느낌이 안보임) 발음도 정말 좋다. 흥해라
=
No one:

Solar to every performance:
👁👃🏻👁
      👄
=
Minnie should have been a soloist. This girl’s voice is just so out of this world.
=
I’m so proud of Hyejeong, she matches with Minnie so well and her voice is so UNAPPRECIATED, she did SO well with the falsettos and setting the somber and soulful tone. This duet wouldn’t be amazing without her.



Also you guys must know, this duo was the two who didn’t know what to do the most unlike the other groups, they got their arrangements done later and decided on the song a lot later than the other group and their chemistry was not amazing at the start but they pulled off this performance so well so I’m very glad and happy about that.
=
민니가 진짜 ... 퀸덤에서 알고 제일 호감..
=
선배인 혜정이 많이 배려한 곡선택 같음 
진짜 선배답고 언니답다 혜정 너무 멋있어
동생 수줍게 끼 부리는거 봐주는 언니같아
=
I feel like they both have a different Instagram aesthetic going on. Minnie a more chilled back, cool vibe and Hyejeong a chic and elegant beauty guru.
=
민니야 성대 누드립 보험 들자 보험료는 언니가 두둑히 낼게 너는 노래만 하면 돼........
=
혜정이는 얼굴 예쁘고 몸매 되고 피지컬   쩌는데 팀 내 보컬도 담당하고 무대 밖에선 개그캐 매력쩔고.. 지금껏 안뜨고 있었는게 신기할정도
=
목소리 합만 보면 이팀이 젤 좋은거같음.... 같이 부르는거 넘 좋다
=
Hyejeong sounds like Korean RnB singer while Minnie sounds like western one so in conclusion this combination makes me dying.
=
Minnie has a ability to ruin my ears. She makes my ears like her voice only😭
=
Always been a big, big fan of Minnie's voice, but today,  also Hyejeong's
=
민니는 소울이 넘치는 목소리고 혜정이는 감성이 넘치는 목소리인데도 서로 진짜 조합이 너무 좋았다....
=
민니 이 곡이랑 찰떡이다 아니 스타일링도 존나 찰떡이야 ...... 메컵 소화력 무엇
=
Minnie is that girl who just made your heart skip a beat!!
Agree?!
👇
Edit: thanks for the likes✌️
=
I really like Minnie because she have that charm, her style and voice good for me.
=
Queen Hyejeong is really a revelation. Such a queen. Aoa queens
=
This is the song you will play on Starbucks on a relaxing day.
=
1:57 왜 아무도 이 드립에 대해선 말이 없는거야 미주 드립 개 잘쳤는뎈ㅋㅋㅋ 보고 존나 쳐웃음ㅋㄱㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄱ
=
이 무대를 보면 민니가 본인 음색과 아주 찰떡같은 선곡을해서 물만난 고기 같고 혜정은 그냥 이프로그램 자체랑 물만난 고기임 ㅋㅋ
=
음색만 봤을땐 박봄이랑 민니가 하고 혜정이랑 케이가 하는게 더 잘어울렸을 것 같음
=
개인적으로 이 팀의 어우러짐이 가장 좋았다.
=
둘이 음색 합이 너무 잘 맞다 서로 튀지도 않으면서 부드럽게 서로를 감싸주는 느낌
=
Remember Hyejeong isn't even AOA's main vocal 
But look at her she is amazing 😍😍
AOA is one of the best vocal groups in kpop history
=
솔직히 인스타그램은 누가 불러도 좋지않을수가 없지만 민니 목소리가 진짜 딱 사람을 끌어당기는 매력이있네... 게다가 혜정도 이번기회에 노래잘한다고 알리고 갈수있는 기회라서 좋은 무대였다고 생각함....
=
Mijoo is a whole mood lmao, I'm dying when she's said *"She's so cool, it's not Minnie, but Unnie"* LMAO
=
Hopefully the audience will give them justice lol their colors blend so well together AHHHHH western and korean singing voice is a good mix
=
민니란 보컬을 알게됐고, 혜정은 새롭게 다시봤다 그냥 무대보며 목소리 들으니 입가에 미소가 저절로 생긴다 최고의 무대
=
민니 음색 너무 좋다 진짜
근데 혜정이 얼굴 왜이렇게 이쁘지??ㅠㅠ
새삼 다시 반할거같네..
=
why is no one talking about hyejeong i'm beyond sad she KILLED this performance
=
Minnie has the perfect R&B voice that literally melts everyone
=
민니는 노래도 노랜데 무대 제스쳐 하나하나가 존나 좋네 완전 프로자너 저런게 진짜 무대 더 살려줌
=
Hyejeong’s sharp and R&B voice and Minnie’s soft Alternative R&B voice gives me such an eargasm 😍
=
When Minnie sang her the last words, its touch my heart
=
Minnie needs to sing more RnB/indie music and Hyejeong OSTs
=
나는 혜정 목소리 너무 좋다 
뭔가 너무 슬퍼
=
This duet should win. They were the dark horse for this unit. Hwasa and kei was also good, however eventhough hwasa tried not to overshadow kei but she still looks dominant on the  stage and Kei's image and voice were too pretty for that song. During practice, Hwasa told her not to sing it prettily and just relax but Kei didn't really match the style of the song as what Hwasa want. While Minnie and hyejeong did perform as duet and they voices really compliment each other. That what makes them as the best duet on that nite. Here are my expectations:
Should win : Minnie and hyejeong
Will win : hwasa and kei (cz they are more popular)
But I still want AI to winnnn #fingerscross
=
I think the BEST one. The one who really sings as DUO
=
this is weird but i really want minnie to sing in french
=
민니는 정말 인스타그램이란 이 노래랑 잘맞는음색인듯 글자하나하나 엉긴다고하나 하여간좋아ㅜ 혜정은 뭔가 공허하게 허공을보며 읊조리는거같아 커피한잔과 텅빈새벽 둘다 너무좋고 잘어울려
=
I cant believe they ranked last! Mnet give this girls some justice! İt was the BEST performance ever i heard...!!!
=
the best think about minnie is shes never outshined her partner, even when with yuqi n miyeon.
=
민니가 진짜 대단한건 말안하면 그냥 한국인 같음..노력을 진짜 많이 했다는거ㅠㅠ
=
how could they be on 3rd place? they should win this. QUEENDOM ISN'T FAIR
=
개인적으로 제일 보컬끼리 잘어울리는 팀같음
=
솔직히 혜정이렇게 이쁜줄 몰랐음.
에이오에이에 있을땐 노출,섹시컨셉을
주로하다보니까 옷이나 그런거에 신경을
더 쓰게되다보니 얼굴은 조금 덜봤는데
이번에 노래나 의상이 노출이나 막 좀그런느낌이
없으니까 어울리기도 하고 예쁜듯..
민니도 음색이 귀에 잘들어오는듯.
또 그룹에 있을땐 잘몰랐는데 노래도
잘하고 얼굴도 예쁘고 좋은듯,,
=
민니 우리나라 사람 아닌거 지금알았음 한국말 왜케잘함?ㅋㅋㅋ
=
혜정 음색이 이렇게 좋은지 몰랐지... 시발 모르겠고 사랑해요 다 일 등 먹으세요 보컬에서 일 등을 어떻게 골라 ㅠㅠ
=
I hope they win. ❤
They really sang like a team and not two vocalist mashed together
=
민니는 음색이 끝내졌고, 혜정은 감정 표현이 잘 됐네.
=
민니의 소울 중성적인 매력이 느껴짐..
=
omg who is the girl in the white blazer. her voice is so soothing and fitting to this song
=
민니 발음 진짜 좋다.... 모르는사람이 보면 한국인인줄
=
dang minnies really getting a reputation from her sunbaes, shes being called "unnie" and was compared to bom. she seriously has a bright future. she slays every song and makes it her own
=
진짜 음색 조합 미쳤네 진짜 너무 잘맞아 둘이
중간에 계속 분위기 바뀌는 것도 너무 좋아ㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 둘이 등 기대는 건 또 모야ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
1:13 That is that classic Minnie vocal texture that is fantastic. It's silky, but coarse at the same time 🔥🔥
=
Minnie proved her versatility here. She could've blended easily to either bom or hwasa but was neglected by them..im a blackjack and i also love hwasa, but i hope they regret not partnering with minnie (sarcastic).. 😁😁😁
=
Nevermine. Even they are 3rd place, but i still thinking that they are 1st place already.
=
hyejeong is really good voice. and her face when sing a song. really beautiful and cool
=
i feel like minnie and hyejeong is the only team that truly sounds like a 'duet'. they harmonize together instead of just focusing on showing off their own talent
=
Minnie did a good job,she is so dreamy.
=
Minnie killed this by her piano skill and charming voice and my bias Hyejeong makes it perfect by her sweet voice and gorgeous. So damn good! Show them you both have good skills.
=
I  really fell in love with Minnie because of this, How can her voice be like that 😍
=
이번 퀸덤은 에오에한테 득이 되는 방송인데,민니 음색 개죠아ㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏ
=
이번 계기로 AOA도 의상과 섹시춤으로 몰고가는게 아니라 목소리가 들리는 노래로 소속사가 방향을 좀 바꾸면 좋겠네. 민니 음색 진짜 특별하고, 혜정도 넘 좋다아아~~ 노래하는 혜정장군 좋아^^
=
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA i'm gay and this HURTS they're so hot in the way they carry themselves and how sensitive their singing is
=
I hope Minnie and Hyejeong can make a project at the future. Love AI
=
i like how hyejeong’s voice is so unique
=
Hyejeong's voice are so attractive and beautiful. She's really good vocalist. I'm in love with her rigth now. For minnie no doubt she's really good though. Her dreamy's voice make feel calm and relax.
=
This song sounds the most technically challenging to me tbh. The melody goes into flats so often must be very hard to pull off without going off tune and then to harmonise it wow. Salute to these two ladies!
=
Minnie will collab with Wengie on a song named "EMPIRE." M/V and the song will be released on october 18th! Please show a lot of love for the song!
=
They’re like real sisters. I’m glad they teamed up with each other. Their voices are perfect for each other
=
Ok but how the hell did this only get third?!?! Was the best imo
=
혜정님도 잘 하시지만 민니님이 이 곡이랑 음색이 너무 찰떡이네요.. 나중에 솔로로 한 번 듣고싶다 ㅠㅠ😭😭
=
so sad that everyone only talks about minnie even when hyejeong killed this as well
=
THIS DID NOT DESERVE LAST PLACE
=
Okay, winning duo is here. Forget about the votes, forget about the other competitors, Minnie and Hyejeong are winners in my heart
=
Minnie and Wengie (Australian Youtuber/Singer) are collabing. The song "Empire" and the video will be out on 18th this month.
=
아 이프로는 진짜 아오아의 재발견임;; 난 진짜 그냥 댄스그룹정도로 생각했는데 각각의 재능이 엄청남; 역시 연예인 아무나하는거 아니당.....크으으으
=
"Minnie's Breathe"

everyone: EHOWOOAHHAEEHOHGWEYJOHFEWGJOWOAHHH
=
Minnie’s voice soothes my ears after hearing a harsh complaint from my client
=
I wanted them to sing together from start and even tho they weren't each others first choice they slayed🔥
=
혜정이 너무 잘한다 리허설땐 긴장했던거였나...
=
This is so Minnie's style omgggg this is amazing
=
개취로 보컬 중에서 아아가 제일 좋더라
=
Man since her debut, minnie really catch my eyes and ears..
=
THIS IS A FRICKING HARD SONG
KUDOS ON EXECUTING IT LIKE THIS!!
=
Minnie must named god minnie. How could she seem so relaxed like that while she is a rookie. She did great on the stage, her voice, her expression, everything is perfect. I admire her a lot GOD MINNIE 💕💓💓💓
=
I feel like Minnie’s voice would be so perfect for a collab with Dean on this song
=
전소연이 민니를 스페셜메인카드로 쓰는 이유가 있었네
=
I think Dean has to see this .. omg this is legit so good
=
They placed 3rd, I can’t believe it. Their voices are amazing. That’s all right, they’re the winner for me❤️❤️
=
I really like how this show's performances are bringing the best out of these artists! Its really cool to see sides we otherwise might not have seen!
=
Still can't understand why did this came 3rd, I like this performance the most...
=
근데 아이들멤버들은 진짜 1년차맞음? 개인별능력치들이 개사기급인데
=
i didn’t realize how minnie was such a lil baby omg
=
/after performance/

Omg Hyojung: ‘She doesn’t look like a rookie right? She seem to have more experience than us ‘

Minnie, Get all the praise 🥰
=
this is the best one! they deserve to win... they're not even the 1st Vocalist in their group but they slay so hard and show their vocal without overshadowing each other...
=
I enjoyed most 
1.- Only Bom 
2.- Hwasa overshadowed
3.- Was an actual dúo <3 i loved minnie and now i love hyejeong :3)
=
*swear i could listen to minnie's voice for hours or even forever*
=
"This is not Minnie, it's Unnie," Mijoo, 2019
=
I'm in love with Minnie's voice 😍
=
I need a full cover by Minnie 😭🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💘
=
"she's not minnie , she's unnie"
-Mijoo , 2019
=
Minnie Minnie 😭💗💗
=
Their duet is God’s gift
=
i truly think this duo did the best, their voices are stuck in my head~~~ so pretty together
=
minnie's smile at end really warms my heart
=
Minnie's voice is so unique. Soyeon even said Korea doesn't have it.
=
Not just the voice but considering this is her third language! Minnie is amazing
=
At 3:05 is when Shuhua's bias switched from Soojin to Minnie, lol
Minnie is a bias-wrecker, even in her own group! 😵
=
Hyejeong is tall, beautiful and she also sing well with unique voice. 
She blessed. 
And minnie.. what should I say about her. I believe that she will be the most popular solist when she get her solo ♥
=
I watched this show coz of mamamoo but end up fall in love with GIDLE.
=
뭔가 혜정이는 완전히 이별한 사람이고 민니는 이별한 사람에게 조언해주는 언니같다
=
honestly, this was the best vocal performance from the three pairs. their voices really complemented each other and the song fit them both so well.
=
I need a daily fix of this cover by Hyejeong & Minnie every day now.
=
HYEJEONG AND MINNIE DID SO GREAT!! that just ruined me 🥺🥺 i love them so muchh
=
Minnie has better vocal techniques than rose ,
=
사실 민니 음색 좋은 건 알고 있었는데 혜정 음색 좋은 거 이번에 처음 알았다 모랄까 ,,,  끈적끈적하구 ,,,  목소리 개섹시해 ,,,
=
i want minnie to cover more songs
=
Minnie sua linda ❤
=
they r the no 1 in my ❣️
=
SARANGHAE Minne❤️ i came to know u more in Queendom
=
민니가 원곡에서 음 몇개씩 비틀때마다 내 오징육부도 같이 비틀리는중,, 악 민니야 너무 잘해ㅜ 천재니,,?
걸어나올때 진짜 숨 멎었자나 얼굴천재 음색천재,,
=
before you guys said minnie SHOULD go solo , g idle need her . she need them
=
I think this performance the best among the others 🤔
=
In oct girl group brand reputation (G)I-DLE is no 1 with 15.6M . This is highest points for girlgroup in 2019 and the highest for both girlgrouos and boygrouos this month the link words are (soojin.minnie.hot.like.queendom) 
The power they hold
=
I love hyejeong even more😭😭❤❤
=
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 중간에 찬미가 오 잘하네 혜정 이러길래 아무 생각 없었는데 찬미 막내아님? ㅋㅋㅋ
순간 선밴줄 알았네
=
Hye jeong voices ❤️ she came to the right show, and show the world her talent while her company didn’t doing their part
=
Sigo esperando a que esté en Spotify :,)
=
This performance you can play again again and again
=
Minnie, you are the coolest idol
=
아니 혜정 저렇게 예쁜데 노래도 잘 하네 근데 aoa노래 주구장창 들으면서 혜정 음색 몰랐던 내가 제일 물음표다....소속사 뭐냐 진짜  민니는 뭐 말할 것도 없음 인스타그램 그냥 민니 노래임
=
Hoping that these 3 performances will be released on Spotify ❤️ they were all Soooooo goooodd💯❤️
=
When they will release the recorded version im really addicted to their voice. I come here everyday you know just to listen AA team
=
i dont know but only this performance felt like "duet" for me... really good blend together and that harmonizing each other. i fell in love with theem!🌸💖

THE LEFTOVER BECOME THE LOVER💖💖💖
=
How can this performance be in the 3rd place!! I'm upset!!
=
아니 민니가 어떻게 태국인이지.. 발음이 토종 한국인인데..
=
혜정 진짜 이쁘다.OMG HER VOICE SO GORGEOUS,EVEN LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL. thank you for the program to show me how much she has a potential !
=
Omg! minnie is incredible. I like her voice.
=
Hyejeong perfaaaa ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
I'm in love with Hyejeong×Minnie 😍😍
=
이팀이 젤 조합 좋다 ㅅㅂ 한명은 청아 한명은 음색 미치고
=
AI is the BEST DUO! They never outshine each other! They blend, compliment and they both shine in their own ways! 
To Minnie and Hyejeong, it could have been darkest when you two were left out! When nobody chose to be with you! But you showed Queendom and to all of us, stars shine brightly in the darkest hour! You slay! You have our love and  respect! We love you! Nelvies ❤❤❤
=
This will forever be my 1st place for this round 😭 Such beautiful performance
=
Oh no .they place 3rd but you both are our winners💜💜
=
Hyejeong voice makes me goosebumps.. I love her
=
other teams just picked the best sounding voice but they didnt pick the one that suited them the most. to me, minnie and hyejeong is the only team where i can truly feel their voice blending into a harmony
=
Hyejeong's voice is sooo angelic (╥﹏╥)♡♡♡♡♡ she has such amazing projection
=
Hyejeong is perfection
Her vocals oh god I want to hear more
=
Minnie fits in soul/R&B genre so hard, I wanna hear a solo song by her in this genre
=
Minnie´s voice is like the feeling when you eat the sweetest chocolate and Hyejeong's voice is like the most delicious coffee in a rainy day <3 love both <3
=
To me, this was the most cohesive unit. Which is ironic because they were not each others first choice.
They sound like they have been doing this together for years and the voices and style match well.
Bom and Hyojung, the looks and voices did not mesh.
Hwasa and Kei, that looked like an award show special performance.
But Minnie and Hyejeong look and sound like an actual duo.
=
Hyejeong and Minnie had a great duet. 😍
=
This performance is so dreamy and magical especially the beginning. I keep coming back.
=
This sounds better every times I listen to 💞💞💞
=
I cried listening to their voices blend, that’s how beautiful this duet is
=
Let's talk about how hyejeong just slayed this sh*t despite being the 3rd vocal in her group. (With choa)
=
This is so beautiful, the voices blend so well together!
=
Minnie voice 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
The most underrated lead vocalist of her group, HYEJEONGAAAA!!😱😭😍 Im soooo proud of you, baby girl!! This performance made me cry!😭😭 Good job for showing them that you're not just an eye candy, girl. Thank you too Minnie for this great performance, you're sooo good as well!😍You girls did an amazing work!!❤️🥰
=
도입부 듣고 민니 압승이라 생각햇는데
혜정이가 눈에 더들어옴 뭐지?
=
민니 목소리랑 선곡이 완전 개 찰떡이네
엄청 힙한 목소리
=
When can we get this on Spotify or Itunes? please i need this to be my jamsss everyday
=
Minnie and her voice is so precious ❤️✨
=
Yuqi saying minnie is good she feels like crying
=
1:12 that “oooh” Bom let out... yeah I felt that 💜
=
Why not anyone talking about Hyejeong's harmonyy..
=
I love minnie from Thailand🇹🇭❤️
=
Wow Minnie's voice 😭🥰
=
As far as I want Bom and Hwasa to succeed, I love this team and the song they chose. They make me love again and again Dean's song and they harmonize so well look at Hyejeong 😍 and Minnie. They are proffesionals!
=
This is one of the best cover inqueendom 😱😱😱😍 Hyejeong and Minnie vocals are perfect 👌 both of them make a great team 😱😱😍😍😍💯💯👍👍👏👏
=
민니 솔로앨범 내면 인기 엄청많을 스타일의 음색..
=
Jeong and Minnie ARE JUST PERFECTION TOGETHER. THE VOICES ARE SO PURE AND JUST AMAZING
=
Minnie's voice is just so beautiful ahhhh love you girl ❤❤❤
=
민니 목소리 정인+볼빨간 사춘기 느낌난다
=
Minnie's dreamy and calm voice combine with Hyejeong's sultry voice is AMAZING. Out of the three i think theirs feel like a real group/duo.
=
아이들은 다 실력이 진짜 좋네
민니 미쳤네 혜정도 너무 좋고
너무 잘한다 둘다
=
Love their voiceeee!!! So stunning🔥🔥
=
This was the best performance out of 3, like what's the point of having a duo unit when one overshadows the other, but these two perfectly killed it. Plus, the song is the hardest to pull off out of the three
=
1:11 Park Bom going OOOOH~~ is so adorable omg
=
I think Korean judges have different ear regarding competition. .
=
Minnie gives this song that cute, hopeful vibe with her natural smile and energy. Hyejeong brings soulful, somber mature vibes.
=
One with cool swag & d other sexy swag. Such a good combi. I love hjong but I never really heard she sing alone other than in aoa. Good opportunity here
=
I really like this Duo, they voice so beautiful, unique n I feel really relaxing when I listened instragram  this version n also dean vison too.
=
compared to their anxiety, this performance is really really good!!! I was really surprised.
=
is she the same minnie that cast the love spell on first stage?????
=
난 이번경연에서 민니가 제일 좋더라 목소리랑 노래선곡이 너무 잘맞는듯
=
Love Minnie’s voice soooooooooo much
=
Minnie's voice is so pretty :(  
I'm gonna cry at my room corner now :')
=
Need to listen this version on Spotify 🤨🤨🤨
=
민니는 여성 보컬중에서도 독보적이다.
=
둘 다 음색은 말할 것도 없고 클로즈업 계속 되는거 보니까 혜정장군은 전형적인 한국 미인?같이 생겼고 민니는 요즘 인스타에 뜨는 힙한 미인상? 아니 뭔 느낌인지 아시잖아요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Hyejung and Minnie are super girls! Their vocals daebak!

hyejeong has such a pretty voice!!! i dont think she gets to shine very much so this is such a nice spotlight
=
I really love Minnie's dreamy voice. I'm crying now. 😭😭♥️
=
이 팀은 호흡으로 무대 살렸네...
=
HYEJEONG YOUR VOICE IS SO BEAUTIFUL !!! please give her some recognition too
=
Minnie I love you .. shuhua reaction at 3:06 is priceless hehe
=
im sorry but, minnie looks so small next to Hyejeong 😂
=
Minnie's voice stuck in my head. Actually, I'm just music fan of gidle but now you are turning me into your big fan.
=
Let's just say Minnie can harmonize with anyone.   I appreciate her ability to change her vocal tone and style to fit different songs and to truly accompany other vocals.
=
I love minnie voice since she cover "gravity" 💓
=
3:46 Solar make me laught so haaaaaard!!!
=
Minnie’s voice so amazing
=
Minnie’s voice ♥️😍♥️
=
MINNIE🖤HYEJEONG
LOVE THIS SONG
LOVE THIS COUPLE
👇
=
why is no one talking about hyejeong? my baby’s voice is so gorgeous and the two of them combined are so powerful 🥺👉🏼👈🏼
=
ouf ouf oufffff this hurtsssss so good xD
i wish this was just a collab program cuz i love hearing my queens be able to show us their styles and explore more vibes with each other !! so gooooddd
=
still don't understand why they've got 3rd place
=
minnie's voice😭💜
=
혜정이 진짜 너무 놀랬어 이렇게 잘하는애를;; 이정도면 소속사가 능력없는거 아닌가
=
Minnie is a rare vocals in kpop along with hwasa, but thank goodness Instagram happened . 🥰🥰
=
I want them to be no.1. This song is difficult to handle and to me their voices match one another the best. When singing duet it is very crucial that one does not outshine the other too much. Well done and Minnie I love your voice :)
=
Minnie's face and personality are very cute, but her singing voice is very special, in stark contrast to her cute face. There are really no words to describe this great. I'm addicted to Minnie's voice. Hyejeong also sings very well. Their combination is excellent. Unfortunately they cannot be no1. But the two of them did well. 아아 짱 👍🏻❤️ for me AA is the best ❤️
=
their voices combine perfectly with the song, i feel relaxed watching this
=
Who wants Minnie’s solo album 🙋🏻‍♀️
=
I'm so proud of Hyejong... Thanks for this show's performances, Its really cool to see sides we otherwise might not have seen.
=
MINNIE I LOVE YOU SO MUCH😭😭❤💜❤💜❤💜❤💜
=
JIMIN is literally me right now in bed watching this
=
literally made me cry as I know they lyrics translation and how they perform it omg
=
민니 목소리는 진짜 몽환적이다 해야되나 말로 표현할수없을정도로 매력적이고 독특한 음색
=
I felling in love with Minnie's voice ~♡
=
❣️❤️ I can't get enough of this cover 😍
=
HYEJONG SO GOOD!!
❤❤
=
OUR LEAD VOCAL HYEJONG SLAYING!!❤❤
=
퀸덤으로 인해 맨날 주목받던 멤버들 말고도 이름도 몰랐던 멤버들 매력 노래실력 볼 수 있어서 너무 좋았음. 민니는 진짜 음색무엇???
=
I didn't know how hyejeong was a great vocalist until now...
=
I looooove this beautiful song 😍😍
This is the first time I've heard of these beautiful singers 😮 someone tell me their names ?
=
MINNE. I LOVE U BABY. YOUR VOICE IS LIKE GOLD😭
=
Look, I'm just gonna say this. THEY SLAY!!!!!!! LOOK AT THAT GIRL HYEJEONG she nailed it. And  Minnie her voice is so unique
=
민니 자기 음색이랑 시너지 효과나게 의상이랑 제스처 잘 한다
=
ughh hyejeong is so PRETTY
=
Yuqi look so proud omggg😭💞
=
This is ♥️
=
This is my favorite song 😁 I'm so proud of you Minnie.................................. 
I will always  support you 🤗🤗🤗
=
Perfect!
=
So​ Good​ ❤️🤟🏻
=
Can we please talk about Hyejeong like she isn’t even the main vocalist. She sounds so beautiful, elegant, and full of emotion. Come on like, Minnie wasn’t the only one singing right?!?
=
i had no idea minnie was gonna look so smol when next to hyejeong 😂
=
근데 혜정 목소리가 좀 더 생각보다 저음으로 탄탄해서 저음으로 잡아주고 민니가 좀 더 고음이라 민니가 중심으로 했으면 혜정이 목소리도 더 잘 들렸을 것 같긴 한데 혜정도 이렇게 노래 잘 하는 줄 처음 앎, 매력적인 목소리네.
=
" She's not Minnie, she's unnie"
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Minnie should have another (one more) single with Hyejeong AOA. This duet is really really incredible. I love both of them ❤️ Their sounds are so good and blend so well.
=
MINNIE’S VOICEEEEEEE
=
2:13 화음 맛집..
3:17 미쳤어 민니 ㅠㅠ

진짜 가요대전 같은 곳에서 또 보고싶어..
=
혜정장군은 중간점검? 때랑 노래 부르는 게 많이 바뀌었네 진짜 열심히 연습했나봄 복면가왕 보니까 노래 진짜 잘하던데
=
Minnie's voice in the beginning is the reason I keep coming back to this performance
=
Beautiful voices💕
=
They blessed my ears
=
This cover has gotten me crying... the original one was already so sad..... this just makes the whole song more depressing....
=
Minnie's voice really suits indie genre😂✨
=
Upload this version in Spotify, Apple Music, ITunes, plssss
=
That intro by that girl is amazing!
=
I’m a MAMAMOO fan.. but I really think this was the best performance
=
민니는 그리움에 잠겨있는 사람같고 혜정은 체념하고 정리하는사람같아 ㅠㅠㅠ 둘 다 너무 잘한다
=
Minnie's voice is just too beautiful
=
민니 주변 카메라들이 인스타 올리려고 사진찍는 대중들 모습인가?
=
They really did so great
=
my two favs 😭
=
민니 목소리부터 죽었지만 제스처와 표정이 너무 좋았다 ㅜㅜ 그리고 혜정도 목소리와 감정이 무대에 빠지게 해줘서 둘의 케미가 너무 좋음 ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 그리고 퀸덤은 당장 혜정민니 타로보는거 영상 올리도록. 그리고 지금 당장 퀸덤2제작발표회 해주세요 ㅜㅜㅜㅜ대충 민니때매 나 죽어라는 내용
=
love hyejeong's voice ~
=
I love their voices together
=
I love this so much~~~
=
Team Underdog did us proud 😭
=
소연이가 찐으로 민니 자랑스러워하는 것 같아서 넘 보기 좋다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 리더로서, 프로듀서로서 얼마나 자랑스러울까
=
I need minnie's lipstick
=
I freaking in love with Minnie's voice💕💕
=
Did Dean justice! Amazing cover!
=
Why is no one talking about hyejong. I think she was brilliant
=
민니 음색 진짜 좋다ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 거기서 딱 혜정이 잡아주는 느낌이라서 너무 좋다.. 둘이 그냥 다 씹어먹어라
=
OMG!! #G_I_DLE topped this months brand reputation. From #20 last month to #1. From a 2.2M to a 15.5M. I'm so glad more people are waking up and starting to know these 6 talented girls coz they deserve it. They haven't even fully snapped yet. I'm so proud of our girls.

this was absolutely magnificent
=
Minnie's voice! 🥰❤ I can listen to her sing all day.
=
Hyejeong’s  voice  so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
=
혜정이 돋보적인 민니 음색 되게 잘 받아주는듯 ㅠㅠ 둘다 개짱이야.. 아니 근데 중간에 아이들 미연? 너무 이쁜데...???
=
Perfect combination...love both of them
=
Woow what a duet <3 I'm really glad Queendom enables vocalists to show their abilities because sometimes it can be overshadowed in their group's title tracks or songs in general :) Like I knew Minnie was a good singer from her vocals in (G)I-dle's songs but I didn't know she was THAT good omg :o
=
My favorite thing about this is the support everyone gives each other. It is indeed a beautiful sight to see. Kick buns girls! Tear it up in Queendoms! 👊
=
minnie oppaaar
=
민니 왤케 힙해 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 음색 독보적이다진짜
=
Best performance of the episode
=
Minnie and Hyejeong got robbed!!
=
THEIR VOICE OMGGG
=
I'm getting goosebumps really
=
If minnie and hyejeong doesn’t win this I don’t know what’s a masterpiece anymore


update: i really don't get how our AA Team placed 3rd BUT THEY ARE FOREVER THE 1ST IN OUR HEARTS❤
=
My two biases on one stage
=
Minnie you are good and you're number one as always ❤️❤️ neverland
=
I love minnie’s voice❤️❤️❤️
=
I stan this duo hope they will sing together again. Great harmony and amazing vocals. 💕👏👑
=
찬미가 ㅋㅋ 혜정이보다 세살어린데 자꾸 혜정 혜정하는거 웃기네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 잘하네 혜정~
=
오머 키차이 겁나 설레
=
Their voices fit really well together
=
I want this on iTunes 🥺💛
=
Minmin<3 Hyehye<3
❤️Ah Ah❤️
=
와 근데 혜정 가사 틀린거에 음 안겹치는 거보니까 쌩 라이브 같은데 둘다 개미쳤네 개잘함...
=
I love this duo and also their performance 💕💕💕
=
Me literally screaming like Mijoo XD
=
1:54 "민니가 아니라 언니야" ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I love the reaction of idle members 
Shuhua is speechless, Yuqi's just enjoying the show.
While Miyeon is like, "Damn Minnie, I'll give you this one." 😂
=
how i wish to have a voice like them
=
Me encantó esta presentación😍😍😍😍😍😍
=
No 1 in my heart .
=
Minnie, hyejeong , AA, keep my heart. I'm done with it I don't deserve it
=
아니 큐브 외국인들 녹화를 어떻게 하면 왜 노래를 안 할 때 더 한국어를 못함
=
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS I LOVE THIS SONG
=
Hyejeong's voice 😍😍😍
=
아진짜 민니 완벽해....진짜러 사랑한다ㅠㅠㅜㅡ
=
Wow, I've been so preoccupied with Kei and Hwasa's performance that I didn't really grasp how amazing this performance is... 
Just... damn.
=
민니는 유명인인데 주변에 진짜 친구는 아무도 없는 사람같고 혜정은 사랑하는 사람한테 사랑 다 퍼부어줬는데 배신당한 사람같아서 더 곡의 감정이 잘 살아나는 것처럼 느껴짐..
=
Minnie soulful voice 💕
=
everytime i look at hyejeong i remember her okey dokey yo during their whisper challenge in weekly idol with her shirt that has the word idiot written on it and i end up not taking her seriously but tbh she and minnie snAPPED SO HARD i-
=
I actually thought this performance would go second
=
근데 진짜 그동안 노래로 주목받는 외국인 아이돌이 있긴했었나?? 발음도 내가 여태 들어왔던거랑 비교불가급으로 정확하고.... 솔직히 에이 그래도 외국인인데 그런생각 가지고있었는데 좀 놀랐음...👍
=
민니 진짜 미쳤다 ... 팝송 빼고 지금까지 부른 노래중에 민니 음색 제일 잘 보이게 해주는 노래인 것 같음
=
As a rebel: I approved this!
=
Hyejeong Queen AOA fighting you're the best forever
=
HYEJEONG PRETTY VOICE
=
I can't belive they no.3. They should no.1. Mnet aaaaa!!!
=
솔직히 제일잘했음...
=
Hyejeong! You did so well dear. Your not just beautiful but also talented. Im proud of you. Elvis is proud of you.
=
Minnie voice is so pretty 😭😭😭
=
Sometimes.. When i see minnie it reminds me of Scoups from svt
=
1:56 she joined Soyeon in the unnie club.
=
민니의 독보적인 음색과 혜정의 청아한 목소리가 너무 합이 어우러짐
=
나한텐 이 무대가 1등이야ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
민니 진짜 이거 한번만 완곡해주라ㅜㅜ 너무 듣고 싶다
=
These two fit together so well, they better win!
=
Minnie is so good! But both did well. Good job, Hyejeong.
=
다들 민니 음색 얘기만 하는데 민니는 메보라서 아이들 활동할 때도 노래 잘하는게 충분히 보였음 근데 혜정은 AOA활동할 때는 (지금은 없지만)독보적인 메보와 실력보다 섹시로 밀고가는 소속사에 묻혀있던 못 보여줬던 실력을 보여준 것 같아서 내가 다 기쁨
=
i love you minnie! I love G-idle ♥️
=
let’s just say minnie won’t have to worry when idle disband because i think she’ll have a very successful solo career
=
number 1 in my ❤️
=
Proud of you Minnie ~ love you <3
=
Btw Minnie only debuted last year. So she will improve even more. I really hope this duo wins.
=
Honestly this needs more viewwws 😏😏😏 don't sleep on this performance people
=
퀸덤 보면서 민니와 혜정의 매력을 알아서 너무 좋다ㅋㅋ 민니 음색 저렇게 좋은것도 성격이 저렇게 귀여운것도... 혜정이 예능감 좋은것도 노래 잘하는것도... 사랑해요😘
=
1:49 이 부분 너무 좋음 ㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜ
=
Perfect combo 🙌
=
Look at Minnie enjoying herself 😍
=
1:56 침투력 무엇 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아무 생각 없이 터졌ㄷ네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Hyejeong's long legs and high boots are killin' me!  And then her sexy voice....omo!
=
In this generation, Minnie's husky vocal type is more appreciated but veteran Hyejeong with her sweet raspy voice won't let herself be overshadowed. I love how they managed to harmonize perfectly, there's many collab stages like this where the singers tried to outshine each other and totally ruined the whole performance.
=
1:38 찬미야... 같은팀 너무 남처럼 얘기하는거아니닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Instagram - DEAN
Instagram - IU cover
Instagram - Miyu Takeuchi cover
Instagram - Hyejeong & Minnie cover
Both of them are so good!
=
Im amazed by both of their voice!
I also hope will cover the full song 
Her voice is so amazing
=
Hyejeong ฮเยจองร้องดี แสดงสีหน้าได้ดี สวยเท่ด้วย ทั้งคู่ร้องเพาะ และทำให้เพลงดูเท่ มินนี่ ฮเยจอง ดูเป็นศิลปินมากๆ มีความมั่นใจ มินนี่ ตอนลุกมา ร้องเท่ๆ มียิ้มบ้าง เล่นบ้าง เอาเวทีอยู่  คือดี
=
i love the voice color of minnie so beautiful
=
MINNIEEE AHHHHHH MARRY ME
=
Minnie's voice suit this song so much 😍 😍 😍
=
아오 혜정언니ㅠㅠㅠ 음색 무슨 일이야 사랑해 진짜ㅠ
=
진짜 민니가 노래부르면서 씨익 웃을때
심장 내려앉았다...언니 사랑해...
=
They harmonize well! I really love Minnie's voice, that lazy voice. And even Hyejeong she did well. Love these two. ❤
=
Oh my minnie’s voice
=
2:52 뜬금없이 웃겨 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Their harmonisation 😍
=
Elvis and Neverland! Let's be Friends! Minnie is so Cute while Hyejeong is so Sexy!
=
1:50 초 에서 복잡해 개 좋다
=
1:37 어우 잘 하네 혜정
같은 팀 뭔뎈ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
This is one of my favourites songs, they did very well.
=
민니의 끝음 처리가 너무 좋다ㅠㅠ
=
팀명이 아아라서 그런가 민니는 산미있는 아이스 콜드브루같고 혜정은 따뜻한 카페라떼 생각난다

=
How is this sounds better every time I listen to it. 💖
=
화사 민니도 좋았을것 같지만 그래도 누구 하나가 더 돋보일것 같은데 혜정 민니 무대보니까 서로가 서로를 돋보이게 해주는것 같아서 아쉽지가 않은 무대인것 같아 보기좋은듯
=
Jenderal Hyejeong❤️
=
혜정아ㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏ 내가 많이 아낀다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
FUTURE COLLAB!!!
=
They are first for me ❤️❤️❤️
=
me encanto <3
=
They should've won.
=
와 이 무대는 진짜 최고다
=
난 얘네가 진짜 짱이었응
민니 진짜 개스윗
=
Minnie's swag as she walked out kinda reminded me of IU during her BBiBbi performance.
=
i love this performance. both have beautiful voices ❤️
=
아 진짜 둘다 너무 잘해 ㅜㅜ 너무 좋아
=
มีใครเป็นคนไทยที่มาเชียร์minnie บ้าง
=
I fall in love with this song version 😍😍,,instagram 🎶 instagram 🎶 instagram 🎶.....and start to look at minnie and hyejeong..
=
김민니 내가 너 이렇게 될 줄 알았어 우리 낌 라타타부터 음색 존버했걸랑 전국민 전세계사람들이 우리 낌민니 잘난 것 좀 알앗으면.......... 나 방금 너한테 반했어.....한 365728번째로
=
Minnie so cute 😭😭😭😭
=
hyejeong ❤
=
It's just wonderful.
=
Minnie is doing great 👍🏻!!
=
민니 음색 좋네. 여자아이들 음악적으로 보여줄게 많은 그룹인듯
=
1:41 미연이 시강......너무 이쁘쟈나
=
1:48ㅠㅠㅠㅠ최고
=
민니 씨익 웃을때 너무 멋있고 너무 예쁘고...
=
솔라는 화면 돌릴때마다 표정이 똑같아ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ OoO
=
Hyejeong slayed with vocals and visuals. How to be like her???
=
둘의 음색이 너무 좋은데, 특히 '사랑노래가~'  이부분이 정말 좋아요~
=
ミンニの声ってホントに落ち着く😌夜寝る前に聞いて寝たい
=
3rd what....this is worth 1st rank...
We all know 🐍🐍 did something wrong
=
Minnie very perfect
=
I just relise that all members in vocal unit and dance unit are korean excpet minnie, (G)I-DLE really trust in Minnie.
=
MINNIE lo hicistes genial!!!!!!!! ,mi niña hermosa❤ ," voz de ensueño" I LOVE
=
3:07 보다가 깜짝 놀랐다 너무 좋아서ㅠㅠㅠ혜정언니 날 가져요
=
Beautiful!  The leftovers turn out to be the main course.  They both did awesome.  Minnie's voice is sublime, and Hyejeong is a surprise gift.  Their vocal matched so well.  They were the only act that actually did a duet where they sing with each other and match harmonies.  As far as Hyejeong - Who said AOA can't sing w/o Choa?
=
진짜 음색깡패...옴걸 응원하지만 민니혜정 조합이 1등 찍을듯
=
0:42 1:50 민니 너무 예쁘다 진짜....
=
혜정이 확실히 짬빠가 있다보니 감정표현이나 표정등등 너무 좋은것 같아요ㅠㅠ
=
i need minnie to release her solo!!!!!
=
Omg minnie voice 🌸❤️❤️
=
We all know that Minnie can harmonize her voice with Yuqi in their cover of  Scared to be Lonely but I'm shock at Hyejeong at 2:21 - 2:29. She harmonize with Minnie really well <3
=
Can you make a album for minnie please. She's worth to listen💕
Whos with me? How many then?
=
1:55 천재닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
민니 직캠만 봐서 잘 몰랐는데 혜정도 표정 처리 진짜 감각적이라 해야하나 노래에 쏙 빠지게 만드네
=
민니가 가진 음색 더 진하게 할 수 있는데 자제하고 있는 거 같음 혜정이랑 어울려야 되니까
=
Hyejeong is truely an angel.... fightinggg AA  😍😍
=
헐 민니님 음색 실화야 ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 넘 이쁘다 얼굴도 음색도 피아노 치는 손가락도 걍 다 이뻐이뻐❤️ 아이돌 되어줘서 고마워요!
혜정님은 진짜 너무 이쁘시다 진심 얼굴이 대박 ,,,, 얼굴이 넘 이뻐서 노래가 묻히는 듯 ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 노래 넘 잘부르신다 ㅠ 아이들 AOA 다 흥하자😍
=
aoa 입덕 프로 맞다니까 이거 .. 혜정 사랑해 ....... ㅠㅠㅠㅠ❤️
=
1:55 She is going to be gay
=
Minnie love youu, you're so great
=
Their voice really match each other, and made it a beautiful song.
=
Hyejeong comeback!
=
minnie's voice omg!
=
When minnie started to sing l got goosebumps, her voice so angelic and hyejeong voice so sexy
=
민니 진짜 신인 맞냐ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
둘이서 곡하면 히트칠것 같아..... 너무 좋아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
0:45 씩웃는거 개쳐발린다...
=
민니 ㅠㅠ 진짜 목소리 보물이다❤️
=
Hyejeong’s voice is beautiful like her visual.
=
진짜 좋다....
=
와 혜정 진짜 ㅠㅠ음색...ㅠㅠㅠㅠ너무좋다
=
QUEENDOM YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THEM! I mean they shinja shinja nailed it! ❤️ The duo we need. 💯💕✨
=
보면 볼수록 민니 너무 귀엽네 ㄹㅇ
=
No hate to the other units but I feel that this unit when they were singing they didn’t outshine each other. Which I felt with the other two unit
=
I could feel the emotion so much. They’re so talented... wow... ❤️😭
=
혜정 노래 잘한당... 민니는 음색이 진짜 ㄷㄷ
=
they sound so good together even though they were not initially want to be in the same unit !!!! minnie's voice is <333
=
You sing so well , Minnie
=
Nightmare ver. had me so freak out. I need to come back here to calm down 😅.
Minmin♥️Hyehye♥️
=
Minnieeee❤️❤️❤️
=
*Hyejeong, you did very well*
=
민니랑 딘이랑 콜라보했줬으면ㅠㅠㅜㅠ
=
투명하고 맑은 혜정 음색이랑 뿌옇고 몽환적인 민니 음색이랑 많이 다르면서도 진심 잘어울린다ㅠㅠㅠ 화음 부분 진심 좋음
=
CHILLS😫🌬❄
=
민니가 아니라 언니ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
맞아 원래 멋있으면 다 언니랬음
=
민니 음색...혜정이 음색...첫소절 부터 소름 돋아버렸어...
=
Love minnie so much ❤
=
진짜 ㅋㅋㅋ 민니음색을 따라갈 사람이 없네
=
Minnie so cool~~😎
=
And solar ..her eyes is always like its gonna popped out lol
=
이게 왜 3등이야 ㅜㅜㅜ
=
WOW... 
Voice Minnie
=
와......... 서로 화음 주고받는 거 찢었다............ 둘이 너무 잘 어울리네...........
=
3:40 민니 손 흔드는 거 왜 이렇게 귀엽냐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 노래할 때랑 대화할 때랑 갭차이 너무 귀엽고 사랑스럽고 몽환스럽고 신비스럽고 혼자 다 해 민니ㅠㅠ
=
혜정ㅜㅜㅜ목소리 너무 좋았어요
=
민니진짜 잘한다  혜정도
=
혜정도 이번에 매력을 잘 보여준 것 같은데 나는 민니 진짜 뭔가 표정도 프로같고 목소리고 미쳤고.. 혼자 나중에 완곡 막 프리스타일로 막 해줫으면 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 반했어요..
=
민니는 외모도 목소리도 몽환적이네 저래 노래하고 있으니까 존나 아티스트같다 더 커졌으면 좋게ㅛ다
=
Omg Hyejeong's voice is too sexy and chilling and relax, just like I'm in a tea room!! Minnie's voice very suit to this song, they did very good job!!
=
they deserved the first or second place! ):
=
I love this. A duet indeed!
=
Minnie !!!!! 😢❤❤👑✨
=
아니 민니 음색 소름돋을 정도로 개좋다 진짜 와ㅠㅜ혜정 목소리도 듣기 좋고 완전 짱..ㅜㅠㅜ
=
민니 제스쳐도 완전조아ㅜㅜ
=
혜정x민니 콜라보해서 음원하나 내주면 안대...?개좋아 진짜ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 💜
=
퀸덤 통해서 그동안 설현초아지민에 의해 가려져있던 혜정의 매력을 마음껏 발산하는게 너무 좋아요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Como asi que no hemos llegado a 1M 🥺

STR3@M!!! Neverland no sean flojos (como siempre 😑) y empiecen con el STR3@M!!!...
=
혜정 음색 쓸쓸한 느낌이나서 좋다..민니의 독특하면서 귀에 착감기는 음색도 너무 좋네
=
I watched this because of Minnie OK!
=
04:02 어우~~~ 촥촥 감귀네~~~ 하면서 보다가 지호 표정이 너무 내 표정이라 개쪼갬 ㅋㅋ
=
FNC and CUBE need to stop being cowards and make Minnie & Hyejong a real duo unit.
=
Maybe not now, but I really hope one day minnie will release a solo album i mean with that voice ugh its a waste if she didnt
=
진짜 민니버전으로 음원하나 나와야함 ㄹㅇ제발........ 너무 좋아 민니ㅠㅠ
=
0:14 인트로만 몇번을 들었는지 모르겠네.... 요즘 아이들 언니들 너무 좋아유 ㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜ 음색 너무 좋음 진짜로 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 이 곡이랑 너무 잘 어울려 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Minnie and hyejeong perfect duo for me ♥️♥️♥️
=
NEVERLANDS!!! DON'T STOP STRE@MING!
=
00:43 민니 미소 심멎....
=
Yeah so this was just absurdly good. Perfect song choice to show off both vocalists, the song is technically intricate, and playing an instrument on stage deserves respect and will never not make me happy. I really hope this one wins. The other two were both very good, but this one is something special.
=
진짜 이거 미쳤다 레전드다 개쥬아
=
1:56 존나 웃김ㅌㄱㅌㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱㅋㄷㅌㄱㅌ
=
hi guys, GEUSS WHAT! 
MINNIE IS RLEASING A SONG WITH WENGIE AND ITS CALLED EMPIRE on the 18 of October 2019. 
PLEASE SHOW THEM LOVE AND SUPPORT 
thank youuuu.
=
이거도 계속 듣는데 안 질리네. 곡 후반부의 일렉기타 소리도 참 좋고. 3:53 장면도 참 멋있고.
=
1:37 누가언니였죠.....?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
민니 멋있어 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ심쿵
=
와 ... 혜정...... 진짜 노래 잘부른다
=
색다로운 화음이다 진짜 너무 좋아 이조합
=
Minne so amazing
=
Minnie..... ❤❤
=
복잡해 틈만 나면 바뀌는게 이부분 너무 음색이 미쳤다 ~~~~
=
아니 이팀이 당연 1등 아니냐고 ㅠㅜ 둘이 음색 너무 잘어울려어어
=
it’s so good 👍👍👍❤️
=
i love this duet !!! now i really need an AOA and Gidle´s collab
=
look different but not differnt
small and tall cute and sexy but this time Hyejeong look cool model more than sexy haha
but really good matching.
voice make song smooth. when they together look good.
=
둘다 찰떡이여서 더욱 아쉬움이 남는 무대인듯ㅜ 
민니가 완전 이 노래에 어울리면 혜정은 거기에 다른 색을 칠해주는거 같아서 진짜 색다르고 
혜정 목소리 좋은줄 몰랐다.... 개그캐인줄알았는데....
=
Absolutely BEAUTIFUL! ♡♡♡
=
솔직히 민니 팀에서 별로 존재감 없는 멤버라고 생각했는데 이번 무대 도입부 보고 완전 반해버렸다. 음색 느낌 모든게 너무 좋은 아이네 약간 어색한 발음마저 외국 가수의 내한공연 같은 느낌이다. 완전 반해버렸다!
=
They are both the tallest in the group
=
민니 표정이나 제스쳐가 너무 곡이랑 잘어울려..... 섹시하고 멋있고....
=
MINNIE SERIOUSLY NEEDS TO BLOW UP! I MEAN WOOOWW DAMN GURL CAN DO ANYTHING
=
You guys are so amazing
=
1:59 걸어올때부터 내 심장 조지고 부시는데 2:06 앵글 나가기 전에 씩 웃는거 미친다 진심 ,,
=
민니 음색 진짜 나라 구한 음색
=
민니 너무너무 좋아.. 목소리 제대로 처음 들어조는데 너무 좋아 ..ㅎ..ㅏ...
=
민니 파이어 무대 때 헤어스타일이랑 화장 너무 찰떡에다가 너무 예뻤는데 이번 무대에서도 진짜 너무 예쁘다 그리구 노래랑 목소리랑 너무 잘 맞아ㅠㅠㅜㅜ 곡 선정 잘한듯
=
인스타그램만 나오면 자막 없는거 왤케 웃기지 ㅋㅋ
=
와 둘이 잘 어울린다 ..
=
Come on guys we need 3k to surpass another group views,,, im sorry sunbaenim 🙏,  i love her so much
=
이게 왜 삼위..
=
This is the best performance yet the least viewed 😭 c'mon let's give them more love
=
도입부부터 민니 목소리는 그리움을 콕 자극하고 혜정이 목소리는 슬픔을 감싸줘서 눈물날 갓 같음 
둘이 호흡 미쳤네 보컬합 오졌다
=
민니 음색 진짜 미쳤다...
=
너무 좋다 최고다 💘
=
They did it well 😭
=
이번에 진짜 뮤지션 같았음 멋졌고 민니는 신인이 무슨 데뷔 7년차 같음
=
민니 미쳤다; 그렇게 큐티뽀짝했다가 갑자기 왜이렇게 힙하고 까리한거야 ㅠㅠ
=
Minnie has got a unique voice. I’m ready to listen to her solo songs all day!
=
어ㅏ 혜정이 목소리 사랑해 음색퀸
=
이거 진짜 개레전드였어
=
@2:56 - Nice subtle touch of putting 1023 (Minnie birthday) and 810 (Hyejeong birthday) in the background video
=
난 개인적으로 이 무대가 좋다 잔잔하니
=
my day is blessed thank you
=
내새끼 준내귀여워ㅠㅠㅠ
=
민니가 힙합 피처링하고 혜정이 솔로곡 내고 이러지말고 그냥 민니가 힙합하고 혜정이 피처링으로 같이 해주라ㅜ 둘 조합 짱이다 찢어지지말자ㅜ
=
크러쉬 노래가 발음이 어눌 ? 하다 해야되나 약간 그래서 민니한테 더 잘어울리는 듯 오히려 발음 정확한 혜정이 더 어색한 느낌
=
민니는 현재의 끝나지 못한 사랑을 노래하고 혜정은 빛바랜 옛사랑을 읊조리고 있는 것 같음
=
사연있는 목소리의 두 새럼 조합,, 진짜 둘이 다해먹었다,,,,
=
1:56 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㄱㄱ
=
They both have beautiful voices, but when they harmonized together ... it sent chills
=
솔직히 여기가 1등할듯
=
hyejeong’s voice is so attractive if that makes sense
=
Minnie I Love You❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
찬미가 혜정 혜정 거리는거 왤케 귀엽냐
=
너무좋아 이거..ㅠㅠ
=
와 민니 음색 너무 좋아 진심
=
민니 혜정도 좋고 다 좋은데 
갠적으로 민니 화사 같이 했으면 어떻게 됬을까...둘이 끈적한(?)느낌으로 노래를 부르니까...
=
I remember hyejeong the shy girl from romantic and idol, they should’ve let them collab on songs so hyejeong vocals would be showcased. All this time she was hidden..HOW?!
=
I liked this performance, the only thing that was a little off to me were their harmonies. They felt a little off the mark to me. Those harmonies could have been way tighter. I would have also been even more sold if that final run that Minnie did, was actually done in harmony with Hyejeong.
=
민니 혼자부르는 풀버전 보고싶다
=
hyejeong so good !
=
민니 음색 ㄷㄷ❤
=
민니랑 화사랑 콜라보했었으면.. 대박이였겠네.....❤
=
민니에게 스릉에 빠져버림 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ케
=
Minnie's voice is captivating😍
=
Perfect ♥.♥
=
민니가 진짜 잘하네
=
my ears? blessed.
=
왜꼴등이야 왜 너네가 꼴등이야 제일 잘했는데 응?
나좀 납득시켜줘 이거보다 얼마나 더 잘해야됌?
=
ㄹㅇ 아이들 다 무대랑 아래랑 갭차이 오지는듯..... 무슨 아래에서는 집에서 사랑받은 귀야미 막내 인데 무대만 서면 치명을 국이랑 밥말아먹는듯 존좋....
=
민니한테 찰떡이당.....
=
Kim Minnie 🤘💜
=
혜정 ❤️
=
혜정도 민니처럼 힙한 옷 입었어도 잘 어울렸을 것 같은데ㅠㅠ 그래도 뭔들 넘 멋지다
=
민니 최고야..............민니 음색 최고
=
I got goosebumps!!!
=
진짜 딴소린데 중간중간 미연 나올때마다 너무 이뻐서 헉 소리 나옴..... 지금까지 햇던 스타일링 중에 제일 이쁘고 제일 찰떡같아ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
이게 왜 3등인데!!!
=
그냥...민니가 민니했다
1등이야 이건..
=
민니 진짜 독보적 음색.. 미쳤다 아이들에서 소연이랑 수진이밖에 몰랐는데 민니 뭐야.. 예쁜데 노래도 잘해
=
악 민니야ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ나주거ㅠㅠㅠ ㅇ-|-< 혜정이랑 프로젝트 그룹해줘ㅠㅠ
=
米妮声音真的好听😍
=
SOMEBODY BETTER TAG DEAN THIS PERFORMANCE! THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL!
=
ELVIS here?
Hyejeong vocals made me blown away!!!
=
Wooooh. Both of their voice is so good y'all! Like wtf i kennnnat EVEN. Minnie's voice is jazzy while hyejoung's voice is sweet and innocent. Congrats to these two incredible girls!
=
Thank you for the 1m views 😚
=
에오에 골수팬인데 혜정진짜 움색 미쳤다구요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ이렇게 알린거 너무 죠타
=
와 민니 음색 이렇게 좋은지 첨 알았어요.. 민니 솔로버전 인스타그램 넘 듣고싶다ㅠㅠㅠ
=
우리 아기튀밥냥과 혜정리너스 음색깡패들이 모여서 진짜 죽을 거 같아요 그냥 무대를 뒤집어 놓으샸고 지구는 반으로 접어놓으셨답니다  저 지금 이것만 몇 번 듣는건지 그리고 둘이 화음 키차이 솔직히 그냥 모두 완벽하구요 저는 이 무대 아니 백 점 아니 천 점? 아니 만 점 드립니다 노래 너무 좋아요 진짜 갓 니차 욘 따라락 악 아악 갓 혜쩡 사랑합니다
=
민니 존나 예쁘다...아 저런 음색 존나 좋다 아이들 무대에선 수진이랑 소연만 보였었는데 이 프로그램으로 다시 보네...저 머리도 너무 잘 어울려
무대 옷이랑도 너무 힙하게 잘 어울린다...겁나 예쁜 타투 사장님 같애.. 한국말 할 때 그렇게 서툴더니 노래에선 걍 한국인....아 이건 주접 안 떨 수가 없다
=
민니 사랑햅...ㅠㅠ
=

민니는 자기전에 감성에 젖어 있는 것 같구 혜정은 다음 날 일어나서 후회한단거 완전 찰떡이얌😭😭
=
민니는 초반에 확! 끄는 느낌이고 혜정은 들을 수록 좋고 좋아지는 느낌이라 둘 다 너무 좋음 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
0:21 너도 ㅎㅎ
=
OMG THEY SLAYED
=
민니 언니ㅠㅠ
=

=
Hyejeong!!
=
1:59 ~ 2:09 민니 음색 얼굴 표정 제스쳐 노래 다 미쳤다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 너무 좋아..
=

=
민니 심각하게 예쁨...... 목소리도...
=
I am crying minnie you deserve the world 😭😭
=
It makes me want to rewatch Hye Jeong performances on King of Masked Singer. AOA is really lucky to have Yu Na and her because they can sing everything so well 🥴💓👼❤
This duo was awesome because it felt like a perfume with base, heart and top notes: 
Like a perfume you carry the song with you after you finish hearing it. 
You begin to shape your first impressions of the song with the big moments that are the solo parts. Those sound fresh, fruity  light and it burst in your ears.
Then once the top notes fade, the heart notes start to bloom. These are full-bodied notes and are the most dominant of the song. They are the duo parts. These notes form the core of the song. 
Last the song ends and the Base notes are what remain once the heart notes fade away. It is these notes that you remember most and which help create a memory in your mind. This is where the magic happens. Where the combination of Minnie, Hye Jeong and us forms something that will last long enough on our minds. These longest-lasting memories who boost the staying power of the top and heart notes. The moment you realize you fell in love with both the song and the singers. The moment you understand that it wasn't entertainment, it was communion. 💓
Ps: kudos if you read everything! 😁
=
아 혜정ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ ㅜㅠ
=
미쳤어 민니가 너무 독보적이라 혜정이 묻힐 것 같는 느낌 들었는데 세상에 혜정 가성 뭐야..소름돋았어 너무 잘하잖아,.?캬,,
=
민니 솔로곡 내면 대박일것같애 잠잘때 맨날 들으면서 잘듯
음색미쳐...!
=
와 진짜 민니 ..... 민니 진짜 음색 역대급 혜정이랑도 넘 잘어울림 하

=
민니 팬 되버렸음. 멋있져!
=
ㅁㅊ이거걍 민니노래인데??너무 찰떡이야,,,
=
퀸덤 여러무대 중에서 기억에 남는 무대들 많지만 , 뭔가 오후에 커피 마시면서 자꾸 이 무대가 보고싶어져요 ㅎㅎ 그냥 따뜻한 민니씨랑 혜정씨 음색이 위로가 되네요 ♡
=
민니는 그냥 팝스타인데?
=
I’m shocked that they didn’t win 🤨
=
민니는 목소리도 예쁜데 피아노도 잘 치네요 ㅠㅠ 부러워라
=
민니 목소리 사긴데?
=
00:44 미쳤다
=
개인적으로 제일 좋았당 ,,,,,,,,ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
AAAAAA MINNIE YR VOICE IS GODDESSSSS. ANDAND OMG FINALLY THEY LET HYEJEONG SHINE. Since her debut i have been WAITING for her to showcase her vocals because before her debut i rmb she actually has a really sweet voice🙈❤️ like she sang q a lot but idk why after tht she didn’t get to show it as much. AAAAA FINALLY I AM SO SMITTEN BY HYEJEONG’S VOCALS. AOA needs a ballad comeback or some shit. Anws ugh can they pls be a duo and come up w a smol album. The world needs to be blessed by both their vocals TGT. And ugh minnie’s and hyjeong’s voices really suit indie songs. What a great show.
=
MY LOVES💜💜💜❤😭❤😭
=
와 인스타그램 노래 민니 음색이랑 개찰떡이다
=
Hyejeong 👍👍 voice and Minnie voice daebakkkk
=
옷 개까리 진짜 미쳤다 진짜 감성 이렇게 다르게 잘어울리기 힘든데
=
Love it!!
=
아니 ㅠㅠㅠ  민니 ㅠㅠㅠ 진짜  ㅠㅠㅠ ❤❤❤ 미쳤어
=
민니 뭐임 왜이리 잘해;;;
=
내 마음속에 1등 💕💕💕
=
Their voices fit so well and their harmonies are out of this world
=
데뷔 초부터 민니 음색 특이하고 매력적이라 생각했는데 역시 너무 조아👍
=
MINNIE AND DEAN MUST COLLAB!!!!
=
Minnie’s voice is so damn good
=
3:28 민니가 자랑스러운 리더님과 우기
=
minnie 😍 hyejeong😍
=
Best duo,,, 👍👍
=
3:05 졸귀
=
음색 미쳤다!!
=
혜정이 목소리 이쁘네
=
1:29
이거 혜정이 실수한거여?
아님 자막이 오타인거여?
=
언닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ민닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ왜그래요 갑자기ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Hyejong💜
=
혜정 담백한 목소리 넘좋다..  이렇게 예쁜줄도 퀸덤보고 알았네  그동안 넘 묻혀있었던듯
=
I enjoyed Hwasa/Kei's performance as much as this one, but for some reason, I really want this one to win? Perhaps it is because both Minnie and Hyejeong are underrated as vocalists.
=
Minnie’s smile at the end is everything
=
Amazing !!!!! Love from Nashville,TN. USA
=
My god!!! Minnie she is Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!
=
OMG Minnie can play the piano and she sings so goood! Her voice is soothing and can give u goosebumps
=
혜정 원래 이렇게 노래 잘했나;; 민니 음색에 안묻히고 잘하네.!
=
민니 첫소절에서 끝났다 진짜로
=
우잉 ㅠㅠㅠ 우기 소연이가 민니 자랑스럽다고 하는 거 넘 예뻐 ㅠㅠㅠ 사랑해 난 너네가 자랑스러워 엉엉 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
민니 귀여워
=
둘 다 너무 잘했다..간만에 예술에 취해본다.
=
Minnie's voice is so calming and unique. I love her 😭
=
혜정 누나 멋있다!!! 목소리 꿀 같다 진짜
=
민니가 복잡해~ 할때 너무 멋있고 발음 음색이 귀에 맴돈다
=
편곡 돈스파이크...?
=
민니 음색ㄹㅇ;;
=
김민니 목소리 진짜 국보급이다 나중에 asmr 하면 진짜 팅글 쩔거같다
=
미줔ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ민니가아니라 언니랰ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
WOOOOOW😍🤩!
=
둘다 찰떡이네 선곡 개잘했다 음색엄청 돋보여
=
이 게전드가 3위라니 말이되오
=
Minnie's voice is so beautiful. I wish she shows this side of her voice more in gidle
=
No one picked them because they were ment to be a duet
=
Hyejeong is an amazing idol, beautiful, sexy, funny, laughs all the time and great voice.
=
슈화가 이거 보고 빠질만 했어
=
민니 걍 도입부 부터 걍 지려벌임
=
Best performance imo, no hate to the other units. Minnie or Hyejeong didn't outshine each other which i felt was what happened in the other vocal units.
=
화사랑 민니도 잘어울릴듯 ㅠㅠ
=
민니네 사장님 민니 솔로곡 하나만 내줘요~~~
=
3:01 키스해 키스해
=
Jessi, Jimin Park and any member of EXID would have also been great in this show, ahhhhhh






scratch that, I hope all strong women in the industry gets showcased in queendom.
=
음색 살려서 담백하게 부르는 거 너무 좋다 기술적으론 보여주기 힘든 곡이라도 이런 곡이 진짜 한 번만 듣기 힘든 곡... 둘 다 너무 잘해줘서 고마워 진짜 최고야
=
와~민니야. 대박이다
=
Omg how tall is hyejeong 😂 i feel weak
=
민니 얼굴 재질 걍 미쳤음
=
I really need them to release the studio version of this pleasee🙏 

aside from how well they sang this song that I love and got the right vibe, I also really liked the set design and led display they used for this performance (idk who's in charge of this but it was defs to best of the 3 for me)
=
개좋다 미쳤어...개인적으로 원곡보다 더 좋다 어케 이 노래를 음색이랑 팀호흡으로 성공시키냐 진짜 능력자들
=
조명이 노란색이라 그런가 왜 중간 중간에 화사님 나올때마다 나혼자산다같지 ㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱㄱ
=
Imagine them performing dean- sometimes I hear howling in my head😭💙🖤
=
둘 다 최고,,
=
잘하네 혜정 보러 계속 들어옴 😘
=
Hyejeong so beautiful and mature omg
=
they didn’t deserve 3rd. they deserved to win.
=
세 팀 다 잘아지만 이 팀을 젤 좋아해요. 1등 할 수 있다고 생각했는데...... 아쉽다
=
민니 혼자 완곡하는거 듣고싶다 너무 몽환적 ,,,,
=
민니 솔로 플리즈....음색 미친...
=
민니 음색 실화맞아? 너 무 예 뻐
해서 옷+행동도 멋있어요
혜정 목소리도 너무좋아요

아 다시 이노래에 빠지고있다 💜
=
민니♡♡
=
Still can’t believe they got 3rd🤨
=
혜정님 목소리 저리 예쁜걸 왜 이제야 안거지 ㅜㅠㅠ 잘부르는건 원래 알았지만 ㅜㅠㅠ 목소리 너무 예쁘쟈냐 ㅜㅠ
=
Me encanto :)
=
혜정은 확실히 무대체질이다
=
What a good combination of vocals 😱😱😱
=
민니 음색 너무 사기다... 아이들은 진짜 다 사기캐만 모아놨네 ㅠㅠ
=
มินนี่🙆‍♀️해정🙆‍♀️🥰♥️💋😘
=
How can this stage got the last place??
=
둘이 우승해!!
=
Minnie was so adamant against doing a ballad and she still ended up doing one... Maybe the results would have been better if she'd pushed for a slightly more upbeat, popular song like Hwasa did.
=
All these comments about Minnie, but Hyejeong's soulful, sultry vocals are to be appreciated
=
아 혜정 음색 존나 발린다 언니 사랑해
=
2:30 
2:30
이 부분부터 화음 넣어서 같이 부르는거 최고야..
=
is this on Spotify??? BCOS I NEED THIS 😍😍
=
난 이 곡이 제일 좋다 ~.~
=
민니 보니까 딘이랑 느낌 분위기 음색 비슷한 걸 알았음 와... 힙한데 몽환스러워
=
Voices like Minnie and Lim Kim are so unique and rare tbh
=
เพราะมากควัฟฟ🙆‍♀️💞
=
엠넷프로중에 퀸덤이 그래도 젤 맘에드네 이득보는게 많은거같음
=
돌림노래 기대했는데 아쉽
그래도 너뮤 잘한다 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
퀸덤 보고 하나 건진 게 있다면 민니를 알게 된 거다 아 물론 마마무도사랑해
=
민니 음색 미쳐따..,,..
=
My favorite performance
=
lets go 1m!!
=
민니 매력덩어리네..
팬도 아닌데 저번주에 보고 너무 귀여웠는데
이젠 또 너무 멋있음 ..
=
이번편 혜정언니 왜케 이뻐 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Minie the talented girl
=
yall minnie's voice is sweet as honey
=
My 2 pretty bias 😍😘♥️
=
민니는 스타일링 따라서 진짜 다채롭다...
음색이 은하수 속을 걷는것 같어..
=
진짜 다 실력파들이다. 민니는 특히 너무 좋다
=
2:40 너무 예쁘고 너무 잘하고 지금 난리가 났네 그냥 혜정!
=
이 프로그램은 걸그룹들 각자매력도 보여주고 눈호강 귀힐링까지시켜주니 너무좋다
=
혜정!!😍😍😍😍😍
=
Their harmonies were the best. I have no idea who's going to win but I wouldn't be surprised if they do
=
Minnie. ❤️
=
minnieeeeee 💕
=
I WANT DEAN TO NOTICE THIS
=
민니 사랑해
=
Who love minnie and hyejeong before and after watching queendom?
=
와 민니 음색이랑 노래랑 너무잘어울리고 미쳤다진짜 풀로 커버해서 유튭올려주세요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 너무 쩔어서 한 다섯번정도보고 그러고보니 한국인이었나..? 아 맞다 외국인이지 싶었다 발음도 완전 정확하고 이 무대보고 완전 발려버림 사랑해요언니ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
발음진짜좋다 발음이좋으니깐 듣기도좋고 음색조차 좋으니깐 완벽하네
=
3:13~ 혜정 딘닮은듯?!!
=
음원 정식 출시 안하나요? ㅠㅠ 가장 듀엣 같았는데..
=
How nice! 🥰❤
=
그 와중에 면 언니 예쁜거 보소
=
민니 개멋있어,,
=
민니 음색 울림이 있는듯...오래되고 어두운 공터에 빛 한줄기 타고 먼지들이 공중에서 반짝거리는걸 보며 나지막이 노래 부르는 느낌..
=
OMG😮so good♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
=
Minnie💜
=
ชอบเพลงนี้อยู่แล้ว มินนี่ร้องดีอีก
=
민니 혜정 짱 먹어라😍👍
=
i wish minnie's voice is a place.. so i can stay there forever..
=
코디님 사랑합니다♡♡
=
my eyes always see Hyejeong AOA
=
Where Seolhyun, I only see 3 members in AOA room and 1 member in stage
=
민니 음색이 이렇게 좋았다고??? 대박이다!
=
민니 영상 찾아보면 정말 음색이 넘 좋은거 같다,,분위기까지 치명적 소름 돋았다 퀸덤에 민니 독무 나왔음 좋겠다(바램)
=
파트너 선정할 때 민니 계속 다음방 다음방 가고ㅋㅋ 혜정장군 에어컨도 안들어오는 방에서 혼자 외로이 기다렸던 게 웃기면서도 짠했는데 보컬팀은 이 팀이 보컬간 합이 제일 좋았던듯
이 노래가 민니 혜정 목소리에 너무 잘 어울려ㅠㅠ 민니 외국인 맞나 딕션 감정 다 오지는데ㅋㅋ 혜정이는 보컬 저리 매력있는지 몰랐고 요즘 같은 날씨에 자꾸만 생각나는 단짠그룹♥
=
내맘속 1등이야..
=
혜정 음색 완전 따뜻하고 좋다...
=
민니 당신은 아이돌 아니야 가수야 아티스트야
=
95 aas great but for me Ah-Ah won my heart. Aoa girls wins my heart in Queendom. How are they still so strong despite terrible management and with so much will to continue as 5. I wasn’t a fan, after choa left I pretty much didn’t pay attention until Bingle Bangle.
=
Omg I love DEAN. AOA and MINNIE really did DEAN JUSTICE
=
민니 언니 나 언니한테 진심이야!!!!!!!!!!!
=
민니 솔로곡 내주세요..
=
미쳤다..ㅠ
이것도 음원 나오는거죠?ㅠㅠ
=
민니 목소리.. 약간 허스키하면서 청아하고 맑은 느낌 ㅜㅜ 구슬픔
=
와 진짜 목소리 케미 개쩐다
=
아악 민니 음색을 드디어 보여주다니잇
=
빙충이 큐브놈들아 김민니 목소리 그냥 두지 마
=
이 노래 전에 민니가 얘기했던것처럼 돌림노래 했어도 완전 좋았을것같은데 안해서 넘 아쉽당.... 내머리속에서 민니가 자꾸  문제야 문제~ (문제야 문제~) 하고 돌림노래 불러서 미치겠음.....김민니 내머릿속에서 나오라고 ㅠㅠ
=
OMG!!! Minnie❤️
=
好想知惠晶的衣服在哪裏買
=
I love Minnie. I never stanned a Thai Member like I stan her.
=
❤❤❤❤
=
민니야
=
너무 잘한다ㅜ
=
민니 응원해
=
This show just made AOA 'redebut' in a good way. Let's make their second prime, or even the third.
=
진짜 음색들이 모두 노래에 찰떡이어서 좋아요💜
=
제 생일에 올리셧네용 운명인ㄱ..)퍽퍼억..!)큼..죄송합ㄴ대 노래 진짜 좋고 아아 화이팅!!
=
민니 자우림 노래 잘 어울릴것 같아요. 뭔가 몽환적이고 독특함.
=
Solar looks shooketh
=
혜정 다시봤다 .. 호감가는 얼굴..!! 민니 음색은 진짜 좋아
=
민니음색와우......
퀸덤을계기로아이들과오마이걸에대해서알아가는느낌이에요!
=
이게 전설의 수진이 한정 치대는 슈화가 민니한테 반한 무대....
=
Mygod....if they dont win idk what to do with myself......
=
This is lovely😍😍😍😍 💞💞💞💞💞
=
이 팀 1등할 것 같다 본인들 음색이랑 맞게 선곡도 너무 잘 잡았고 둘 합이 너무 잘맞음
=
이무대가 왜 3등인지 납득안가는 1인
=
오타아아아
나의 밤속에~~~
=
Uhm can I have Minnie's voice please?
=
민니 연습 무지 했는지. 아이들 노래 따라 할 때, 혜정 파트 따라 하네.@_@
=
진짜 민니 아니고 언니야아아아
=
MINNIE♥
=
so what we've learned today is that Minnie needs to go solo
=
좋긴한데 편곡이 뭔가 아쉬운듯..ㅠㅠ 차라리 민니가 1절 거의 다부르고 그담에 혜정이 하는게 나았을꺼같은데..😢
=
한국인들 취향엔 일단 질러줘야 무조건 먹어주는데
이곡을 했다는건 대단한 모험인듯
=
Hyejeong😭😍💛💛💛💛
=
민니 솔로곡 나오면좋겠다
=
무대 안 끊고 보고싶은데 리액션 때매 끊겨서 아쉽..ㅜㅜ
=
Minnie i love u and ure voice girl
=
aoa는 지민 설현 찬미 초아 정도로만 알고 있던 그룹이었는데 이번에 퀸덤 통해서 aoa를 더 잘 알게된것같아서 기분 너무좋아요 ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ이런 보석같은 언니들이 있었다니 진짜 사랑해요언ㄴ니들
=
Minnies is going to be a powerful vocalist 😍
=
Cheer up!!!!!! Such a butterfly in my ear   Great great voice
=
잘했는데 무대뒤 비디오때문에ㅜ너무 눈아픔
=
Yuqi is proud for minnie
=
Their vocal is literally out of this world, Minnie’s breathy voice gave me goosebumps
=
이무대는 내마음에 1등이야
=
Solar at 3:45 🤣🤣. She is a MOOD.
=
민니 발음이 더 어눌했다면 뭔가 분위기가 안 났을 거 같은데 발음이 좋아서 분위기가 더 업된 듯 그리고 자칫 어눌해질 수 있는 단어가 민니 목소리로 커버됨... 뜬금없지만... 목소리부터 타고낫는데...얼굴은 더 타고남 민니 아니고 언니 사랑해
=
민니는 왠지 헤어지고 다음날 아침에 후회하는 느낌이고 혜정은 자기전에 혼잣말하는 느낌이라서 진짜 듣기너무 좋다ㅠㅠ 녹음해서 전화벨하라감...
=
MINNIE COLLAB WITH BOLBBALGAN4 SKWJSKSNKWJS
=
혜정 목소리 왜케이쁘냐... 넘 여자여자하니 내스탈 ㅜㅜ
=
4:02 누구에요???
=
한국어 댓글 왜이렇게 안보이지?
=
민니 비긴어게인 나와서 instagram처럼 알앤비/인디 위주의 노래나 팝송 불러줬으면 좋겠다
=
minnie 😍
=
우기 자랑스럽다는 말 무슨 소린지 알거같음ㅜ민니 음색개오짐
=
i hope minnie will get a lot of featuring call after this performance..
with that kind of voice,,
=
elvis and neverland here


and just to make sure no more b*tches who dared to come to AOA's vocal and calling them talentless and flopped sl*ts without choa.. esp those people who calling her bad singer when she performed at KOMS

Knetz work hard in hating AOA but AOA work harder to proves those people wrong and they did.. theu overcome the gap that choa left
=
Sorry that you didn't win 😭
=
혜정이가 탈탈 털렸다...민니가 너무 잘부른다+_+;;
=
민니는 그냥 태국에서 연예인했어도 됐을거 같은데
먼곳까지 왔네
=
Minnie baby.💙
=
민니 진짜 솔로앨범 내주면안되나 알앤비 슬픈걸로 지르는거 들으면 벌써 벅차오르고 눈물날것같음
=
I like minnie 😍😍😍
=
혜정리너스 뭔데여 노래 개잘해... 괜히 여태 살아남은 그룹 멤버가 아니었어
=
음색에 치이고 설레는 키차이에 또 치이고 빠져버렸다
=
민니 눈웃음 너무 설레
=
Minnie’s voice is really out of the world. She has actually very good vocal techniques and her vocal tone is so unique and pretty.
=
Shuhua ah 🤣🤣🤣🤣 calm down baby
=
이번 경언하면서 정말 느낀건데 우리나라 아이돌들 판깔아주니까 날라다니네..
=
민니!!!!!!!! 혜정!!!!!! 사랑해!!!!!!
=
혜정 노래듣고 소름돋음..👍👍
=
Hyejeong and Minnie's vocals are smooth like velvet their harmonization is so amazing
=
Hyejeong 😍😍😍
=
민니 님 음색 공허하면서 몽환적이여서 잘 어울리시고 혜정 님도 감정 잘 담아내신 거 같아서 좋다 특히 두분 같이 부르는거 잘 맞아서 넘 좋았어
=
민니 음색하나로 씹어먹었누...
=
민니야.....무대 위에서 정말 빛나는구나
=
I kinda want Hyejeong to show her powerful voice like the one she shows in Mask Singer, she and Minnie did AWESOME regardless. I hope they rank #1
=
Loved hye jeong voice
=
Minnie way of singing somehiw remind me of aimer.
=
Minnie 😍
=
이건 뭐랄까 따른데 처럼 이렇다할 임팩트가 없었다해야될까.....너무 잘했는데 따른 팀들이 너무 잘했다....아쉽다
=
아 미쳤다 와 진짜 얘네가 무조건 1등 아님??ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ민니 혜정 음색 진짜 잘어울림ㅠㅠㅠ
=
รู้สึกภูมิใจในตัวมินนี่จัง ฮืออออออ มินนี่ <3
=
see park bom say minnie can sing ballad i know she can 🥰
=
their voice suit each other
=
민니 음색 처음드는데 대박
저거본후 바로 인스타그램노래다운받음 ㅜ 민니가 처음부터 끝까지부른 인스타그램 ㅜㅜ 소장하고파!!!!!!!!!
=
dean ✨✨✨✨✨
=
민니 화사 조합 제발  한번만요
=
I know AOA bcoz of this show
=
민니목소리 짱좋다..이노래랑 너무잘어울려...
=
AOA never had the chance to show off their true and raw vocals before, this makes me so happy, look at the talent
=
민니 음색에 묻힐수도 있었을 것 같은데 혜정 나름대로 존재감 살리면서 서포트도 너무 잘한다.... 진짜 깔끔하당ㅜㅜ
=
Minnie's style reminds me of Tessa Thompson. I will like to hear her covering Time tick or grip
=
알고보니 아녜진의 큰그림
=
Seriously no recording version of this cover?? Haizzz
=
예뻐
=
Go views .keep streaming
=
민니음색이조짐
=
❤️❤️
=
음원졈내줘영~~~!!!!
=
Minnie enjoying herself
=
이게 뭐여 ..
=
1:13
=
나는 혜정같은 맑은음색좋아ㅜㅜ
제일좋아❤❤❤❤❤
=
근데 인스타가 돼요 방송에? 저번 쇼미8에서는 기리보이 오빠 파트 편집됐는데..
진짜 궁금해서 물었어요😁
=
This team definitely was the best at picking a song that fits both their voices soooo good. AND THEIR HARMONY??? wow. 
I really hope they win, especially because they’re both singers who never got to showcase the true color of their voice in group songs and now that they did THEY ROCKED IT!! So proud and happy for both <3
=
Gidle and AOA teaming up solved my bias issue.
=
Im so melting for both of them
=
이게 왜 3위인지 도통 알 수가 없다,, 당신들,,, 내 마음 속 0위야,,
=
❤
=
민니랑 화사랑 무대하는거 한번 보고싶네요
=
น้องมินนี่เก่งมากๆค่ะ ชอบเสียงของหนูมากๆเลย
=
혜정 목소리 넘모 깨끗해
=
They harmonize really well
=
혜정♡♡♡
=
음원 주세요유ㅠ.ㅠ
=
무대가 말도 안돼ㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 너무 좋다ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 혜정이가 딱 받쳐주고 민니 음색 먹어주고 하니까 그냥 끝나버림 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I'm in love with this duo
=
And these are the two no one wanted to work with?
=
박봄♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
Arin is so beautiful 😳
=
옛날 테일러스위프트 초창기에 음색듣고 "와 씨 이거머지?? 내 귓구멍 녹아내리겠네"하고 빠져들었고 그다음 빌리아일리시 음색보고 "와 씨 이건 또 머지? ㅈㄴ괴물이네"하고 또 빠져들었고 그 다음은 민니 음색에 "와 이런 미친...세상에..."하고 또 빠져들었네
난 음색빠.....ㅠㅜ
=
check out empire mv guys..for our minnie
=
I'm surprised that they got the least views in youtube since they did the best for me. They deserve more recognitions
=
해시태그에 AOA는 있는데 왜 (여자)아이들은 없지?
=
와 둘다 정말멋지고 나중에 화사민니조합보고싶다
=
This felt waaay too short
=
I like this cover 🥰😍🎶🤩
=
❤️
=
민니는 팝 가수 같고 혜정이는 한국 정통 발러더 같네...세상에 그냥 둘이 다해먹어...제바 ㄹ 이 조합으로 정식으로 유닛데뷔 안 하나요..?ㅠㅠ
=
OKAY LETS TALK ABOUT HYEJEONG'S VOCAL OH MY GAWD ELVIS ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE HER
=
혜정이넘나져아
=
Imagine a Minnie + DO collab
=
1:56
=
I love em both!
=
설레는키차이
=
몸매 평가 말고 그냥 노래 잘한다고 하고 좀 지나가라
=
🥺❤️
=
Ok now put minnie with hwasa... someone tell her to perform I wish you were gay....😀
=
음원 내놓으세요 암넷ㅡㅡ
=
민니 최고임
=
선곡이 살렸다
=
This is the one! They really perform as a duet, as a group, but not 2 different people come for 1 performance. #duet #아아 #hyejeong #minnie #aoa #gidle
=
I didn't like the song that much, but their voices blend so well. Minnie's voice is honestly so unique and she is personally one of my favorite vocalists in kpop. And Hyejeong tho!!! I knew she was good so I'm really glad that she's able to showcase her amazing vocals here.
=
Why did Korea get good diamonds from Thailand?
=
Minnie👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
=
음원 안 나오나요?
=
Nicha why so beautiful?
=
Never underestimate the underdogs! Minnie and Hyejeong makes a great performance together :)
=
I love how minnie say 핸드phone instead of 핸드폰 so cool.
I'm curious about minnie's korean pronounciation, I've heard that she sounds very native. Can korean people here tell me about minnie pronouncition?
=
โอ้ย พี่มินนี่เสียงเพราะม๊ากกกกก!!!!
=
민니 음색 미친 거 아니냐 ㅠ
=
😭🙏💘
=
I didn't know that hyejeong was this good...oh my gosh ...
=
Neverlands get ready 👑🔊Cube Ent confirms collaboration between Minnie of and popular Australian influencer & YouTuber called wengie .The single ‘EMPIRE’ will be released Friday October 18th at 4pm KST.
=
It did still not have a high note to highlight their performance, it would be perfect if they had it
=
뭔가 노래 처음 듣는건데(워낙 그런데에 관심이 없어서 걍 지나가다가 얼핏들은 정도?)  민니님은 밤에 술에 취하거나 잠에취해서 부르는 느낌이고 혜정님은 황혼을 보거나 아침에 해뜰때 부르는 느낌이 드는것같애요
=
혜정 시작하는데 소름 쫙 돋네 ,,
=
Even though I think Minnie would kill singing "wish you were gay" she did such an amazing job with Hyeojong.
=
the first one who sang reminded me a bit of aimers voice
=
Me encanta mucho esta presentación para mí es la mejor ❤️✨
=
원곡이 1도 생각안남
=
민니는 역시 음색 미쳤고 노래랑 완전 찰떡인데 세상 힙하기까지...♡
우리 혜정장군은 노래 선곡 민니한테 맞춰줬는데도 잘 소화했고 애절한 발라드곡이나 ost 담담하게 불러도 잘 어울릴 듯👍 
아아 3위인거 넘 아쉽고ㅠㅠ 내 마음속 1위야 진짜 순위에 연연하지 않았음 좋겠고 이 기회에 둘다 솔로곡 발표해주길❤
=
i'm filled with pride of my girl Minnie, she is my everything
=
Queens .
=
Their voices are so great themselves and even better together. The voice tone and colors are both so special, soulful and compliment each other so well. This performance really deserved a better rank.
=
minnieeeeee the best😭❤️
=
4:13 OMG HER VOICE IS SO SOFT   I'M SPEECHLESS
=
민니 첫소절부터 그냥 게임끝 다 발렸다 진짜
=
민니 더 듣고 싶은 목소리
=
Never liked the song but this duo made me like it for once <3
=
민니입덕
=
Minnie's voice is no doubt more diverse, but I really liked Hyejeong's voice with this song.
=
난 혜정이 더 끌린다...
=
4:02 혹시 이 금발머리분 누군지 아는사람
=
💕💕💕
=
민니는 관중을 사로잡고 무대를 이끌어 가는 게 프로의 느낌이 날 정도 음색은 두번 말해 머해 목소리 속에 울림과 깊이까지
=
아니 이게 신인 실력이냐,, 진짜 우리 언니들 미친것같음.. 그리고 혜정님 너무 멋있으세요!! 감정표현 진짜 잘하시는듯 ㅎㅎ
=
NEVIS HERE (neverland + elvis)
=
What place did this performance get? It's incredible!
=
혜정이 못 했다는 건 아닌데 독특한 음색인 민니와 화사가 함께 꾸미는 인스타그램 무대는 어땠을지 궁금함
=
Now I'll wait the studio ver.
=
민니가 아니라 언니 올해의 띵언이네요. 전 혜정에게 애정이 가네요 사랑해요 언니
=
I'm truly madly deeply fall in love.
=
혜정♡민니 너무예쁘고 너무잘하고 지금 ~~~~~! 
이무대가 일등할듯
=
Hyejeong got me eargasm. I love her. She is sexually attractive person. Even she only stood there, but i feel the hotness inside her. And those vocal, she might haven't show her best yet, but damn god ... You could easily pull a man into yout bedroom with that voice. Too sensual.
=
I’m so happy that Minnie gain popularity now; hope that she will be very powerful in industry
=
민니....목소리 녹네 녹아
첫소절에서 긴장한 듯 떨리는 목소리가 킬포임
=
มินนี่โครตเท่💚
=
I can't believe they're this good T_T
=
Minnie so charming and hyejong too , now i can understand why park hyunsik stand her
=
이번 보컬은 민니를 가진 게 한 수
=
I love how hyejeong sound so jazzy sexy and Minnie sound more jazzy hip, they sound so gooood together 😭🤧
=
😍
=
Everyone listen this song at night and remind of our memories, maybe a cup of tea or coffee, and rookies. That a nice night!

Minnie has this heavenly voice and i am so glad she was able to showcase that !! As for Hyejeong she is the sunbae so you can hear the experience in her voice and they suited each other so well ! Literally a matchmade in heaven!!
=
looooppppppppppppppppppppppppp~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``
=
아니.... 퀸덤 노래 다 미쳐써...하나같이 다 명곡이다
=
My love minniee
=
MINNIEEEEE MINNIEEEEE
=
민니가 아니고 언니래ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㄱㅋㄲㅋㅋㅋ
=
Minnie's dreamy voice is too top-notch.
=
“Shes not Minnie she UNNIE”😭
=
민니는 진짜 한국에선 나올수 없는 음색인듯,, 아이들 입덕이요
=
Let's talk about Hyejeong too. Hyejeong killed this performance as well.
=
Masterpiece, hyejong did great :) minnie so talented tooo!!!! Love u
=
they did really god job here, but hyejong voice is hands down smoother in here
=
Hyejeong was really good so stable and confident i love that 💖
=
I love their tandem so much , so suit to each other. 😍
=
Soyeon was right , minnie has unique sounds. Kudos to hyejong so sultry voice , they are fit to jazz .
=
Keep stre*ming neverlands
=
I can't get over Minnie's vocal color. 

Soyeon wasn't joking when she said she's never heard a vocal color like Minnie's before.
=
TEAM AA WINS!!!
=
She's not Minnie, She's Unnie!! Hahaha love it!
=
Their performance deserves more views !!!
=
Hyejeong do a really great job I love her voice😍
=
Woah..Minnie's voice is something so addicting like...hey she's so great and talented. Same with Hyejeong, her voice is also amazing. I love how they harmonize and how they fit perfectly as a unit. Their performance is so damn great♡
=
HYEJEONG !
=
This was the best episode for me so far. It's full of great performances. The collaborations worked out despite the confusion as to who went with who in the vocal side. The dance group individual performances was as great as the group's synergy. Minnie and Hyejeong's voices I never thought would blend well together but they did great here.
=
0:44 대박 예뻐 언니 사랑해
=
민니 솔로 싱글한곡 준비하자 큐브ㅠㅠㅠㅠ

3:57...민니 허밍 부분 작살난다 크으
=
Shine Minnie!!! ✨✨✨✨
=
Unique voiceeees! Charming performance ♥♥♥
=
진짜 다른 무대도 진짜 멋지고 잘했는데 혜정이랑 민니는 자기들 노래 부르는거 같고 너무 목소리 잘어울린다
=
Omg I love how they switched between the high and low pitched harmony @2:14! This is too good!
=
민니 목소리 진짜 미친듯 너무 좋음
=
음색이 달라서 더 잘어울린다... 진짜 소름..
=
STRE@M MORE!!!
=
민니신인맞냐ㅜㅜㅜ진짜쩔어ㅜㅜㅜ너무좋아음색ㅜㅜ미침
=
Love them❤️❤️ I wish they got the first place.
=
민니 음색 너무조아ㅠㅠ
=
혜정 목소리 개좋다ㅠㅜ
=
보컬도 너무 최고지만 래퍼끼리 뭉치는 것도 보고싶음 ㅠㅠ 소연 지민 미미 문별...
=
둘이 목소리 너무 잘 어울린다...😍 원래 각자 음색도 좋은 데 합쳐지니까 크으으....👍2:14 ~
=
2:03 she looks like Yuri
=
와 민니 에반데 진짜 개쩐다...
=
When ur bias has a duet💀
=
아이들 실력자가 왜케많음???
=
Minnieeeeeee❤️❤️
=
혜정 퀸덤에서 장군님 개그캐라서 가만히 있는데도 넘 귀엽고 웃기다❤❤
뭔가 웃겨줄거같은 기대감 생겨부림
뚜루뚜뚜 하는 것도 넘 정직해서 귀여워!!
=
밑에 그런 댓글있었는데
혜정이는 이별한 사람같고 민니는 이별한 혜정이를 위로해주는 사람같다고....
진짜 쌉ㅇㅈ이다...
=
아니...민니...머리부터 발끝까지 목소리 포함해서 힙함....사랑해...민니........ㅠ
=
민니 음색 개좋아푸ㅠㅜㅠ

=
대박 어떡해 언니들 너무 예뻐 민니언니 사랑해
=
THE BEST VOCAL PERFORMANCE ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
Hye jeong killed it...plus so beautiful
=
혜정 부분 너무좋다.. 뭔가 가사에 진정성이 느껴지게 들림.. 음원 같이도 내주고 따로도 내줬으면.. 3번 다 듣게 ㅠㅠ
=
아 진짜 화음 진짜 나 운다 사랑해
=
Minnie POWERFUL vocal
=
ㅎㅖ정 뒤에 화면같은거 세워놓은거도 넘 맘에들고 둘다 코디도 쩔고 노래는 말할것도 없고 진짜 대박 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 목소리 떨리는것까지 생생하게 들려서 더 멋졌던거같음.... 혜정님 혼자 노래하는건 첨 들어보는데 에오에 보면볼수록 이렇게 좋은 보컬들이 많다는걸 느끼는 것 같음.... 민니님은 원래 음색 개쩌는건 알고 있었는데 혼자 부른건 거의 팝송만 듣다가 이런 한국노래도 잘어울린다는걸 알게됐음... 아무튼 듀엣무대는 한명이 없으면 안될것 같다라는 생각이 들어야 한다고 생각하는데 그런 느낌이 들었음
=
민니 음색 미쳤누
=
혜정 개이쁘다 ㄹㅇ
=
How is this the less viewed of the three performances? they are amazing
=
Minnie can you be anymore talented????
=
약간 민니님은 바쁜 일상에서 지친 커리우먼이
인스타그램 들어갔다가 다들 즐겁게 사는데 나만 이런가 하는 느낌이고 혜정님은 남친이랑 헤어진지 얼마 안 된 여자가 럽스타그램 보고 공허함을 느끼는 거 같은 느낌... 그런 두 여자가 만나서 서로 아무말 없이 같이 있어주는 그런 하 좋다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ민니님 멋있구 혜정님은 뭔가 묘하게 섹시하시구 최고시다ㅠㅠ
=
i love minnie so much 
greeting from ph neverland and blink saranghae
=
왜 아무도 마지막에 민니 활짝 애긔애긔하게 웃으면서 혜정이랑 같이 팬들향해서 손 흔드는건 언급 안함 ㅠㅠㅠ 개귀여워 진쨔 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=

=
Good song ever 😊👏
=
민니목소리메컵👍
=
다 좋았지만 세 팀 중에 팀원끼리 목소리 제일 잘 어울리는 팀 여기 아닐까...
=
I wish their companies let them sing more naturally like this, I didnt know how great hyejeong voice is, all her lines in AOA are so high pitched we never get to hear her low more soul voice, and sure it the same for Minnie? i really hope these 2 win !!!
=
Imagine being in that crowd. Their voice harmonized so well and the stage is simply yet so beautiful. That would be so amazing 😮
=
i like their voices and hyejeong’s voice killed it!!
=
hyejeong’s voice is so angelic (love)
=
I started liking this song because of them 😂 They were the best in the Vocal Unit. Their voice blended so well, especially with the harmonization. Just perfect. I hope they win ✊
=
That Minnie girl is good.  It's not easy to nail this lazy song. You need to be absolutely relaxed to get the vibe of the song.
=
They blessed my ears 💜❤
Fighting Minnie we are so proud of you😭💕
=
Hyejeong's voice sounds so pureeeeee ghaddd love itttt
=
what is aoa’s agencies i wish they can make a cb soon...
=
*They sound amazing together and there vocals are just 👌💯*
=
another day another queendom stage to give me gay heart palpitations oh my go ood
=
I've always seen dean in minnie since the release of uh-oh. And now she's showing her true colours! I hope she will cover this song and make a video of it.
=
it touchs my heart, even thought i don't understand the lyrics. 🤩
=
Minnieeeeee I'm so proud of you
=
I got goosebumps the whole performance! omg
=
I really love minne and hyejeong voice
=

=
민니 언니 음색에 입덕한 사람입니다,,,,ㅠㅠㅠ정말 또 입덕하게 만드는 저 마성의 음색❤❤❤
=
In my opinion this is the best stage of them, they really touched me and gave me goosebumps, and they harmonized together very well and much more, than the others did, and I think that's what makes a duet a duet, but the others did great as well 😊 I'm very looking forward to the voting results
=
찬미 리액션ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 너무 살갑다ㅎㅎ  완전 좋아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
민니 음색 지린다ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
the height different is cute tho 😂😍
=
민니 외국인 멤인거 잠깐 잊었네ㅡ..
가사 전달력 어쩜 저리 좋나 ....
=
1:54 주접킹ㅠㅠㅠㅠ진짜 방구석 1열 인 거 같은 편안함ㅌㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 성격 호감이다ㅠㅠ!
=
찬미 자연스럽게 언니 호칭 안하기 귀엽다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
This is the unit where i found balance. Their voice are so clean, calm and soothing. They did not overshadowed each other. Their voices supported each other's voice. They matches so well. Wow. And the song is kinda hard to sing too. The control from these two is real good. 👌
=
💚 Keep you over there ‘instagram’
=
혜정 왤캐 이뻐...그냥 이쁜 것도 아니고 성숙하게 이뻐...언니...
=
The rejected one got to perform together producing such amazing performance. Minnie got swag everyone and AOA is not talentless truly a masterpiece
=
2:03 하영언니....?
=
민니 목소리 진심 좋다 ..........!
=
민니언니 음색 그냥 황홀해... 노래해줘서 감사해..사랑해...고마워... 아니 근데 무슨 목소리가 어떤 영상에서 보라색 안개 같다는 댓글  봤는데 딱 맞어... 꿈꾸고 있는 것 같은 느낌을 들게해주는 목소리야..

=
혜정아 사랑해ㅜㅜ 미친 비주얼 미친 목소리 미친 피지컬 ㅎㄷㄷ
=
everyone did a great job but tbh, this unit showed what the real duo is. they didn't outshined each other. Well-balanced voice, the harmonize is on point. I'm so proud! Hoping for these two to win. Fighting AA!!
=
minnie feels like an artist 😍
=
this team is the best!!!!!
=
minnie's voice is very calming and warm, it really sounds relaxing in your ears and its comforting. thank you kim minnie for existing!
=
와 혜정,,,,ㅈㄴ 치여,,,,ㅠㅠㅠ
=
둘다 잘하는데 이곡은 민니가 압도적으로 잘함
=
Minnie, the tone is so pretty.
=
I'm glad that both of them got the chance to showed their vocal on the show because they aren't able to show their real ability in their groups. Minnie's dreamy voice + Hyejeong's soft voice = 🍯
=
크...민니의 허스키한 목소리가 혜정의 맑은 목소리와 잘어울리네
=
Please dean notice these talented girls they did great
=
민니 음색 지리네
=
aoa 지민이 말고는 애들 목소리 평범하다고 생각했는데 저번에는 설현이가 이번에는 혜정이가... 진짜 예쁜 목소리 다 감추두고 사나요ㅠ
=
앞에 효정이랑 박봄 노래부르는거 듣고 왔는데 그 팀은 각각은 잘 부르는데 같이 부르는 부분이 없었고 박봄 파트가 확실히 더 많았음 근데 이 팀은 둘이 목소리가 다른데도 화음이 조화롭고 노래랑도 잘 어울림
=
민니가 진짜 음색이 좋구나
=
minnie has a beautiful and unique voice but can we also appreciate hyejeong's lovely and soft voice?!
=
민니의 중저음의 매력적인 목소리와 애절한 혜정의 목소리가 만나니까 잔잔하면서도 묵직한 느낌이야...천천히 감동을 주는듯한 느낌임ㅠㅠ둘 다 잘한다ㅠㅠㅠ찬미가 혜정이보다 3살 어린데 혜정이 잘하네 하는 것도 웃기고 민니 노래 끝나니까 다시 댕댕이 모드로 돌아와서 해맑게 웃는 것도 귀여워 죽겠음ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
관둘래 이놈의 정보화시대 <- 이 구절에서 못빠져나가고 계속 앞으로 돌려서 무한반복하는중....
=
It’s SO GOOD 😭
My girl Minnie, you are the best girl on our Earth
=
Minieaaaaaaaaaaa<3 saranghaeeeeeee
=
The way their vocals blend is just amazing and perfection...😊💣🖤

=
Hyejeong & Minnie they vocal so ahhhh 😍❤ and they so pretty too
=
For me the best one. The winner duo. Good song, good harmonisation, amazing vocals, both of their vocal colors fit the song, looked like a team! Loved it!
=
퀸덤 보고 내새끼 된 애들 몇 있는데 민니야 너도 내새끼란다..ㅜ 미쳤다 엄청좋다 매일밤 인스타그램 들으면서 울게요ㅠㅠ 아아 사랑해ㅠㅠ

=
The best performance for me so far💖👏
=
They were destined to perform together 😍
=
민니 음색 미친거야?
=
둘다 음색 죽인다 진짜
=
에오에 애들 너무 혜정이만 호응해주는거아닌가ㅠㅠㅠ
물론 혜정이도 진짜 개 잘햇는데
민니 음색이 한 몫 했다 생각하는데ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
3:06 killing part I got goosebumps all over from those two🥺🥺🥺🥺
=
크 이거지
=
민니가 진짜 아이들의 숨은 보석인듯
=
민니넘 끼영웡🧡🧡🧡🧡
=
둘 조합 생각 보다 너무 잘 어울려서 좋다 노래도 분위기도 찰떡이고
=
Hyejeong looks so real. I can't explain it well. It's just that she looks so REAL. 

Like, she grew up from the dark hard times living in New York with her single mom and sibling. Her single mom can barely meet ends pay. Her brother doing drugs on the side, being a drug dealer, trying to help out the family but also throwing his life away. Hyojeong is so young and doesn't know what to do but trouble always finds her. And now she's older and is telling her story. Being grateful that she made it through.

*THAT'S the face she has. The face she's portraying here. To me at least. That's what I mean by REAL. She just seems like she knows how dark and hard old times were.*
=
I forget Minnie is foreigner but the sound really like  Korean
=
DEAN AND OTHER K-URBAN POP ARTISTS, PLEASE HIT UP OUR MINNIE FOR COLLABS I MEAN *ARE YOU HEARING THIS*
AND I AM SO PROUD OF HYEJEONG MY BIAS, SHE IS AN AWESOME TEAM PLAYER BEING ABLE TO HARMONIZE AND COMPLEMENT HER PARTNER WHILE DOING WELL DURING HER SOLO PARTS TOO
=
키차이 뭐임ㅠㅠㅠ 넘 설레잖아유ㅠㅠㅠ 민니음색이랑 혜정장군 음색 미쳤다구요ㅠㅠ 음원빨리 내자ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I genuinely feel Hyejeong can hit high notes but chooses not to showcase them i wonder if she’ll showcase her power vocals like from masked singer on here towards the end. <3 Hyejeong fightin !!!
=
Go up to the 1st because you worth it
=
민니 음색 진짜 매력있다. 무슨 노래를 불러도 민니 스타일로 재해석될 듯. 하루종일 들어도 질리지 않을 것 같네
=
i personally didn’t like the song choice? But damn their VOCALS this is the sultriest duo ever I LOVE IT 🥰🥰🥰🥰
=
민니 보컬 개지린다.. 화사랑 민니랑 둘이 빌리 노래 불럿어야되...
=
This combo is no joke. Minnie did amazing! She was aware that she represents Idle and really did her best. Hyejeong's voice is just so perfect and clear too. I'M SO PROUD
=
STAN HYEJEONG AND MINNIE
=
This show just gave Hyejeong the opportunity to show her voice. So for that reason, thank you Mnet.
=
I wish I had Minnie's voice
=
Mnet should just made it a three category:
1. Six dancers
2. Singing collaboration
3. Rapping

So that each group's rapper has their own spotlight. Well, Bom has Eunjin from brave girls, she can dance and rap
=
혜정장군.. 아기튀밥냥... 일등해줘.. 아아가 체고야..
=
Anything dean is quality.
=
Hyejeong's voice is definitely ANGEL vibe! She's not AOA lead vocalist for nth!!
=
i seriously have problems but hyejeong's voice reminds me of  solar
=
This performance have the most balance combination like they were in one genre but sing it differently and still being the perfect combination, I love it so much
=
Just 3:08 that’s all
=
this video deserves million of views like wtf??????????
=
When Minnie‘s singing “no way no way”
My heart is stolen ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
우우
=
민니 대박이야 진짜 음색미친다 ㅠ
=
데스티니 다음으로 최애동영상 등극함
=
Ambas de branco ficou top!!
=
인스타그램도 좋았지만, 딘의 D를 했다면 더 좋았을거 같다. 하이라이트 부분에서 가창력역시 보여줄수 있었다면 등수도 좀 더 좋은 결과가 있었을텐데
그래도 아아 잘봤어요
=
💐💐💐💐
=
Does this round have a winner?
=
Minnie is soooo beautiful
=
Minnie 🥰 🇱🇦
=
Jimin is there hiding under the jacket because she needs to try and contain the gay
=
Minnie was born to be on stage, look how she really shines whenever she sings and plays piano, she’s just like an fantastic artist ♥︎
=
민니 진짜 미쳤네 소름 돋아 민니 사랑해 음색 개예뻐 ㅠㅠ
=
This was my favorite Duet they both match each others voices well and harmonize were it actually sounds nice on the ears. Its just so ironic they were both not anyone's pick and yet they are prob the most compatible of all the groups. Honestly I knew Minnie had an awesome voice who surprised me here was how amazing Hyejeong can be too.
=
I fell in love with Minnie's voice. 💘💛
=
HYEJEONG AHHHH SHIN HYEJEONG U SLAY IT BABE! U DID WELL 👍👏👏👏👏 HER VISUAL IN THIS PERFORMANCE THO 🔥 HER SOULFUL VOICE & THAT SOULFUL GAZE OH MY GOODNESS. WELL DONE HYEJEONG & MINNIE. MINNIE VOCAL IS SO DAMN UNIQUELY GOOD 👍
=
Yall... I need this on spotify. This is AMAZING. Their combo is NO JOKE!
=
And I'm shook she's Thai 😱
Her pronunciation 😱
=
AOA Shin Hye Jeong <3
=
Listening to this in the morning bring peace to my soul
=
I'm getting serious K Drama vibes and I love it.
=
The time when we get minnie and dean collab
=
To those people who got surprised by our hyejeong hahahaha 😂🤣😂🤣 we already know that she's a good singer and good in harmonizing thats why im not shock that she's the one who was picked for vocal units instead of Yuna thats how Jimin trust her members 😊😊😊😊 and she usually give her members chance to show their talent watch their Reality shows Jimin gives Hyejeong and Chanmi show off their talents in everything 


AOA FIGHTING
=
Solar's face always kills me😂
=
Choa must be so proud for Hyejeong ❤️
=
They did a really good job 👑💜
=
Bom's reaction (around 1:11) to Hyejeong's low notes... Mah queen got the approval of another vocal queen!
=

=
Objectively this unit did the best. They sounded like a real group. Their voices complimented each other perfectly. Plus they both have KILLER techniques. They know how to control their voices! AOA G IDLE FIGHTING TOGETHER!

=
Minnie ahhhhh.
=
◎[▪‿▪]◎  I think during training they ate 'Ultimate High Quality CD 24-bit / 192kHz', right?  (⊙‿⊙✿)
=
민니는 그냥 아티스트같다 .. 민니 나오는 부분이 그냥 솔로 아티스트 공연 장면같아
=
Miss Hyejeong!!!! U’re killin’ me with this look and Minnie’s voice is like WOWW
=
minnie and hyejeong WOW
=
민니 여자딘같다 ㅠㅠ 딘이랑 민니랑 둘이 듀엣으로 노래나오면 개쩔겠다
=
Aghhhr so many queen in this program
=
02:19  이런 분위기 너무 좋아
편안한 느낌
=
1위햇음
=
Their voice is so good, I personally like Hyejeong voice more here, since it sounds more soulful even though when they practiced I fall for Minnie's voice more. The latter part got me more since the 1 minute was a bit too slow and plain for this song.
=
They should work together👍
=
민니 진짜 사랑해... 노래도 잘부르고 막막 스타일도 힙하고 귀엽고 ..막 다해라 너무좋아ㅜㅠㅠ
=
What i love about this performance is they both shine in their own ways. It was simple and clean and yet really brought a great impression by showcasing their great vocals. Who would imagine that they could be this great. ❤
=
*Minnie my baby* I'm crying her voice is so beautiful
=
It just me or it feel like ASMR. Their voice is so sultry that i feel tickled from the inside in my ear
=
they both sounded sooo much better than they did in the practice!! so so amazing and their synergy is crazyy
=
혜정 너무 섹시해 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ발라드인데 섹시댄스 인줄 ㅋㅋ 이래서 본인 성향이 어쩔수 없나보네
=
mijoo: she ain't minnie, she an unnie now
well if this isnt a peak gay comment
=
Now everybody who said minnie is not good vocalist please show them this. I can say minnie has one of unique voice in Korea
=
민니 매번 저렇게 큼직큼직한 옷 입는거 왤케 귀얍지 ㅠㅠ너무 잘어울림
=
민니언니 음색 쩐다.. 와...나중에 솔로로 앨범 하나 내도 좋을듯ㅠㅠ
=

=
2:07 Minnie almost sounds like she’s either gonna laugh or can’t keep from smiling <3 

Either way she looked like she really enjoyed finally performing a song that is her style, I’m so happy for her
=
이 무대가 제일 잘어울린듯
=
Minnie's voice!!!!!! Hyejong's voice!!!! Pretty as they are!....and Minnie is like young Park Bom tho. Give Hyejong and Minnie duet in the future!!!😍😍
=
Now imagine Minnie and Hwasa together omg I’ll die
=
def the best pair out of them! Their voices match together so well and the song suited them!! This was fantastic!!!
=
The way hyejeong went here hoes have a sleek note at 3:14 had me spittin out my chipotle
=
I’M NOT CRYING! YOU ARE!!!!!!! 😭😭😭 So proud of you Minnie!!!
=
Despite them not picking each other, I think they matched well! They sang this beautifully! I hope they win
=
I can't believe that the first girl got rejected 2 times. Bloody hell her vocal is my fave in this episode 💗
=
Really hope they will win cause they vocal is so good and when they sing is not outshine each other.
=
I love Solar's reaction to all these performances
=
OMG HYEJEONG DID SOOOO WELLL!! Her voice is so goooddd
=

I honestly think that its a blessing in disguise that hwasa and bom didnt pick minnie now haha ,look at this amazing piece of art wif hyejeong !
=

FNC and Cube better give them solo songs or at least an ost and please don't sleep on them
=
내 마음속 일등... 둘 목소리 조합이 너무 좋아요.
=
댓글이 죄다 영어네...ㅁㅊ
=
민니는 진짜 슈퍼스타가 될 거 같다

첨에 둘이 등 돌리고 앉아 불렀으면 더 멋있었을듯
=
hyejeong omgg proud of you

=
So proud of Minnie From Thailand 🇹🇭
=
Omgg!!!
=
Hyejeong unnie u did so well. I fall in love with ur voice 😍😍😘😘😘
1:12 Park Bom seem really impressed on Hyejeong's vocal 🤗
=
The were the best together. If it was about cohesion they should definitely win. It melted together. Hwasa and Kei were good but it wasn't as cohesive was more like a collab and Bom just overshadowed her partner.
=
So amazing
=
와  편곡 진짜 세련됐다 ㅠㅠ 민니랑 혜정 목소리 진짜 예쁘다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
hyejeong visual is coming through
=
HYEJEONG CAN HAVE MY WHOLE HEART
=
Haha minnie is so awkward
=
I love Minnie's voice 💕💞🤩
=
I will be shocked if they don’t win. Great performance.
=
내가 생각한 느낌이 아니네...?
=
The moment Minnie and Hyejeong back and back, minnie look so tiny and cute 😍
=

=
Excelente minnie y hyejeong
=

=
Minnieee:)))
=
Голоса очень хорошо сочетаются друг с другом 👍🏻
=
혜정도 잘했는데 인스타그램은 솔직히 음색으로 먹고 들어가는 노래라서 민니가 찰떡인듯
=
다들 눈 아련한것보 ㅏ
=
hyejeonggggg
=
진짜 너무너무너무 잘했는데 뭔가 약해서 불안함 ㅜㅠㅜㅜ 아 나도 본방보고싶다
=
THEYRE THE MOST COHESIVE PAIR WOW
=
ตาย...ตาย...หลงรักเสียงมินนี่
=
이거 음원안나와여?
=
꼴찌하더라도 내 기준에선 탑..... ㄹㅇ로 다른 팀보다 합도 잘 맞고, 민니 음색이 독보적....
=
I’m reporting this video because im so addicted to their voice this is not healthy

=
1- Hyejong and Minnie

3- Hwasa and Kei
=
It fits Minnie's voice so much
=
Hyejeong voice so neat, mature, strong Minnie voice is so R&B, groovy, strong as well.... they both did really well, hope they win .love both love song 😍❤️❤️ both of them so attractive ...
=
Their voices blend so well together wow. This duo was so unexpected but they are IMO the most harmonic one. Hope they win!
=

=
Lol Hyejeong why was Minnie just your second choice and not your first? 😂 This is a perfect pairing and I don't care that they're the ones who were rejected by the others. ❤️ This was beautiful.
=

G-Idle+AoA=Ace of Idles
Neverlands+Elvis=Nelvis
=
Yas Minnie we're proud of you 💜💜

=
Hyejeong 😭
Please take care of my heart, it's all yours

Minnie voice Changes a Lot her tone wuau she is Young and her voice is so versatile
=
Stan talent Stan Minnie 
legend for upcoming!!!!!
=
They're such a perfect duo!!! I really appreciate this show for letting us see different sides of these 2 gems.
Minnie's voice is so unique and captivating. Girl can be cute, sexy, charismatic, cool, badass, creepy whatever u name it. 
Hyejeong's voice is angelic and soothing. She's funny, sexy and can literally be a model. 
Their voices and styles mingle so well to the point midway through the video I even thought of shipping them lmao since Minnie's so cool and chill, while Hyejeong's feminine and attractive omg i just dont know anymore... This turned out to be the most cohesive performance imo.
=

혜정장군 민니 최고시다 ..
=
민니야 풀버전으로 올려줘ㅠㅠ

Del grupo de canto, que menos esperaba... fue el grupo que mejor estuvo de los 3 ... 😍😍 es que no soy fan de ninguna
=
I feel like in this performance , they blended well truly cooperating - the other units members kinda outshined each other ,,,
=
Bommie looks so cute at 1:12
=
اداء ولا ارووووع 😭👏
=
뭔가 핸드폰 소품으로 들고 연기했으면 금상첨화였을 듯 진짜 둘 다 음색 미쳐ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 김민니 목소리 진짜 보물이야 보물ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 무대 아래에선 순둥순둥 귀염둥이다가 무대 위만 올라가면 멋짐 폭발ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Hyejeong's voice gives me goosebumps :)
=
Omg what a great performance, I'm not fan of (G)I-DLE but really loved the voice of Minnie, Hyejeong now has more maturity in her voice ❤️
Ps: Minnie has more covers?
=
비쥬얼까지 미쳤네
=
Minnie's voice is so charming

=
When minnie start singing i literally got goosebumps all over my body
=
both of them did so so well i‘m so proud of them!!💞 amazing singers
=
minnie💘💘
=
This is what happens when the left over rise up and giving us this awesome performance, their voice  has a different tone and that's make it more captivating, mystery and eerie (in a good way) vibes & fells when listening this duet.
=
Wow the brown haired girl has a nice voice
=
LOOK AT MY HYEJEONG 😍 I’m so happy to see her showcasing her talents, when AOA debuted she used to be introduced as ‘lead vocalist’ and when the years past they just made her a visual. But wow ! Both their voices are meant to be with each other their both so angelic !
=
Minnie so good
=
Good job💗. great 👍
=
They should record an audio for this cover, It's really good
=
Fall in love with Minnie once again, her voice melts me it’s so soft and sweet
=
🥰
=
Hyejeong’s vocals oh lordddd💕
=

1:48  민니 졸귀자낰
2:15  귀르가즘 ㅗㅜㅑ
2:51 귀르가즘 2탄!!
=
Omg... this is impossible.... I already watched all perfomances about this chapter of queendom and I can't pick a favourite! All of them did it really well and have it in a really touch voice that made me break or sight for them! For me all of them and the other unit are winners because.... wow I can't tell in any words how they made me feel.... And the two members of G-idle surprise me, Soojin and Minnie were their names? And Hyejeong voice... and... all of the members in this chapter got me in shock. Yep... I can't pick any of them to win because all were really great >^<
=
vocals visuals AND the piano let's get that 1st place
=
Minnie and hyejeong have unique voice
=
I fall in love with Instagram again and again. First time when Dean released this song. The second time when IU covered this song and This version makes me miss this song again and again.
=
Minnie voice... goshh.. international level voice ..wihiiiii...
=
나만별로냐
=
민니 걸어나오면서 웃는데 개멋진데? 슈트핏 쩔어...
=
dude, they better put this on spotify
=
มินนี่ สู้ๆ
=
AA jjang
AA daebak
=
I like Minnie😊
=
Minnie unnie 💜💜💜 Yuqi is me. A proud Neverland here 💜💜💜

AA team for the win 💕 A mixed of an Angelic voice and the sexy voice 💕
=
Omg that girl on keyboard 🤯🤯🤯
=
Minnie is an angel
=
HYEJEONG QUE VOZ ANGELICAL 😍
=
멍때리는 솔라표정은 왜 맨날 보여주는겨
=

=
0:56/1:10 who is the girl with red hair on the left?

=
Omg is it just me or does Minnie sound really similar to dean when singing Instagram 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️👍👍❤️❤️
