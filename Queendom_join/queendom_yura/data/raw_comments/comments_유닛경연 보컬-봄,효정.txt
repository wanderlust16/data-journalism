She's still using 2ne1 mic 😭😭😭 #BLACKJACKS where are we?? 😭😭😭
=
After *Sulli suciede news* , I am very amazed by Park Bom because she can get through difficult times and her depression is very good.  she is the strongest woman ever 😭😭😭😭😭
=
fun fact: this song was written by jyp for bom’s solos debut before 2ne1 12 years ago, but the plans changed and lee hi got the song 3 years later, and now, 2019, she’s singing this song again
=
봄이한테 악플달지 마세요. 성형한 얼굴이 보기싫으면 보지말고, 부정확한 발음과 변한 창법이 듣기 싫으면 듣지 마세요. 악플은 달지 말아주세요. 제 소중한 가수에게 상처주지 말아주세요.
=
She used a green mic just like when she was performing as a member of 2NE1
=
Who are wishing for a 2NE1 Reunion this MAMA 2019?
👇

I saw a comment once saying Park Bom shouldn't Be on this show stating that she is Just an ajhumma she didn't belong on stage. I was so angry and then i was wondering what Kind of comments she had to face all this time... I think that anyone who is into kpop for long knows how hard these pas years have been for Bom it takes a lot of courage and strength to stand on stage after all the struggles she's been through. Don't Be an ass if you can't understand how strong this woman is to try her hardest even when everybody gave up on her. do your researchs before commenting non sens. She got emotional because all the feelings she built up inside came out. I'm rooting for you Bom 💕
=
As a YG stan before, I witnessed how Bom and Lee Hi's relationship is. They're very close and they even had a collab for a christmas song. Everyone in the company's happy, everyone's close and supportive to each other. Every fandoms heart are full of love. And then shit happened. 

Seeing Bom walking with her green mic alone brings back a lot of memories. My blackjack heart can't take it. Hearing news to this show about Bom's standing and everything makes me looked back to her family, were she's bubbly and cheerful. And maybe that's what she's thinking while singing this song close to her heart.

She's now standing alone, like a scarecrow.
=
자기 데뷔할 곡이 하이한테 가고 퉤니원으로 데뷔했다가 지금은 해체하고 혼자 버티는데 데뷔곡으로 무대에 올랐으니 만감이 교차할듯...보는내내 너무 애잔ㅠㅠ
=
박봄이 왜 눈물을 보이는지 그 감정을 뭔가 알 것 같다... 투애니원이 없고 혼자 너무 외로워보여.. 오늘 설리의 안타까운 죽음으로 아이돌의 쓸쓸함이 더욱 와닿아서 박봄의 눈물이 뭔지 알 것 같아
=
녹색마이크 yg에서 못 가져가게 해서 박봄이 사비로 다시 커스텀했다던데 개욕나오네 진짜
=
"모두가 떠나가도 혼자 서있는 허수아비처럼" 이라는 가사가 딱 지금 박봄같아서 너무 슬프다 ㅠㅠ
=
휘갈겨 쓴 편지에서도 진심은 느낄 수 있지. 음정 박자가 흔들리는 노래에서도 감동은 느낄 수 있는거고...
=
그냥 박봄 목소리 듣자마자 내목이 메인다... 왜인지 무슨 마음인지 모르겠는데 그냥 너무 먹먹하다
이런게 노래에 담긴 마음이느껴지는 그런것인가 슬프고 안쓰럽고 아프네
=
She can't hold her emotions doesn't mean that she is bad singer. You didn't go through her situation.you are not hurt. You don't know the feeling.you've never experience anything. So please don't judge quickly
=
this is what queendom should be about- no ranks, no competition, just saying our faves sharing the stage together
=
I see boms ayes tearing and she's very tired she literally miss 2ne1
=
첨엔 흔한 발라드인줄 알았다가.. 봄파트 시작되니까  고급지네.. 무대가 다르긴 다르다
=
Queendom is not a competition anymore. Mnet just showcase them and I appreciated them all. They are all QUEENS PERIODT.
=
2019 is the saddest year.
=
Why this is so sad? I can feel Park Beom’s pain. She such a strong woman!
=
개인적으로, 봄이 과거를 뭍고 이젠 현재를 살면 좋겠다. 과거 2ne1 의 박봄이 아니라 솔로가수 박봄으로.
=
Bom using her 2NE1 mic is making me think I need 2NE1. Even if they aren’t together I need them to be
=
For 5 years Bom was by herself and like a scarecrow people avoided her, even scared to mention her name. Bom deserves the stage.
=
마지막에 혼자서있는 허수아비처럼 울때 진짜 나도 모르게 울었음 노래듣고 우는 사람들 이해못했는데 .. 저 소절에 다 이해됐다
=
*I stand alone even after everyone leaves, like a scarecrow*

I cried watching this. The lyrics matches Bom very well. No wonder she cried so much. She is alone. And she is probably even more alone in a competition with other girl groups while she sits in a waiting room on her own.
=
봄이언니가 부른 허수아비는
목소리가 아닌 마음으로 부른 
노래라고 생각합니다.
=
When bom start to 
sing My heart hurts😭😭😭
=
Why nobody is talking about HYONJUNG here. She really did a great job.. and so is Park Bom. That last part made me teary too.
=
Bom and Taeyeon are the only singers that can make me feel the emotion of the songs even if I don't understand any words of it.
=
가사는 없어도 음정과 목소리로 가사에 담긴 감정을 표현하는 거 같다... 가사 안 보고 들어서 잘 안 들려도 마지막에 박봄울때 같이 울어버림...
=
There is so much I want to say about this video. First, Hyojung, what a talent. Never heard of her before, but she impresses. The emotion she convey's is great.

That out of the way, man, Bom what an authentic, beautiful performance. What a journey she has had to this point. There are people criticizing her for breaking down at the end. Why? Absolutely, she is professional singer, but around the world, passion is valued far more than professionalism in music. Look at how far this woman has come THIS YEAR ALONE. Park Bom has risen from the ashes. Since 2014, this woman has faced adversity from all sides and in 2018 gave an interview about how she couldn't even go out into public. Now, at 35(old by Korean standards, but experienced by world standards), she has really blasted back onto the scene with two great EP's, a ton of live performances and great collaborations.

It's no wonder Bom would have such a powerful reaction to a song like this(look up the lyrics). I've seen very terrible comments(thankfully much more positive though) across the kpop sphere. Bom literally experienced near five years of loneliness after her scandal. Something like this would be incredibly close to her heart. I think it's amazing that she feels so strongly of the lyrics she sings. Bom is a wonderful talent, it's clear so many younger singers look up to her. Such a powerful performance should be embraced, not scorned.
=
bro when bom cried i couldn't hold it, we could see that hyojung was feeling her pain as well
=
Hear that a girl screams "Don't cry" to Park Bom makes me wants to cry more.. 😢
=
Bom. Green mic. And the song that was initially written and meant for her to sing.
Funny that I started crying at the moment her voice croaked.
=
“👁👁”
    👃🏻
    👄
solar,, 2019
=
Park bom she is angel she deserve a lot of love
=
진짜 박봄은 잠꼬대를 해도 사람들이 잘 부른다 할 것 같다
=
"Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself" - the last line when bom cried 😭😭😭😭
=
She uses her green mic
ALSO TO AVOID MIC PROBS.
=
GD thinks: Bom is one of a kind!!!!
=
Everyone else is missing the good old days when we still have all our four girls on stage performing their hearts out. And because of circumstances that we cannot avoid or wasnt planning we now see her compete against other groups alone. But do not worry our dear bom for we are still here to support you. From the beginning until now, we are here for you. And we know, one day, sooner or later you'll be there on stage again with them and us cheering our hearts out.
=
Park boom cry...


2ne1: queens assemble for backup 


Me: 😱 dead
=
박봄에 대해서 선입견을 많이가지고 있었습니다. 하지만 그녀가 과거를 씻어내고 미래에도 빛날 수 있겠다는걸 이 무대를보고 알았습니다
=
아니 편집할꺼면 제대로 하던지 싱크도 안맞고 진짜 엠넷 마음에 드는게 하나도 없네
=
Who else is going back and forth between this and Bom and Dara singing "Lonely"?
=
진짜 박봄 평생 노래해줬으면 좋겠음 ㅠㅠ진짜로 죽을때까지 들어도 안질릴거같아
=
HYOJUNG AND BOM if u support them

👇make this blue
=
Me crying like baby and there is Solar's face had me 😂
=
This songs makes me cry, all the emotions about 2NE1 and now about everything that has happened about Sulli, makes me even sadder.
=
오랜시간을 함께했던 그룹과 맴버들이 사라지고 박봄이 얼마나 외로웠고 힘들었을지가 보이네 .. 가사가 자기의 얘기처럼 느껴졌을거같다
=
a lot are saying that they dont know the lyrics so here it is fam:
They say to me, “Why don’t you know -
That no matter what kind of love it is, it all changes after time passes”
They say that even after 1 year, things change from now
And that there won’t be any painful things then
But I know my heart very well
I know so well that it won’t change
Because everyone has a soul mate in this world
And that kind of love cannot be forgotten

You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can’t forget you like this
Like a scarecrow, who stands alone even after everyone leaves

After the sun sets and everyone goes home
I am standing alone in a wide field
Little by little, I can’t see ahead of me because of the darkness
It makes me more and more afraid of being alone but
When I opened my tightly shut eyes at some point
Beautiful stars were shining
Like the images of you, who left far away
As I looked at them, I prayed that you’ll come back to me some day

You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can’t forget you like this
Like a scarecrow, who stands alone even after everyone leaves

You may think that I forgot about you (oh, you may think that I)
You may thing that I am happy with someone else (forgot you)
But I still can’t forget you like this (I can’t forget)
Like a scarecrow, who stands alone even after everyone leaves
(Even if you leave me, I’m like a scarecrow)

Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself
=
"I stand alone even after everyone leaves...
Like a scarecrow..."

oh my God, im bawling my eyes out! only park bom can make me cry!
=
While everybody's talking about bom, here i am admiring Hyojung♥️ i could feel her sincerety
=
After all she has been through, this song was so emotional. Bommmmmm, blackjacks are always here for uu <3 :(
=
I can't even understand a single thing about what they're singing. But I did cry when Bom started singing
=
다른무대처럼퍼포먼스나 여러명이 없어도.. 뭔가 감정전달고 진심이느껴져서 같이슬퍼지고몰입된다ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ왤케슬프지
=
When someone shouted "Don't cry" yet I'm crying hard. 😭😭
=
Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself
=
im so proud of bommie, her voice is soulful as ever.
=
I fell more hurt because of what happened to sulli 😭😭. . Bom I'm so proud of you please find love and inspiration to face this cruel life here on earth. .. don't forget we love you😭😭 fighting bom..
=
Bommie is really strong, imagine the hate she gets back then and until today from knetz and some kjournalist for almost a decade, but sometimes its ok to cry let it all out you will feel better and by now those a**sholes realized that bommie can't be defeated.
=
투애니원이 많이 그리워보인다 ㅜㅜ 박봄 언니 화이팅 투애니원은 사실 심사위원 석에 앉아있어야 할 그룹인데 후배 아이돌들과 같이 경쟁하는 용기가 멋있어요 퀸덤 화이팅
=
No olvidar votar por Park Bom en los MAMA 2019 ✌️
=
Bom is really soul singer,she's my best girl and my heart aches for her...She deserves all she wants!💕
=
I’m a bj myself but can we appreciate hyojung’s vocals as well☹️❤️ She also did such a phenomenal job but all I see are comments about bom. I love her too and my heart hurts that she was crying. I feel like hyojung is under appreciated sometimes. hehe. Love them both dearly and just wish them the best always!👍🏻❤️❤️
=
Bom and Hyojung looked like in the pain with a different cause. Bom with the traumatized past and Hyojung with the current broken heart. They just like a couple of sister who shares their pain to each other in order to heal each other too. Wow.
=
양혐석 넌 평생 발뻗고 편하게 잘생각하지마라
=
Everyone cries when bom sings at the end it was really tearyy
=
im glad that im not the only one whose cry while watching this
=
Sulli from Fx just attempted suicide cause of bullying, depression etc and now she's gone R.I.P. knetz neeeds to stop bashing or hating on this beautiful idol we all know mentally parkbom had affected alot of issues that she encountered previously. But aiming and gaining her popularity again is really an awesome decision that she's done and well parkbom your really the best! You're not one we are here Blink,Blackjacks,Army,ExoL,Once,Sones,VIP and alot of fandom aiming you to win for Queendom because as a solo artist she doesn't stressed at all and she got invited by mnet to be the one Biggest Competitor on Queendom because her fandom,  her popularity her wealth and her soulful emotional voice capture alot of people reaching across the world. Even she doesn't winn i will still pray that i hope she will win!!! Because she deserves it.

I know exactly this song is belong to park bom when listening to this song.
=
청아하고 단단한 목소리랑 그루브하고 소울풀한 목소리랑 이렇게 잘 어울릴 줄은...
박봄만 보면 왜이렇게 눈물이 나는지ㅜㅜㅜ 진짜 너무 외로워보이고 쓸쓸해보여서 가슴아프다... 퀸덤에서 후배들이랑 많이 친해졌으면 ㅠㅠㅠ 근데 박봄 목소리 진짜 넘사벽이다 .. 너무 좋아
=
I love them both. My heart, their voices are too sad.
=
박봄의 말하듯 쓸쓸함이 느껴지는 노래부분도 좋지만 효정의 음색도 감성적이고 매력적이네요...후렴구중에...다른 사람과 행복한줄 알겠지만 나는 아직도~이부분 몇번을 돌려보고 있습니다.^^
=
Our Leader CL said : You don’t understand the language but you can feel the music 🙏🏻
I think i know what this means 🖤
I don’t understand the lyric but i now crying so badly🙏🏻
Plz stay strong 🖤
=
after lee hi with "breath" this is 2nd song that make me feel sad
=
다른팀들은 다 여러명이서 화목한데 매 경연 마다 혼자 대기실에 앉아서 대화 나눌 사람도 없이 멍하니 다른팀들 보다보면 2ne1 생각도 많이 나고 외롭고 슬플텐데 허수아비 라는 곡이 딱 박봄이 겪는 감정을 극대화 시켜주는 노래였던 것 같음
=
When I read the title of the song (Lee Hi - Scarecrow) : "Oh this will be a rather sad song" 🙂
When Hyejeong started singing it : "okay I'm still fine" 😅
when Bom eonni started singing it : "I can't take it anymore" 😭
=
개인적으로 박봄 목소리 너무 좋아하지만 전곡 박봄 목소리로만 듣기에는 조오오금 느끼한 피자 먹는 느낌인데 효정이가 중간에 피클역할을 해줘서 참 듣기 좋다
=
봄아 너 너무 예뻐, 너를 좋아하는 너의 팬들에게 넌 너무 소중한 존재야.. 이제 용기내서 앞으로 나와주렴, 너의 목소리.. 너의 재능.. 얼마나 감사한것인지.. 너를 많이 사랑하길바란다, 박봄 화이팅!👍
=
"  *Like a scarecrow, standing* *all by myself*  "
=
원래 박봄이 하려했던 노래였던것과 가사가 혼자 서있는 허수아비 이러니까 그동안 그룹으로 활동해왔다가 혼자 무대를 해오니 많이 벅차올랐나봄..
=
Sulli must have feel what this song illustrate. I wish she is in a good place now
=
Like 5 minutes since the song ends, i still cant hold back my tears. I cried right after hearing Bom’s voice, dont know the reason. Everyone say they dont care abt rank but i dont, I want to see Bom gets 1st rank on music show to let her know she is the best and still be cared and loved
P.s: the song’s even more hurt after sulli’s gone
=
Bom when she sings sad song.. U r going to get depressed.😂😂😂😂. Her voice is just so. I dont have a word.i loveeee it.
=
Realmente hermoso, un gran sentimiento que llega hasta el corazón. Park bom i love u #2ne1 #Blackjack
=
Everyone : Why Bom crying ?
Literally everyone : know the answer to this already
Because we’re her fan and been through a lot with Bom so I guess she miss 2ne1 so much and this song mean so much to her
=
진짜 가수다운 무대
노래에서 감정을 전하는 진짜 가수 박봄
=
HyoJung showed so much love and support to Bom. Their clips of interactions were so natural. She really wanted to be paired with her. ❤️ #BomJjung
=
This is the power of Park Bom's voice everyone. Whether you understand the lyrics or not, she can make you feel emotions and her music pierce through your heart. This is one of the reasons why 2ne1 is a once in a life time girl group.
=
1:40부터 진짜 울컥해서 겨우부른거 느껴짐 목에 벌써 감정이 올라와서 목이 막힘...진짜 개인적으로 너무너무좋았던 무대
=
'혼자 서 있는 허수아비처럼..' 이러니 투애니원 멤버들이 생각이 날 수밖에.. ㅠㅠㅠ 봄이 언니 많이 많이 행복하세요.. 그리고 언젠가 꼭 기회가 된다면 투애니원 멤버들을 꼭 한 무대에서 다시 볼 수 있었으면 좋겠어요 제발..
=
When i hear her voice i always want to cry...Bom's voice will always have a special place in my heart! 🥺❤
=
She's really singing a song meant for her.. It's her song😭 You're such a strong person bommie. We're so proud you made it out of those days💜
=
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO CRY LIKE THIS 😭
=
역시 박봄이다 효정도 박봄 옆에서 부족하다고 하나도 안느껴질 정도로 너무 잘했다!!
=
I feel pain in them both, I think that makes this one of the best performances in queendom
=
Parkbom is nominated for Best vocal solo performance in MAMA 2019! Please vote her 🙏
=
From the start, I can really feel that she's holding back her tears while singing.. I know Bommie's voice very well. Ooohh my blackjack heart ♠️💔😭😭😭 I miss 2NE1 specially my Forever Maknae Gong Minzy (Mingkki) 💜
=
I'm crying while watching this 😭😭😞😞
Specially when Park Bom Cried 😭😭😢😢
=
I think my face looked like Moonbyul’s and Jimin’s during this performance. It’s so heart wrenching. Bom deserves so much love and care. ❤️❤️❤️
=
It's like "here i am unloading every negative vibes that I've been having for the past years" and bom even used her 2ne1 mic  .mah heart mah soul 😭😭😭😭
=
Parkbom is nominated for Best vocal solo performance in MAMA 2019! Please vote her 🙏
=
Omg when Bom cried during this performance I couldn’t help but cry as well. Bom Unnie! All the Blackjacks around the world all love you soooooo much!
=
이 큰 아이돌 시장에서 3대 소속사라고 하던 YG 소속 그룹으로 전성기를 펼쳤고, 온갖 구설수에 휘말리며 회사라는 이름도 그룹의 이름도 쓰질 못하게 되었을 때 꼭 가사와 같은 느낌이었겠지. 깜깜한 허허벌판에 나 홀로 서 있는 느낌.. 다시 솔로 가수로 재개하면서 모든 미디어의 관심과 궁금증을 혼자서 답해내야 했고. 열살 넘게도 차이나는 아이들과 대선배로서 ‘경연’하는 프로그램에 나오는 그 마음가짐과 심정이 어땠을지ㅠㅠ
=
I absolutely feel sad and lonely listen to this
=
Bom and Miyeon could've been the. BEST OF THE BEST CHOICE. Nonetheless, this duet is good. Of course, legend Bom.
=
그냥 처음 노래 부를때부터 눈물났어ㅜㅜ목소리가 너무 슬프다..
=
I don't understand the lyrics but I can feel the pain or sadness. 🥺
Such a strong/ tough person and talented singer. 👏
First time I heard her song "You & I", I thought it's an english song sang by international singer. Then I  know that it's #Bom, a main vocalist of #2NE1. I miss them so much. 😢

박봄님 목소리가 유난히 왤케 꾹꾹 눌린 것 같이 들리나 했더니 울음 참고 계셨구나ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
가사 한 소절 한 소절 너무 잘 꽂혀서 같이 울어버렸음 둘 다 너무 잘했다 진짜
=
I love how park bom take care hyojung and other oh my girl member (from strangers became bestfriend)they really like a family 😭, hyojung can hide her feeling but when she with parkbom she express her emotions 😭 they feel the same pain... Please take care our parkbom and OH MY GIRL ❤
=
This is so heartbreaking to watch.... im crying too..😭
=
I dnt even knw the lyrics but I cried while watching because I can feel the emotions. Blackjacks will always support the four of you, Bom. Love from Philippines. 🇵🇭
=
I am hoping to see at MAMA 2019 our 2NE1 together 😭😭😭😭
=
그냥 어느 부분에서 소름 돋았다 할 거 없이 매순간마다 소름 돋고 이상하게 울컥한다 특히 마지막에 박봄이 울 때 나까지 눈물이 남... 봄앤쩡 너무 대박이고 너무 몰입되는 무대다
=
i dont understand anything but i can feel how sad the lyrics should be :’(
=
I don't even know the lyric, but why i wanna cry, my eyes watery 😥
=
I really cried a lot when park bom start to cry grrr😭 be strong park bom! Godbless😘😇
=
My heart is crying 😭
=
bom: *sings*
everyone: *felt that*

im crying wtf
=
3:58 tuve la misma reacción. 😢
=
When Bom start singing, I crying too
=
Seeing Bommie cry really breaks my hearts but i'm so proud that she did so well fighting all troubles she had 😭❤️
=
How many times when I watching this video I also cried, be strong hyo jung and bom unnie 😘😘
=
아진짜 이 가사는 박봄이 부르면서 안 울수가 없는거 같다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ보는 나도 눈물나는데 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
When Bom starts singing. I started to cry. We love you Bom. We felt it with your song. 😭❤
=
0:58 I got goosebumps and when Bom started to sing... I can't!!!!!! I keep watching with teary eyes
=
every time bom sings im always having goosebumps its just that i miss the old gen kpop
=
I thought I couldn't hear Bommie singing anymore after the disbandment. Thank to those who made it happened 💓 And I really love how Hyojung sang. It was really great💓
=
진짜 가사가 박봄이랑 너무 잘어울린다고 해야하나....? 딱 박봄이 하고 싶어하는 말을 노래로 표현한 것 같다....효정도 너무 감정 잘 살리고 진짜 둘이 잘어울린다......
=
정말 놀라운 최고의 프레젠테이션은 아름답고 진정한 감정으로 가득합니다.
=
Hyojung with Bom..
Oh my God.....
Princess with Queen
=
I'm stanning her since I saw her on fire mv until today I'm still with her :'( no one can change that. Park bom such a strong woman 😞 I love her with all my heart 💕
=
Everytime I hear Park Bom sing 😭😭 heartfelt
=
모두가 떠나가도 혼자 서있는 허수아비처럼
가사가 안 울수가 없다ㅠㅠ
=
2Ne1 In Mama 2019
=
the first time i hear about this song and watch their performance in queendom singing this song scarecrow and know through bom about the meaning of the song i feel the sadness and cried while watching this.. especially seeing bom cried i feel her sadness and hyojung was excellent singer and they really showed what the song wants to deliver.
=
Goosebumps 😭 i dont understand a word but girl, I feel it. I feel every pain, sadness and sorrow. 😭 I can't help but to cry... 😭😭
=
when park bom come in i just realized that im crying :")
=
박봄 혼자라는 생각 자주들거같다 ㅠ 힘냈으면
=
Hyojung 😍❤
Bom ✊💖

👏👏👏👏👏
=
2:51 my parents after seeing me crying at a song i dont even understand
=
Am I the only one crying now.
The moment they started singing the first verse I started crying because I use to feel lonely. 
And this just got to me.
=
From the start of the song,I could feel Their Emotions Right away!It makes My Tears flow Their own 😭
=
난 개인적으로 박봄님이 이해간다
다른팀들은 멤버들이랑 같이 있는데 박봄은 혼자 나와서 홀로 서있으니까 2ne1멤버들 많이 생각나겠지.. 그리고 지금 박봄님 나이가 36인데.. 많이 힘들고 외로울 거 같다
=
Bom can do better, it's like when YG mafe her sing while recovering from her sickness, do you guys remember ?
=
Imagine what will happen if Bom invites CL, Dara, Minzy to perform with her in Queendom
=
Thanks Queendom for letting Hyojung sing a ballad song again and thank you Bom for being a big sister to our Hyojung. Both of you are amazing singers 😄
=
still put me in tears after watching this for several times,, fighting!!!
=
난 오히려 박봄의 떨리듯 끊어질듯한 저 창법이  가사전달을 더 잘되게 하는거같음  잘들어보면 단어뿐만아니라 숨소리에서까지 슬픔 공허 그리움 아쉬움 같은게 녹아있는듯함ㅠ 정말 이 허수아비란 곡은 박봄에겐 데뷔곡이 아니라 이런 상황들을 예측해서 미리 만들어진 노래같음.. 꽃길만 걷길ㅠ
=
Why am I so affected that I also tear up when I watch this? 😭💚
=
Weeeey bom anda bien sad últimamente:'( ❤❤❤❤ en el sentimiento por 2ne1💔💔💔
=
I can hear the pain in her voice.
=
Bom is queen and hyojung is princess. Thank you hyojung and bom for such a beautiful performance.
=
어쩌면 메이저 케이팝 시장에 남아있는 2ne1멤버는 이제 박봄 혼자 서있으니까.. 감정이 복받친게 아닐까 근데 그게 더 감정이 좋다..
=
Bom's voice is so heart-wrenching! It felt like she stabbed my heart!
=
Bom she's a queen👑😍💕 México support you❤️😘
=
I AM WATCHING THIS WHILE CRYING BECAUSE OF SULLI NEWS. THIS IS SO HEARTBREAKING NEWS, MY HEART IS VERY HEAVY, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, WHY DID YOU LEFT US 😭 RIP SULLI. 💔
=
Bom got me crying in my cereal 😭😭 I love her sm!!
=
눈 감아줄테니까 프로그램 서바이벌 없애라... 콜라보 너무 좋음ㅠㅠ 멤버들끼리 친해지는 거 너무 좋다 누구 떨어지면 팬이든 아니든 속상할 듯ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Can't wait for next episode..Park Bom gonna sing Eyes,Nose,Lip by taeyang OMGG
=
both were amazing like for real this was perfect and so emotional
=
I cried so bad, Bommie I'm here with u since 2009, fighting my love!!!!!
=
I got so much chills when Bom sang makes me wanna cry
=
무대위에서 울컥하거나 우는게 프로답지 못하다는건 아니라고봄
박봄의 솔로 데뷔곡이 될 수도 있던곡에 가사 하나하나가 현재 투애니원에서 홀로서기한 박봄의 모습을 얘기하는것 같고 12년만에 무대에서 불러보는 노래인데 박봄의 입장으로서는 충분히 북받쳐 올수 있다고 생각함.. 시작부터 울음참느라 되게 먹는 느낌 나는건 아쉽지만
그냥 프로답지 못하니 뭐니 하는 사람들의 공감능력이 떨어진다고 생각함
=
1:50 omg SAME i got goosebumps when Bom appeared
=
i cried :( park bom im here for u queen❤
=
Her voice really unic
=
Bom Number one her voice 😭😭😭❤️😍😍
=
매번 박봄무대만 싱크안맞게 편집해서 립싱크란 오해받게만드는 이유가 뭐냐 엠넷ㅅㅂ
=
Park boms voice is teally heart breaking.
=
3:27 omg park bom's hair is so freaking long
=
This performance has got a strong emotion... Their voice was represented how much the pain that caused from broken heart. I cried but yes I love this show
=
Lord the ones who hurt the most always sing with the most emotion. We love you Bommie
=
I really hope Bom gets some votes, she deserves so much as a soloist. she really felt so bad when she rank 5th 2x 😭
=
I cried when Bom started singing even when i cant understand
=
imma fight those 621 dislikers 

Who’s with me? Lololololol

So happy this two touched so many hearts 🥺🥺🥺❤️
=
idk when Bom started to cry, my tears were also shedding :(((((( BOM <3... i am here with you... hope you'll see my love for you
=
i love this version too besides lee hi....
=
the green mic alone is making me feel things already
=
The song made me cry 😭😭😭😭
=
나는 왜 효정이 파트에서 눈물이 줄줄이지ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
This is so hard to watch. 😭
=
I really love them and I hope they win 1st! They deserve it!
=
진짜 박봄은 라이브 현장 노래 목소리 들어 봐야함 진짜로 ,, 걍  그 음색은 ,,
=
My eyes are all sweaty from this performance 😭
=
박봄이 여기무대만스면 기계소리가 나네 흠.. 왜그러지 옛날엔 맑았는데 ㅠ
=
If we have a kingdom boy version I want these boy groups 
BTOB or pentagon cuz you know the enlistment (all of the ptg produced) 
Victon (I know but they have REALLY TALENTED MEMBERS) 
Voisper
Stray kids 
Jung seunghwan
=
Estas canciones me dan ese sentimiento de querer llorar 😓😢😭🤧
=
아 이 무대 진짜 기대 했는데...아쉽네...박봄 중반부터 계속 억지로 울음 참느라 호흡이 무너져가지고 아쉽게 됐음. 지난번 2ne1 제스쳐도 그렇고 이번 곡 선정도 그렇고 여러모로 과거를 사무치게 그리워하는듯 한데 그나마 최근들어 옛날 모습 다시 찾아가는거 같아서 너무 보기 좋은 와중에 이거 때문에 풀죽지 않길 바람 ㅜㅜ... 2ne1도 하루 빨리 다들 계약기간 끝나고 브아걸처럼 다른 소속사에서 다시 뭉쳤으면 좋겠다 진짜 이렇게 끝내긴 너무 안타까운 그룹임...네명 다 더 나이들기 전에 젭알 좀 ㅜㅜ
=
She used her 2ne1 mic then she made another version of the song lonely with Dara. Homecoming of the Queens are near
=
Damn this is one of my favourite songs!!!!!!! Yesssss! So much emotion
=
박봄은 원래 좋아했는데 퀸덤 보고 효정이 진짜 너무 호감됨ㅠㅠ 둘이 너무 잘어울리고 이 팀이 개인적으로 제일 좋았다
=
It makes me cry 😭 fighting Bom unnie 😀
=
박봄 데뷔곡으로 ㅇㅎㅅ이 박진영한테 곡 부탁해 만든 곡이 허수아비임 근데 박봄 2NE1으로 데뷔해 가요계 휩쓸었음 박봄 노래들 보면 만들어져있던 곡을 부른게 아니라 박봄 부르라고 만든 곡들
=
This makes me cry 😢 fighting bom unnie 🥺
=
They’ve both been through so much. RESPECT RESPECT!
=
I miss 2ne1 😭 it felt that Bom miss her group mates 😭😭 oh that song😭😭 fighting Bom
=
Hyojung my queen ❤️❤️❤️
=
퀸덤이 외국프로그램인가 댓글에 한글을 못찾겠네;
=
Mic boM, i think her miss them "2ne1" 😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤💪💪💪💪
=
TRULY EMOTIONAL. I WAS HOLDING BACK THE WHOLE VIDEO AND I CAN SEE BOM TRYING TO UNTIL THE END HAPPENED
=
Bom. I really love you. Stay strong. ❤
=
i dont understand any of the words but I felt the emotion. hyojung and bom really did a good job. for me, it does nit matter if they didn't win but gosh, this performance is so pure
=
I started crying when I saw Bom's green mic 😭
=
hyojung did amazing!!! legendary
=
Onions everywhere... 😭
=
Bom&Jung forever <3
=
봄이가 많이 슬플만하지... 이런 외로운 분위기의 노래를 부르면서.. 투애니원 멤버들도 많이 생각나고 뭔가 미안함도 있고 혼자 있던 외로움 들도... 많은 감정들이 북 받쳐서 울은듯...이제는 진짜 봄이만의 봄길을 걷길 바라며.... 돈 크라이라는 노래도 냈으면서 더 이상 울지 않았음 좋겠어요♡ 울 뽀미 봄쉘들이 항상 응원 할께요!!!
=
Im cryin', eventho i dont i understand TT
=
OMG!!! This emotional performance brings me to tears... I cant stop crying from Bom’s part and my heart hurts...
=
Damn there was so much of emotion in BOM'S voice 😭😭😲💓💓😘💘
=
I love u park bom your the best Kpop Girl singer in my heart!!
=
아니 이해 안돼는게 왜 매번 박봄 무대만 싱크 밀리게 해서 내보내냐... 편집자가 박봄 안티인가?? 이것땜에 매번 립싱크 아닌데 립싱크라고 욕먹잖아...
=
Candy leader's sweet voice is great! Hyujong hwaiting!
=
I witnessed this performance the first time as a full Blackjack. I'm coming back here as a Miracle as well just to appreciate this performance that my two queens have made. Hyojung is one of the gems of today's Kpop generation. She is such a great leader and I really appreciate how she worked with Bom. She took all of Bom's lessons to the heart and made this masterpiece. I really wish Bom and Hyojung could collab again so my Blackjack-Miracle heart will once again be content.
=
You make me happy just hear you sing 
Your beautiful voice is the guilding light for me
Thank you
=
I don't know why as soon as Bom sang I get teary 😭😭
=
Damn first 5 sec of this song makes me tear up already. This is so deep.
=
When I saw that green mic I lost it T.T
=
Wow. They deliver the song very well. It's sound so sad..OMG why I'm tearing so hard
=
Bom using a green mic makes me cry 😭 I wanna see the Yellow/Gold, Orange, and purple mics 😢 I really miss 2ne1 💔
=
When Jeong was singing the high notes, Bom was already stopping herself from crying so she couldn’t fully harmonize with Jeong. This performance hurts as a blackjack and bomshell, the only way you could interpret this was that Bom was in complete darkness for 5 years trying to claw her way out of that dark pit of loneliness was a huge struggle for her and clearly, she’s still hurting from everythong that happened.
=
English translation of the lyrics

Scarecrow
They say to me, “Why don’t you know -
That no matter what kind of love it is, it all changes after time passes”
They say that even after 1 year, things change from now
And that there won’t be any painful things then
But I know my heart very well
I know so well that it won’t change
Because everyone has a soul mate in this world
And that kind of love cannot be forgotten

You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can’t forget you like this
Like a scarecrow, who stands alone even after everyone leaves

 After the sunsets and everyone goes home
I am standing alone in a wide field
Little by little, I can’t see ahead of me because of the darkness
It makes me more and more afraid of being alone but
When I opened my tightly shut eyes at some point
Beautiful stars were shining
Like the images of you, who left far away
As I looked at them, I prayed that you’ll come back to me some day

 You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can’t forget you like this
Like a scarecrow, who stands alone even after everyone leaves

You may think that I forgot about you (oh, you may think that I)
You may thing that I am happy with someone else (forgot you)
But I still can’t forget you like this (I can’t forget)
Like a scarecrow, who stands alone even after everyone leaves
(Even if you leave me, I’m like a scarecrow)

 Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself
=
i love bom so much:(
=
1:13 Is it just me? When Bom said the first syllable (not even a word), I felt all her emotions. She really is a legendary!!
=
RIP Sulli... I loved F(x) as much as 2NE1 and I'm so sad that Sulli was alone, dealing with her issues... I hoped for Bom and Sulli to get together one day... Both of them went through alot, may she rest in peace </3
=
자꾸 싱크안맞아서 립싱크라고들하시는데 그럼 박봄이 울때 숨소리이런건 뭘까요.. 띵킹하고 댓글달아주세요:D
=
TE AMO PARK BOM
=
So emotional 😭
=
As I am writing this tears are falling down my face this was a beautiful performance by Park Bom and OMG Leader Hyo I am very proud of you both know that Blackjacks and Miracles will always be with you to the very end. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
So sad.. My tears drop.. 😭 I feel u bomi.. She has been through a lot of hardships. Her path is full of thorns, full of sadness and loneliness .. But I really2 respect & adore her, because she never gave up no matter how hard it is , she's still trying to get up. Bom, you are my truly idol. I will always Love you. ..
=
효정은 진짜 발라드 스타일인거같고 박봄은 음색 자체가 팝댄스곡에 최적화 되있는데 뭔가 절묘하게 발라드에선 박봄만의 느낌이 있음
=
i'm cryingggggggggggggg, my lovely ParkBom  <3
=
It was a sad feeling ! We love you Bom and love 2NE1 forever
=
I realy like ParkBoom, I always support her!! Fighting!!  ❤
=
I am so emotional to see bom, i can feel her even i don't know about that song
=
아 이건 내가 박봄이라도 울었다.. 울면서봤네 진짜ㅠ
=
Ah I can't stop crying even after watching.. Coz I can feel the pain she suffered. It breaks my heart. Glad she's back and doing what she love most. Love you Bom! You did well!
=
Wow. That is just awesome. I'm not really a fan of Park Bom, but I appreciate her ability to sing and how she can dissolve herself in this song. It is so good. The crying part is the best ever. I always always always love singers who can showcase their emotions!!! 

Fyi I blame YG for doing shit to them and their group.
=
The song’s origin and the 2NE1 microphone. There’s just much I can take in one performance. 😭 Hyojung and Bom did amazing, my heart was aching. Their ability to convey the emotion of the song shows how much great of a singer artist they are.
=
Who's crying? I'm crying!
=
박봄이 투애니원 멤버들한테 바치는 노래같다
=
I am crying right now. Bom, why? I love you!
=
Why iam crying 😢 😢😥I felt the pain the song 💔😔😢
=
I’m on my tears
=
난 퀸덤 무대 다 통틀어서 이 무대가 젤 좋음ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
아무것도 모르는 세상이 박봄에게 돌 던질때 돌에 맞았을 박봄이 너무 안타까움.. 옥수수 하나에 행복했던 박봄인데 너무 각박한 세상이 사람 숨통 조여옴.. 물적으로 풍족한 시대가 온건 좋지만 그것만큼 경쟁하고 이겨야하기때문에 사람들 마음마저 날카로워지고 헐 뜯는게 아무런 문제가 없는것처럼 되버림...
=
I’m not crying outside but inside it’s killing me can felt her feelings through this kind of thing be strong bommie 💚
=
The GREEN MIC IS BACK
#2NE1 IS LIFE❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
So proud of Park Bom and Hyojung for choosing this song and giving strength to others!! Fighting!!
=
Bom 😭💖
=
투애니원은 거의 다 알다시피 비즈니스 관계보다 더 끈끈했음 서로 그리워하는것도 너무 보였고 .. 물론 박봄은 솔로로서도 개쩜 근데 ㅠ 개인적으로 투애니원 너무 그림다
=
i dont know why bom Voice make me cry
=
Im not a singer but i know how it feels, thank god have have real friend ❤ i love you bommie ❤❤
=
omg im emotional 😭😭💙💙
=
Now when I hear this. I can't help but think about 🍑  Be happy now. wherever you are. no more pain for you. Be the angel that you are.
=
개인적으로 이 무대가 제일 ,,, 여운이 남고 잘했던거 같음 ,,
=
Bom 😭❤
=
Rewatching the performance of our Bommie. This performance makes me/us cry. 😢😭💚
=
So painful to watch.  I can't. We love you bom.  We know2ne1 will have their own comeback not under yg i hope someone will produce it.
=
The last part was 😭
=
효정, 박봄 진짜 멋있다 이 노래를 엠넷에서 이상하게 인코딩한게 빡치네..후 박봄 진짜 마음아파ㅠ 박봄 버전도 듣고싶다
=
1:27 Woah, i didnt realize her hair was that long👀👀She beauty
=
Since Bom's comeback I really realized that she has such a weight in her voice. I quickly get emotional just listening to her. Just stunned by her effect.
=
im crying even i dont understand wht they are singing 😢
=
Can we have  a recording/studio version of this? I want to listen and stream this one. Pleaaaase! 🙏🙏🙏🙏
=
완벽히 같은 상황을 겪진 않겠지만 저 무대를 보고있는 다섯 그룹도 한번쯤은 다 겪을거라 상상해봤던, 다가올 미래란걸 알아서 공감대가 더 클지도....😭 좋은노래 해줘서 고마워요
=
Im crying too ... 💜 for Bom
=
Me hizo llorar, sin duda sus voces retratan sentimiento de soledad. Las amo ❤️
=
And the fact the BOM uses her 2ne1 mic 😭🥺
=
I’m not disappointed that this beautiful song was given to Lee Hai. Even if I would have to hear Bomi sing it entirely
=
If anyone is a fan of 2NE1, I'm sure one thing everyone will cry like me. My youth was associated with 2NE1, I never stopped loving them. When listening to this song, ParkBom and we all have the same feeling. Hopefully soon we will meet 2NE1 again. I love them very very much. Last night I cried a lot after watching this video !!!! Be strong, unie Bom, we will always love you and support you wholeheartedly 🤟🤟🤟🤟 We will always be BLACKJACK !!!! ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
=
하 진짜 2ne1원 한번 뭉쳐줬으면 좋겠다ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
Bom, you're an inspiration. Hyojung, you did so well. Thank you for a beautiful performance, girls. 💕
=
03:08 때 박봄 표정 뭐야 
귀엽ㅋㅋㅋ
=
나도 운댜 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜ 누워서 유튜브로 보는 나도 눈물이 나는데... 봄 언니 멋져요 잘 지내줘요 ㅠㅠ
=
진짜 보면서 눈물 났다 ....이게 진짜 마음을 울리는 무대가 아닐까 봄이언니 상황과 너무 잘 맞는다 효정이도 감정선 너무 잘 살려줬다 아 눈물나 ㅠㅠ
=
How is it supposed  that we are not crying with this? First Bom's microphone, her amazing performance, her voice and at the end she's crying.. 
I hope she's ok :(
=
this song make me cry even if i dont understand it
=
It breaks my heart.
It broke their heart.

Blackjacks, please keep on holding on.
=
her singing really touched me from the beginning... getting into the end I remembered all she went through ;_;
=
댓글 보니까 이 무대 립싱크 논란 있었나봄... 이거 절대 립싱크 아닌데. 그냥 아이돌 무대 계속보면 뭐가 립싱크고 라이브인지 알게 됨. 이건 라이브지... 이게 어케 립싱크야.
=
박봄은 진짜.. 목소리가 어쩜저래 단어 하나하나 슬퍼 ㅠㅠㅜ
=
Park bom❤️
=
Park Bom was right, you have to use your personal experience to really bring out an emotional performance.  And they really did a great job making me cry.💖
=
*The feels* :

*Bom- from 2ne1 to now*
*Hyojung- family problems*
=
엠넷 병1신아 립싱크인거처럼 편집하지마ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 들리는거만 봐도 라이브인거 다 아는데
=
Queen Bommie <3
=
it's breaking my heart 😭💔
please comeback 2NE1 ! 🙏🖤
=
Out of the 3 duos, Park Bom and Hyojung's performance is the only one that gave me chills.. Don't get me wrong, AA and 95 did an amazing performance but Bom&Jung sang with so much Emotions 😭❤
=
Oh my tears 😢
=
This song is for Park bom, She deserve a push, Blackjacks! Let’s support her! 2NE1 Vibe showing slowly! #2NE1
=
It’s so emotional!!! 💓😢
=
Speechless that all people do, when watch this performance. Wish they will win 😇
=
Park Bom ❤
=
iloveyou Bom <3
=
박봄 마지막에 울먹거리면서 대사 못 하는거 무대 완성도로 치면 좀 아쉬웠는데 감동은 더 배가 된거 같다..갑자기 울어서 깜짝 놀랐음 ㅠㅠ
=
내가 젤 조아하는 박봄💕💕평생 노래 부르면서 행복했음 좋겟어요😁
=
Bommie my Queen you are so stronger im so proud of you 😭❤️
=
Unnie, we love you. Please dont cry.😭
=
They say to me, “Why don’t you know -

That no matter what kind of love it is, it all changes after time passes”

They say that even after 1 year, things change from now

And that there won’t be any painful things then

But I know my heart very well

I know so well that it won’t change

Because everyone has a soul mate in this world

And that kind of love cannot be forgotten

 

You may think that I forgot about you

You may thing that I am happy with someone else

But I still can’t forget you like this

Like a scarecrow, who stands alone even after everyone leaves

 

After the sunsets and everyone goes home

I am standing alone in a wide field

Little by little, I can’t see ahead of me because of the darkness

It makes me more and more afraid of being alone but

When I opened my tightly shut eyes at some point

Beautiful stars were shining

Like the images of you, who left far away

As I looked at them, I prayed that you’ll come back to me some day

 

You may think that I forgot about you

You may thing that I am happy with someone else

But I still can’t forget you like this

Like a scarecrow, who stands alone even after everyone leaves

 

You may think that I forgot about you (oh, you may think that I)

You may thing that I am happy with someone else (forgot you)

But I still can’t forget you like this (I can’t forget)

Like a scarecrow, who stands alone even after everyone leaves

(Even if you leave me, I’m like a scarecrow)

 

Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself

=
박봄 조와해ㅠㅠㅠ 울지마 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ♥️
=
I cried for the fourth time i watched this Bommie fighting you deserve better
Hyojung did a great job and she's a good person too
I hope they win ♡
=
Like damn, i cried alright!!
=
PLEASEEEE MNET HAVE 2ne1 FOR A COMEBACK! 😭😭😭
=
박봄이 한 부르더니 한 풀었네.. 원래 허수아비 박봄꺼 였는데 yg에서 다른가수 줘서 당시에 캔슬됬었는데 이후 투애니원 데뷔->이하이 허수아비
양현석이 박진영한테 박봄 신곡좀 만들어달라 했고 마무리 다했던 곡인데 ㅠ
=
외로움+그리움+쓸쓸함 이 감정이 담겨있어서 다들 운듯.. 공감이 할 수 밖에 없는  감정이니까
그리고 박봄의 상황과 맞다아서 더 그러케 느낄 듯
=
omg I'm crying
=
This Mic....... Omg i go cry
=
That means a real ballad song😭
=
난 개인적으로 이 무대가 제일 좋았음 자신의 데뷔곡이 될 수 있던 노래를 드디어 이번에 무대에서 불러봤는데 옛날 생각도 나고 얼마나 감정이 북받칠까 처음부터 허수아비 부르고 싶다한거보면 얼마나 부르고 싶어한지도 알겠고
=
Queen and princess 💖
=
Park bom And Hyojung  , so beautiful!
=
Me rn:😭😭😭
=
봄아 울지마 😭😭😭😭
=
개인적으로 박봄 목소리는 진짜 맛있는 크림 파스타같은 기분. 맛있긴 진짜 맛있는데 느끼해서 많이 먹긴 벅찬 느낌이였는데 효정의 담백한 감정선이 섞여서 딱 적당히 듣기 좋은 무대였던 듯. 효정 파트가 조금더 많아도 좋았을 것 같은 아쉬움은 있음
=
Bom 😭😭😭
=
This was supposed to be her debut song...glad that you finally sing it unnie🤧🤧🤧
=
Shocks mu Queen Bom cried.😭
=
모든 걸 떠나서 이렇게 화면으로 떨어져서 보는 사람까지 먹먹하게 만든다는 건 정말 대단한 거..... 노래 듣고 운 건 손에 꼽는데 진짜.....
=
Bommie, uljimayo! 😭 Hyojung did a great job! I love Bom's new baby ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
Wtf I'm crying 😭😭😭😭
=
Oh my God! Why I cry. Huhu 😭😭😭
=
wth this performance brought me tears
=
"LIKE A SCARECROW, STANDING BY MY SELF" 
AND SHE'S HOLDING THAT GREEN MICROPHONE SHE USE WITH 2NE1. Its like a cryout to her member.. No matter what she never change and standing for her member. She always say that she missed 2ne1. Very sad.
=
iloveyou boom! Fighting!
=
Such a beautiful stage, I'm really happy to see Park Bom singing her song on TV ♥ I hope JYP can see this, I wonder what he thinks...

Also, HyoJung voice is beautiful too, she's my fav girl in OMG ♥


;-; The end had me crying <3
=
im still crying for this soooong huhu
=
저 초록색 마이크 얼마만에 보는거야..ㅠㅠ
=
미쳤다 진짜 이거 효정님버전 박봄님 버전 음원 내줬으면 좋겠다 진짜 둘다 내취향인데 한번 풀로 따로 부르는거 듣고싶어 울고싶을때 들으면 ㄹㅇ 펑펑 울듯 진짜...와 ...박봄언니 우는거 마음 아프잖아...
=
bom i know you can sing it live... So,..
=
I love this duo, they’re so uWu 🥰🥰🥰
=
When I listen this song I’m feeling 2ne1 still on stage
=
fighting park bom ,, love you
=
Park bom ❤
=
Bomieeeeee! It's fineeee, we know you're strooong! Fighting!
=
박봄 너 때메 또 운다..ㅠㅠ
=
봄미, 사랑해! You did well, Queen!
=
다른 보컬유닛분들도 훌륭하셨지만
개인적으로는 봄앤쩡 무대가 젤로 좋았다는...
마음을 울리고 여운도 많이 남는 무대였어요
무대 내내 들으면서계속 울음 참다가
박봄씨 울 때 같이 터져벌임 ㅠ
=
진짜 수십번 돌려봐도 눈물나네... 뒤늦게 밤봄 팬됨 . 퀸덤 중에서 이날이 제일 이뻤음
=
봄언니 자존감 너무 낮아지신게 눈에 보인다 너무 맘아파 ㅜ
=
Because of all the journey of being a kpop idol of park bom she thinks a lot and the song it was emotional i cry a lot and  i feel sad when park bom an the end was cry am sure all of you was feeling that way good job  to the both of you 😭😭😭😭😭😭💔
=
¿Qué pasó con el ejército Bomiee? XD
A seguir reproduciendo y disfrutar de tan maravillosa presentación.
Mucho amor para ti Bom. ❤️👑
=
She’s been alone since the show started, ever since her scandal.. and the lyrics are really hitting her hard, she has to sing the words so she can’t make herself think of something else to not cry ..
=
We love u bommie🙂our queen👸🏻
=
solar said: i felt that.




but anyways, this just made me really said, yknow i thought they were genuinely putting emotion into it i didn't see the crying part coming though
this was just, sad.
it wrecked my heart heLp
=
이 노래는 들을 때 마다 눈물이나ㅜㅜ
=
Thank you JY Park Pd-nim to give this song to bom although in the end this song was given bom to le hii because she had to debut at 2ne1
=
진짜 효정이 대박적...밝은 곡도 잔잔한 곡도 소화 잘한다
=
Maybe I played this hundred times! 😂
Such a very very very great rendition and collab ! ❤❤❤
=
박봄나올때 미미 진짜 아련하네.
=
Bom we love you<3
=
Don’t cry our pretty queen😢💕💖
=
분명 완벽한무대도 아닌데 왤캐 맘이가지? 몇번을 보는지 모르겠다... 진심이 느껴진달까 뭉클하네 오히려 박봄이 끝에 울먹이면서 허수아비...처럼... 하고 흐리는게 제일 좋다 ㅜㅜ
=
Park bom, como sempre maravilhosa, com uma voz incrível  e muito potência.
=
Why am i sad?  Crying when Boom sang her part.  😢😢
=
진짜 목소리가 위로된다...
=
We love you bom 😭❤️❤️
=
Hyojung is really a good vocalist. I hope Bom gets more votes. I felt sad that she cried during the performance
=
We're here (Blackjacks) forever supporting you and other members🔥❤ Always slaying every performance😭
=
혼자 서있는 허수아비 같다는 가사에 저도 가슴이 후벼파네요 ㅠㅠ 투에니원 재결성 !!! 컴백!!! ㅠㅠ 컴밲!!!!
=
I still cry even after i heard this multiple time a days 😢😭😢
=
Park bom❤️😢
=
중간점검 땐 박봄 성량이 효정이에 비해 너무 세게 나가는 느낌이 있었는데 무대할 땐 둘이 어느 정도 균형 잘 맞는 거 같다 ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 뽐쩡 최고다 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I really love the reaction of moonbyul when bom started singing😳😌
=
stay strong Bommie 💗 You’re not alone anymore
=
봄이 언니 첫 소절부터 불안하다 했었는데ㅠㅠ 허수아비 딱 듣자마자 나도 2ne1 생각나서 먹먹했는데 언니는 얼마나 더 가사 하나하나가 와닿았을지ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I love you!!! Be strong our dearest Bom! Blackjacks are here for you 💕😭 Be strong ya'll 💕
=
처음에 효정이 가사 전달이 잘되게 부르고 싶다고 말했었는데 제대로 성공한듯 둘이 부르는 거 감정이입이 너무 잘된다....너무 좋다 진짜ㅜㅜㅠ 특히 마지막에 박봄이 울면서 부를때 나도 같이 울컥함.....ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜ
=
진짜 FIRE 데뷔 때 부터 진짜 너무너무 좋아했던 언닌데,
예쁘고 예뻤던 그 시절을 그리워 해서 흘리는 눈물 같아서
같이 울고 말았어요, 언니 아직 블랙잭은 죽지 않았어요..
영원히 2NE1그리고 박봄을 응원할게요, 그러니까 울지말고 힘내요 사랑해요.
언제가 될 진 모르지만 꼭 제 댓글을 보고 힘냈으면 좋겠어요.


2NE1 and Black Jack are together forever.
=
well, i'm a hard fan of Park Bom since i was child
=
Bom, we love you so much❤❤
=
FIGHTING... I really like their duet. Sweet voice + powerful voice. 👍
=
Both BOM and HYOJUNG had a hard past from hyojung loosing her father at a young age and fighting to debut to BOM loosing her best friend right infront of her eyes to being hated by kneitz bcoz of the anxiety bills she had to take stan Strong women
=
10년넘게 지켜본 블랙잭으로써 눈물 펑펑 울었어요 진짜 봄 언니 사랑해요 세상이 아무리 돌을 던져도 우리가 언니편이 되어줄게요 사랑해 ㅠㅠㅠ뽐
=
BOM MY QUEEN ♡♡
=
박봄 우는 거 너무 슬프다 진짜 너무 잘 불렀고 앞으로도 응원해요~!
=
bom :'(
=
박봄 저 특유의 발음이 감정을 극대화하는거같음
=
본방보다가 진짜ㅜㅜㅜ처음부터 레전드공연
=
i just came to watch but

why are my tears falling?
=
박봄머리 겁나 기네ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Hyojung is so good 🥺
=
If Bom had moved anyone to tears with this ballad, she's more than a singer,  she's a soul healer.  This duet is the champion in  my eyes, ears and heart....🙌
=
i hope there is a english sub for this
=
#ParkBom!!😍😍💖💖 i love your voice so beautiful! Are you beauriful and handsome !!
Nooo park bom se puso a llorar 😭💔 pobre mi bom :"(
=
박봄 소울 미쳤다😭😭
=
Y’know what .. no matter how much evil edits or any toxicity to create a feud between such great artists, these ladies are true genuine artists who appreciate the form of art they all share and the uniqueness they have individually.. all of these women are such stans and true artists it’s just beautiful.. this whole program has made me fan of all these groups and artists.. it’s crazy. It’s because they’re talented and the competition is healthy. It’s just beautiful.. THEY REALLY SHAPED THE NAME QUEENDOM ✨✨🥺🥺💕💞💖
=
Koreans you should be proud of Bom. She has one of the most unique voice on this world (not only in kpop). Please support our Queen 💕
=
퀸덤에서 박봄이 부른 다른 곡들보다 이 무대를 보니 유난히 퀸덤의 모든게 벌써 그립다. 
오마이걸, AOA, 마마무, 러블리즈, 여자아이들 모두가 다
=
i love you ParkBom i beside you forever. God bless you ^^
=
봄아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
나도 우러 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 박봄 너무 슬퍼 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 박봄이 왜 처음부터 그렇게 이 노래를 부르고싶어했는지 가사 들으니 알겠네 ㅠㅠ 어우 슬퍼 ㅠ
=
투애니원 다떠나고 혼자 남은 박봄노래같냐ㅠ 진짜 너무 슬프다
=
그냥 음색 지렸음
봄이  화이팅입니다
=
진짜 처음 들을때는 이상했는데 들으면 들을수록 좋은게 매력인듯!
=
박봄 목소리 듣자마자 소름끼치네ㄷㄷ
=
Overflowing tears :-( Bom!
=
Ah the goosebumps, she is so nervous tho 
This Queen must be protected at all cost !
=
박봄 사랑해 항상 네편이야 울지마
=
효정이 뮤지컬 하는 것 같이 너무 잘해ㅜㅜ
=
Aww Bommie 😢
=
솔직히 노래만 보면 아쉽고 준비한거만큼 못 부른 거같긴한데 둘다 감정 전달은 좋았던것같다 내가 좀 울컥함..
=
정말 오마이걸 활동에서도 노래 많이 하지만 퀸덤에서 효정 언니의 음색을 자주 들을 수 있다는 게 너무 좋다 언니 솔로곡도 내 주셨으면 좋겠고 마지막에 박봄 님 우시는 게 너무 마음이 아팠다... 다들 꽃길만 걸어요
=
You've worked hard Bom♡
=
I felt that.. Can't understand it but I've felt it, straight to the heart.. #2ne1 #ohmygirl good job!
=
둘 다 목소리 너무 좋음! 생각보다 잘 어울려서 놀랐음. 눈물나도록 감동적인 무대.. 근데 효정이의 큰 숨소리가 너무 자주 들려서 아쉬움...ㅜㅜ
=
이 보컬 팀 들을때가 제일 감정이입이 잘 되는거 같고 가장 아름다운거같음
=
Yeah keep on streaming guys
=
Stay strong dear park bom 🌸
=
+Bom singing+🎶
My reaction while watching her 1:36 . 
I can feel her strong emotion and her loneliness. My god
=
Me: NO CLUE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING
Also me: crying like there is no tommorow
=
the mic :( loveyouuuu park bom
=
박봄 목소리만 들으면 왜이리 슬퍼지지 ㅠㅠ
=
I know that her feel. Bom, you such a strong woman! Stay healthy and cheering up uri Bomie! You really did well!
=
sesek bgt dada gw 😭😭😭
=
박봄은 진짜.. 부르자마자 소름돋고 눈물 날 것 같다 ㅠㅠ
=
난..효정이 음색 감정때문에 슬펐는데
개인적으로 박봄..스타일은 호불이라서 ㅜ
근데 마지막 우는모습보고 
너무 슬펐다ㅜ
=
Please don't be sad my QUEEN BOM 😭😭😭😭😭
=
Bom and Jong not just singing, they telling a story through the microphone 🎤 I felt how sadness even I closes my eyes.
=
I’m not crying, you are 🥺
=
이 프로그램 볼때마다 박봄도 솔로가 아니라 2ne1이라는 팀으로 출연했으면 어땠을까..생각하게 된다
=
I cried ,  before understand the lyrics ........ :'(
=
tanta emoção, elas foram perfeitas!
=
수고했어요 봄이온뉘 ㅠㅠ 😭😭😭😭사랑해 🥰🥰🥰🥰
=
Watch this over 20 times but still crying. Bom is another level.
=
Win or lose, this performance is pure and raw emotions. It’s such a phenomenal performances from Hyojung and Park Bom.
=
Love Park Bom 💗
=
Why I'm cried watching this part of song Park Bom? It's very sad song.. I feel it what Queen through feeling. 😔😭 2NE1 always the Legendary for Girl Group Pop Korean. 🙏😩😘
=
Dont know why but im crying
=
Park boom más preciosa 💕💕💕
=
봄님 퀸덤 무대마다 뭔가 절절한게ㅜㅠㅠㅜㅜㅠ다른 팀은 팀으로 나오는데 혼자 솔로인거 많이 느끼는거 같아서 안쓰럽고..ㅜㅠ저번에 파이어때도 다라 보여주고 싶다고 그런거 보면 시청자분들 말처럼 씨엘님이랑 한번했다간 진짜 펑펑쏟으실거 같아ㅜㅠㅜ
=
노래부르는 둘의 마음이 너무 잘 전달 되는 무대였습니다..그냥 다들 즐겁게지내거  밝게보여도 남들이 모르는 아픔과 외로움 하나씩 있기에 공감하고 눈물이났습니다.
좋은 무대 감사합니다
=
that's the SAME green mike Bom used when 2ne1 was all together... ;(
=
bommie's voice is so raw full of emotions. i suddenly feel so sad right now and i dont even know the  menaing of their song. my gawd shes an impact. fighting bom. dont give up. let your voice be heard. i wish she could gain friends thru this competition. its sad how idol sometimes feel so alone and depress esp with what she had gone thru im sorry im not a good fan bommie im sorry. il support you better i promise. ❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️❤️♥️
=
Although i didn't understand the meaning, my tears are falling down, this song is so sad. Bom&Jung are the best❤️
=
박봄이 목소리가떨리고 발음이 먹힌게 프로답지 못하다고 느껴지는건 당연할수있음 근데 음원이아닌 라이브로 감정을 전달해야하는 이 무대에서 박봄의 감정이 저렇게 우리에게 전달이 됐기때문에 이 무대가 더 몰입도있다고 생각함
=
FIGHTING UNNI!!! PARK BOM! PARK BOM! PARK BOM!
=
Queen Park Bom💚💚💚💚
=
SHE DESERVE SONG OF THE YEAR!!! KEEP VOTING OUR BOMMIE DEAREST BOMBSHELL AND BLACKJACK!!! MAKE OUR CANDY PROUD!!!
=
hello mnet, can yoy release a clear audio version of thisss!!
=
I think dara, cl and minzy probably would cry when seeing this performance
=
난 박봄의 팬이 전혀 아닌데 왜 이렇게 눈물이 줄줄 나지? 이상하당께...
=
BOM voice make me cry, whyy? Even i dont understand what song it is about.
=
박봄 발음이고 뭐고간에 음색자체가 마음을 울림 ㅜㅜ 진짜 가수다.. 물론 효정도 잘함!
=
So emotional 😭😭😭😭
=
듣고 진짜 울었다.. 효정이랑 봄이 감정이 너무나 잘 와닿아서.. ㅠㅠ 그동안 색안경 끼고 박봄을 솔직히 좋아하지 않았지만 외롭고 고생한게 다 느껴져서 감정이입도 하고.. 뭐라 해야할지 모르겠네 그냥 너네 무대 보고 울었고 봄아 그동안 색안경 끼고 좋지 않게 봐서 미안해ㅠㅠ 효정이도 우리 리더 고생많았어!ㅠㅠ 미라클이 더 많은 사랑 줄게 쩡언니ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
We love you, Bom!
=
BOMMIE 👑❤
=
I'm still crying for this song huhuhu😥😥😥
=
OK they both did great very emotional performance.. Until now I'm still crying even though I watch it many times..
=
I'm crying truely😭💔
=
들을 수록 명품. Soul music 보컬 테크닉 중 특히 twirling 과 auxiliary sound technique은 우리나라에서는 볼 수 없는 수준의 월드클래스임.
이렇게 노래를 불러주다니 감격이고 감동!! 퀸덤에서 박봄이 부른 모든 노래 중 이 노래가 음원으로써의 가치가 가장 높다고 생각하는데  ㅠ ㅠ
=
Love you 😍 don’t cry
=
nOoo don't cry😭 I'll support you BOMi❤
=
효정이 뮤지컬해도 너무 잘하겠다ㅜ 목소리가 어떻게 저리 예쁜지... 박봄 목소리 너무 슬프지만 감동적 ... 개인적으로 이 무대가 제일 좋았음 ㅜㅜ
=
reading comments made me cry even more :((
=
효정이  너무 좋아~♥..♥
=
노래 넘 좋아♡
=
1:32 투애니원이였던 시절한테 하는 소리 같다..
=
보컬 유닛중에 이노래가 개인적으로 제일 좋다 진짜ㅜㅜㅜ 
힐링되기도 하고 슬프기도 하고ㅠㅠ 효정온니 진짜 노래 정말 잘한다... 오마이걸 대박나자!!!
=
I dont undesrtand a single word but I feel so sad .. what's goin on boomie ?? 😭 I miss them so much 💔💔
=
Yung feeling ng "Ako na lang mag isa , masakit pero sobrang miss ko na kayung kasama" 

my 2ne1 heart is breaking
=
the way that all the idols looked when they were watching made this video even more emotional for me. usually their reactions are more intense but everyone was breathtaken and on the verge of tears. you can tell that they really respect her and everything that she’s gone through... we love you park bom!!
=
I love queens♡
=
1:13 이부분 박봄이 투에니원 멤버들에게 하는이야기같다..
솔직히 퀸덤 보면서 박봄너무 쓸쓸해보이긴했었음..
말할사람도없고 다른아이돌들은 자기 그룹찾을때
박봄은 찾을사람도없고...내가 옆에있고싶다아유
=
I'm always happy to always read that most of the comment section are about my queen parkbom...😍😍
=
this is so sad..im crying i miss 2ne1 i miss blackjack..miss you dara..miss you bom..miss you cl..miss you minzy..
=
박봄❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ 이쁘다! 멋지다! 울지마요~~ 행복하기만 하쟈 ! ! 박봄님 화이팅 !❤️
=
Legend never die 2NE1 BOM ❤️ Thanks hyo jung for go to bom❤️
=
진짜 박봄이 솔로로 데뷔하기 전에 준비했던거라 그런가 완전 애절해 ㅠㅠ..
=
I keep watching, i keep crying. I miss 2ne1
=
저 초록색 마이크도 뭔가 감동... 투애니원 때 쓰던 마이크 색 아닌가요ㅜㅜ

이 무대는 최고 그 이상이다 하ㅜㅜㅜ
=
투애니원 보고싶다 어떡해 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 언니 울지마요
=
CRY ... BOM LOVE YOU
=
퀸덤보면서 생각한건데 다른 투애니원 멤버들도 대단하다는 생각듬. 박봄 목소리가 워낙 특이하고 섞이기 힘든데 투애니원 노래들을때는 멤버들이랑 너무 잘어울리고 다들 특색있어서 튄다는 느낌없고. 다같이또한무대에서 노래부를날이 올까
=
Gak tau artinya tapi pas bom nyanyi, langsung netes ni air mata 😭😭
=
i loviuuuuu Bomieee! <3
=
I love you Bom, You are so strong for facing all of this hates!!!
=
I feel so sad. 😔
=
저기 서서 저 노래를 부르는 박봄의 심정이 이해가 가서 슬프네요ㅠㅠㅠ 무대위에서 4명 다같이 노래할 수 있는 날이 언젠가는 올거라구 믿어요
=
Omg 😭😭😭
=
My boomie 😭😭😭
=
왜 짠하지.. ㅜㅜ 힘내요 ♡
=
park bom 😍😭
=
그냥 양씨가 ㅈㄴ 찌끄레기다 니가 모든 일의 원흉이다 퉤니원 돌려내 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Awww our Bomie, don't cry bb :((
=
So this is gift song from park Jinyoung (JYP) for bom's
=
Bom😍
=
봄 울지마ㅠㅠ
=
I just want Bom to sing in MAMA 2019 as a R&B soloist. Black R&B is what she has been pursuing for long from her very early career.
=
박봄효정 너무좋고...ㅜㅜㅜ개인적으로 난 듀엣중에서 이무대가 1위라고생각함.. 근데 퀸덤은 아무래도 팬덤영향이크다보니까 쫌 걱정된다..ㅜㅜ 둘다 팬덤 작다보니까.. 제발 1등해라 봄쩡팀
=
only Park Bom can look amazing in hair that long 
Rapunzel who?? i only know Bom
=
먼가 박봄이랑 효정이 둘 다 노래 잘부르고 최고긴 한데 목소리 둘이 안 어우러지는 느낌..? 이질감이 너무 큰 느낌
=
YG에 있을때 도대체 무슨일이 있었던거야
=
무대에서 가사에, 노래에 공감하고 취해 눈물을 보이는 그게 진짜 프로 아닐까요 그정도로 이 노래에 감정을 실었다는거니까요 진짜 감정을 잘 전달하는거같아요
=
BOOMIE </3
=
Hyojung!!! Bommie!!!
=
OMG IAM CRY, BOM SHE THE BEST SINGERS AT KOREA , i hope one day Bom have project with DAVICHI
=
박봄 목소리 소름돋아...좋습니다👍
=
박봄 목소리 딱 나오는데 그냥 눈물이 ㅠㅠ...
=
Can we get this on spotify. Pleaseeeeee mnet
=
너무 슬퍼 ㅠㅠ 허수아비 부르는 박봄님 심정이 어떨까 .. 힘내세요 ㅠ
=
The first video upload of this was raw and emotional.  Park Bom cried and walked out after the performance because she was crying. It was too hard to watch her cry like that. Hope she can feel that she is loved by many people and supports her all the way. Stay strong Park Bom.💖
=
Damn Bom’s voice really is like no other, truly one of a kind. She Deserves to Rank 1st this time...
=
this was so beautiful q-q
=
this is beautiful
=
Thank you Bom, for being a strong woman.
=
Our crying been t caring Queen park bom weloveyou
=
만약 진짜 만약.. 투애니원이 파이널무대에 나온다면.... 꿈일거같다.. 꿈은 이루어질수 없는거니까..
=
park bom is perfect
=
BOM 😭💕
=
appreciation for hyojung’s clear voice
=
이 영상은 마지막 박봄 울음터질때마다 같이 울게되네 그동안 얼마나 힘들었고 그리웠으면
=
Idk if Bommie crying literally for her previous love life or career.. but looking at her journey in singing and as 2NE1 tbh, its break my heart imagining the whole things.. from separating to unable release this song as her version..
=
Park Bom! Fighting! Never give up!
=
뽀미언니 목소리들으면서 기운내요!!!
보이스가 정말 너무 좋아요 ♡
악플따위 신경쓰지마요 !!!!!!!!!!!!
=
박봄씨가 노래 부르자마자 눈물이 나왔어요 가사가 정말 잘 전달됐고 뭔가 모르게 슬프고 위로도 됐어요. 박봄씨와 효정씨 무대 잘 봤어요 언제나 응원해요 화이팅💕💕
=
my 2ne1heart 😭🖤🖤🖤🖤 bomie..

=
Park Bom Sendo Maravilhosa como sempre
=
She's using her mic...😭😭😭
=
Woy sapa yg taro bawang disini😭
=
봄 언니... 명불허전이다..... 노래가 울고 있어요ㅠㅠ
=
Sulli links me to Bom. She been through lots of. Plz dun hate her!! Love her more!! Why lots of hater out there??? Omg i dun wanna do anything today after reading bad news abt Sulli!!!
=
Crying knowing the lyrics

They say to me, "Why don't you know –
That no matter what kind of love it is, it all changes after time passes"
They say that even after 1 year, things change from now
And that there won't be any painful things then
But I know my heart very well
I know so well that it won't change
Because everyone has a soul mate in this world
And that kind of love cannot be forgotten
You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can't forget you like this
I stand alone even after everyone leaves,
Like a scarecrow

After the sun sets and everyone goes home
I am standing alone in a wide field
Little by little, I can't see ahead of me because of the darkness
It makes me more and more afraid of being alone but
When I opened my tightly shut eyes at some point
Beautiful stars were shining
Like the images of you, who left far away
As I looked at them, I prayed that you'll come back to me some day

You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can't forget you like this
I stand alone even after everyone leaves
Like a scarecrow

You may think that I forgot about you
(Oh, you may think that I)
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
(Forgot you)
But I still can't forget you like this
(I can't forget)
I stand alone even after everyone leaves
Like a scarecrow
(Even if you leave me, I'm like a scarecrow)

Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself
=
이곡을 박진영이 그냥 박봄에게 준게 아니네요 이렇게 부르는 걸 상상하며 만든 노래
=
Bommie please don't cry ~~ I MISS 2NE1 SOOOOO MUCH
=
1:40 초부터 발음 웨그러는겨 봄 .. 외국인 다돼아써....
=
효정이도 목소리며 감정이고 나무랄게 없이 잘했고 그덕에 봄이의 노래의 감정이 더 와 닿은듯...울음 꾹 참고 부르느라...ㅠㅠ같이 울었음ㅠ
=
Park bom still use green mic😢
=
oh my god she cried i cried everyone was shocked
=
아 눈물나네 얼마나 외롭고 힘들었을지 그게 고스란히 느껴지네 ...
=
I'm not crying.. i'm not 😭😭😭😭😭
=
효정이가 옴스티니 회의 때 발라드 하고 싶어하는 이유가 있었어ㅜㅡㅜ 발라드 장인이야 장인..개인적으로 중간점검 때는 살짝 아쉬웠는데 잘 뽑혔네요. Fire 때처럼 음원이 안나올거라는게 원통하다ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
이번무대 레전드...ㄷㄷ
=
오마이갓 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 눈물샘 ..폭발 ㅠ
=
박봄 너무 예쁜데?
=
사랑합니다~~^^♡
=
울음 참으면서 무대 한 거 같다 결국 마지막에 터진 거고
=
진짜 혼자 서있는 허수아비 같다..
멤버들없이 혼자 무대에 섰고 당당한 그녀의 모습을 응원합니다
=
너무 슬퍼서 눈물이 나오네요. 힘들어 하지말아요  늘응원 할께요"박봄 화이팅!!
=
Vote Park Bom at Mama 2019 as Best Vocal Performance Solo.
=
1:24 solar’s face is a mood
=
Tough for her as she is alone competing against girls group.
=
얼마나 힘들었을까, 순진하고 순수했었는데. 너무 갑자기 돌을 맞아버리니까 너무 힘들었겠지.. 가사도 진짜 너무 봄 상황이라 ..  언니 세상이랑은 우리가 싸울게 언니는 예쁜 것만 보고 있어.




그리고 양발놈아 너는 진짜 평생 발뻗고 잘 생각 하지마 진짜 죄책감에 하루하루 시달렸음 좋겠다
=
Her mic ㅠㅠ
=
😭😭😭#BomPark❤❤❤
=
When will the studio version release?
=
I cried even though i didn’t even understand a single word they sang.
=
I hope CL and minzy watch his performance....
=
ㅠㅠ아니 박봄파트때 왜 싱크 안맞지....저번에도 그렇구...암넷 편집 제대로해줘요
=
봄이 언니 사랑해요 언제나 응원해요🖤
=
가사 하나하나가 마음에 남았을 거 같음 ㅜㅜ 쉽 잘 우는 사람이 아닌데 눈물이 나네
=
뭔가 드라마틱한 전개는 없었지만, 봄앤쩡이 모두 담백하게 무대를 장식했기에 더 감동이 와닿은 무대.. 봄이언니 울지마요♡
=
진심이 느껴졋던 노래~ 잘 듣고 갑니다~ 멋진 무대엿어요~1등하면 좋켓네요~♡
=
다라 봄 쌍박조합 새로은 론리 버전 많이 들어주세요ㅜ 다라 유튜브가면 있습니다

😭😭😭bless park bom
=
That green Mic. 💚
=
while others tryna look cool or focus on their vocals while singing ballad here's bom showing them all a real ballad song? it's emotions
=
진짜 개미쳤다... 쩡이언니의 옥구슬같은 음색과 박봄님의 넘사벽 음색이 만나면 이렇게 되는구나...
쩡이언니 음색 더 듣고싶은 분 복면가왕에서 부른 희재 꼭 들어보세요 👍👍👍👍
=
봄아 사랑해
=
and I got carried away too! 😢😢😢😭😭😭😭
=
Guys share this!!!❤ please
=
박봄 고맙고 사랑합니다
=
Just the fact that in this performance she finished with her head down in comparison to the other performances broke me
=
Look at Bom’s mic🥺 she use 2ne1 mic❤️
=
모두가 떠나가도 혼자 서있는 허수아비처럼...
=
와 박봄 왜이리 이뻐 미쳤다

봄이누나가 퀸덤 디집어놨다ㅠㅠ
=
Thank you MNet for bringing our Bom back
=
나도 울었다••눈물나옴
=
진심으로 박수를 보냅니다
=
I miss 2ne1..😢😭
=
이쯤되면 암넷 작정하고 일 그지같이하는거아닌지 합리적 의심이 들기 시작한다ㄷㄷ
=
this is so sad why mnet make all my queens compete with each other whyy
=
멜로디.가사 넘 서글푸다. ㅜㅜ
=
세번째 보고있는데 세번다 눈물이 나오네요 ㅎㅎ
=
이거 음원 안나오나요 ...?? ㅜㅁㅜ
=
지금까지 그런 소속사에서 버티느라 얼마나 힘들었을까ㅠㅠ 제발 앞으로는 행복했으면 좋겠어요😭 이 노래에서 모든 감정이 폭발한 느낌이야ㅠ
=
다른 무대 한번씩 다봤는데 그중에서도 다시찾아서 보려고 온거는 이거뿐 였어ㅠㅠㅠ
=
어흑ㅠㅠ
=
Im crying. ㅠㅠ
=
와 역시 박봄 음색.
=
i expect more harmonization, but then bom singing style is really hard to be harmonized with.
=
im happy that she use green mic, like she used to before. i hope she will keep using it.. as a source of strength for her on stage. i will always remember park bom is part of the greatest girlgroup i ever stanned!
ps; i love her hair.
=
왜 다 박봄얘기만....우리 효정이 너무 잘했어...
=
눈물 줄줄 효정이 목소리도 이렇게 예뻤구나,, 봄언니 말이 필요하나요,,,❤️
=
I didnt understand the lyrics but when bOm sing i feel sad. . .
=
박봄 예전엔 이정도 아니었는데 조금 듣기힘든 느낌..울림이랑 목소리 다 좋은데 뭔가 꿩꿩을 꾸.웡, 꾸.웡- 하는 느낌이라... 효정이라도 안어울리고..
=
이걸 들으려 몇번이나 다시 들어오는지 모르겠네ㅠㅠㅠ
=
언니 울어도돼요 너무 고생 많았죠 힘들었죠 앞으로 우리 꽃길만 걸어요 행복해줘요
=
bomaaaaa 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
진짜 효정도입부 지렸고 박봄 음색 그자체로 예술이였던 무대 ㅠㅠㅠ
음원내줘요 ㅠㅠ
이하이 와이지님들 부탁합니다 ㅜㅜ
=
음원안나오나여..ㅠㅠ
=
전 박봄이 젤 좋아요♡♡ 
실력이 음색 ♡
=
I guest On 3:36 park bom hold her tears😥😥 it should be adlib maybe
=
you can totally see how bom misses 2ne1 and performing on stage on this show. im not a fan but im hoping 2ne1 to perform together once again.  she deserves all the love
=
이쯤하면됐다... 마지막 박봄 눈물은 2NE1이랑 블랙잭 소집령이라 봐도 무방할듯... ㅜㅜ 2NE1 재결성하자ㅜㅜ
=
Song's meaning :-

They say to me, "Why don't you know –
That no matter what kind of love it is, it all changes after time passes"
They say that even after 1 year, things change from now
And that there won't be any painful things then
But I know my heart very well
I know so well that it won't change
Because everyone has a soul mate in this world
And that kind of love cannot be forgotten
You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can't forget you like this
I stand alone even after everyone leaves,
Like a scarecrow

After the sun sets and everyone goes home
I am standing alone in a wide field
Little by little, I can't see ahead of me because of the darkness
It makes me more and more afraid of being alone but
When I opened my tightly shut eyes at some point
Beautiful stars were shining
Like the images of you, who left far away
As I looked at them, I prayed that you'll come back to me some day

You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can't forget you like this
I stand alone even after everyone leaves
Like a scarecrow

You may think that I forgot about you
(Oh, you may think that I)
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
(Forgot you)
But I still can't forget you like this
(I can't forget)
I stand alone even after everyone leaves
Like a scarecrow
(Even if you leave me, I'm like a scarecrow)

Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself

-(no wonder she cried...😭😭😭 unfair treatment and no justice)-
=
I hope 2ne1 will comeback rock the stages..
=
박봄은 호소력이 왤케 좋지? 신기하네..뭔가 몰입시키는 힘이 있는듯
=
Oh gods this made me cry. 😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
I started crying when Bom started singing. Why is this so sad tho.
=
나만 그렇게 느끼나.. 약간 유닛무대가 아니고 박봄의 무대인데 효정이 깜짝 등장해서 노래해주는 느낌.. 기분탓인가
=
I remember when back in 2011 Leehi released Scarecrow, I heard this was supposed to be Bom’s song and JYP gifted to her. I was very curious about her version and I’m happy I got to hear her sing this song again rather than that leaked version from BIGBANG’s concert in 2007. Imagine the special memories, all hopes and dreams she held as a young girl with this song. No wonder she cried.
=
봄 울때 진짜 마음아파... 퉤니원 꼭 뭉쳐줘
=
UGHHHHH BOM I JUST WANNA HUG YOU QUEEN
=
I hope someone hugged and comforted Bommie after their performance 😢 We love you Bom!!!!
=
박봄과 효정의 노래가 감동적이다
=
I don’t understand what they sing
But when bommi sings, I cried
I feel sad
When the last word she sings, I feel bad
Why she cry?! 
I am blackjack
Stand by you forever park bom
=
😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤
=
I got momentarily shocked coz @2:52 i got the same reaction as Solar
=
아 왜 눈물이 서럽게 나냐ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 나도 혼자다니고 학교에서 아싸이고 친구들이랑 손절해서 혼자인데 박봄님 진짜 외롭고 힘든 같은 처지인게 맘에 잘와닿아서 서럽게 눈물이 터졌어요ㅠㅠ 이번에 1등 꼭 하시길 왜 허수아비 하고싶으신이유를 알았어요ㅜㅜㅜ
=
Thank you HYONJUNG for choosing our Park Bom ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
슬픈데 슬픔이 전해져서 좋다.
=
I love Bom so much !!!!
=
Park Bom my Queen  😭😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩❣❣❣❣❣
=
Standing on this stage and singing this song I totally feel bom’s pain.
=
진짜 보다가 울었다 너무 이해가 된다
살다가 혼자라고 생각될때 너무 힘들때
참고 괜찮은척 하면서 지내는데
이노래는 그 기분을 잘 알아주는 느낌이다
새벽에 다시보기로 봤는데 혼자 봐서
그런지 더 울컥했음
이 글을 보는 분들 모두 행복하셨으면 좋겠습니다.
모두 하시는일들이 잘되길 응원합니다~~~~!!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
신곡 "봄" 도 애잔한데  이곡은 정말 슬프네요! ㅠㅠ
=
박봄 언너! 울지마!!
=
You did well Bom Eonnie
=
팬분이 무슨 마음으로 투애니원 응원봉을 흔드셨을지....ㅜ
=
뽐언니 자기파트 시작부터 계속 울컥했다고... 발음이 계속 뭉개졌단말임 아 우리 뽐언니ㅠㅜㅠ
=
ㅜㅜ..ㅜㅜ..
=
Slay Queen 👑 Park Bom 💚
=
ㅠㅠ...
=
Hyojung's father past away when she was studying in class 5 she did so many part time jobs on restaurants and once she tries to go to mountain and help her grandmother on her works to make some money but that doesn't work
Also which is most heartbreaking  : in her family she ,her mother  and her sister 
3 girl in family no man ..😔
=
Bom's microphone 💚💚💚😭😭😭
=
Continuem lindas.Como a letra mesmo fala, firmes mesmo quando estiverem sozinhas, Boom, imagino que seu suspiro no final foi de algo que machucou e ainda machuca muito, mas saiba que mesmo não lendo , seus fãs lhe manda energias positivas e pede que não desista de seus sonhos, o mundo precisa de mensagens positivas e vai a minha <3
=
ㅜㅜ
=
쪼잔하게마이크도 못가져가게하냐 양싸인성더럽네
=
Park Bom holding her legendary green mic. 💚
=
I knew YG for almost 10 years. It's not a long time, but I was great with me because I saw the legend: 2NE1,BIGBANG, PSY, Seven,Lee Hi, AKMU,WINNER,iKON... shone. Their talents can't find anywhere, any company. Now, the next generation is working wonderful with their basis from their previous generation. Still YG for one love. 
Hope to see their reunion!
=
저도 노래하는거  보면서 울컥했어요~ 마음을 울리는 노래같아요!  여러번 듣게 되네요~
=
인트로 박봄 머리 허벅지까지 내려온거 보고 잘못봤나 ?하고들어왔다
=
마음 아파서 못 보겠어 ㅜㅜ
=
둘이 음색 진짜 다른데 하모니 오진다...
=
I was really trying not to cry when bom started singing but no.......    *my eyes are sweating too much*
=
박봄얘기밖에없어서ㅠㅠ 남겨봅니다
효정이도 잘했어요😄 화이팅
=
효정에게서 이선희씨의 느낌이 나요.
=
무무인데 박봄선배님 입덕하려하고있었음.. 아빠가 2ne1 엄청 좋아하시는데 나도 영향 엄청 많이 받은듯.. 이 무대가 진짜 확실히 입덕시켰다. 박봄님 혼자 대기실에서 가만히 말도 많이 안하시는것보고 되게 기분 이상했는데 가사 하나하나 다 박봄선배님 감정을 더 강하게 하는 것 같아서 눈물 핑 돌았다.. 언니 제가 아직 13살인데요 제가 운전면허따서 혼자 차 몰고 언니 무대 보러갈 수 있을 때까지 가수해주세요....ㅜㅜㅜ
=
박봄 목소리 그냥 대박이라는 말밖에.... 효정도 너무 잘부르고...
=
I requested 2ne1 to be back and this show ☹️
=
Why I crying 😩
=
그보다 박봄 머리 진짜 길다
=
눈물나 ㅜㅡ
=
박봄 진짜 짠하다.. 기교 150%는 원래 창법인가보네 그거때메 가끔 좀 몰입 깨지다가도 끝에가선 나도 덩달아 울뻔
=
Park Bom give her soul .....Park Bom FIGHTING
=
투애니원 노래는 워낙에대중적이여서 노래는다알아도 멤버개개인 성격은 팬이아니여서 잘 모르지만 박봄은 생각보다 참 정도많고 마음도많이여리구사싶음.. 목소리떨리는게 느껴져서 맘아픔... 뭐가그렇게 박봄을 아프게했던건지... 언니를잘모르지만 10대시절을 계속함께한 박봄언니이신만큼 괜히 정이더감ㅜ
=
❤❤❤
=
Park bom ended that beautifully.
=
양혐석 진짜 용서못해 나쁜자식
=
MARK MY WORDS. WHEN EITHER DARA, MINZY, OR CL JOIN BOM FOR A PERFORMANCE. NO DOUBT SHE'LL WIN
=
Park bom voice  no word left for her voice such an amazing singer
=
봄언니가 정말 행복해지길 바래요
=
O microfone verde aaaaaahhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
2ne1 tv때 지디가 그랬지. 박봄목소리가 들어가면 모든 노래가 좋아진다고... 엄청 좋은목소리라고♡
=
I miss 2ne1 ..i hate Yang hyun suk 😭
=
둘이 보컬 되게 잘 어울리네요 곡은 심금을 울리고..
=
She always used the green mix 😘😘😘😘😍😍😍
=
Bom sang it deep from the heart 😭👏
=
썸넬 봄이언니 머리 길이보고 놀래서 들어왔다가 허수아비 노래 영업 당하고 갑니다
=
I cried as soon as Bom sings
=
They put a lot of emotion and work into this song. I think putting passion and emotion Into something it’s what matters.  Everyone did good, but for me... they deserve to win this time.
=
Bom ahh it's okay baby don't cry ♥️😢
=
Hyojung’s voice after Bom’s highnote 😢💯
=
Can we also appreciate hyojungs talent? All the comments was for bom only.
=
그동안 견디느라 고생많았다 진짜 앞으로 행복만했으면 좋겠다..ㅠㅠ
=
Park Bom queen of personality and real feelings
=
몇번을 봐도 슬프네여
.... 박봄 파이팅 응원할게여
=
소리만 들으면 우는건 봄언니인데 왜 내눈에서 눈물이 나는거야.......
=
Park bom, you are not alone.. we are here, always support you, loving you🥰🥰
=
They sing so well
=
ME ENCANTOOO LAS DOS CANTAN TAN BIEN QUE HERMOSO QUE HALLAN CANTADO JUNTAS ESTA SONG ME llego en el corazon 😭❤️❤️❤️
=
진짜 암넷... 빨리 음원 주세요
빠아아아알리리이ㅣ이ㅣ
지금 주면 앞으로 암넷이라고 안할테니까 
빨리 움원 달라고요 빠아알라라아ㅏ라알랄
=
보컬 최고다 진짜...여돌들 벗기지말고
진짜 가수같은거 시켜주라고ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
im so proud you Bom,, you suffered alot but you conquer  it...  God bless bommie -ya....
=
Mahal kong Bommie pls keep making music 😊 missing 2ne1 vibe😢
=
오늘 너무 힘들고 그랬는데 울거같아
=
혼자서있는 허수아비처럼 이라는 가사랑 박봄 홀로 서있는 모습이 진짜 가슴 찢어진다
=
I AM HERE FOR PARK BOM♥️♥️♥️
=
진짜뚱뚱하다..ㅜㅜ
=
박봄이라는 사람이 얼마나 정도많고 마음도 여리고 무엇보다 2ne1을 그리워한다는거 알아요 정말 다시 돌아와줘서 고마워요 박봄이라는 사람을 알아서 하루하루가 행복라고 봄언니를 보면서 너무귀여워ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ너무 좋아 어떡하지. 이런 감정 느끼는 사람 있는거 알죠? 사랑해요♥ 정말 그동안 있었던 일 생각하면 마음아프지만 그냥 다 잘될거에요 정말. 지금 모습을 보고 팬이된 사람 여기있어요. 고마워요💚💜❤💙💗
=
I'm crying wtf !!
=
봄아 누가 뭐래도 블랙잭&봄쉘은 항상 너편이야 항상 화이팅!!!!!
=
박봄 목소리 듣자마자...오진다ㅜ
=
효정 숨소리 너무 아쉽네..
=
박봄 투애니원때 쓰던 마이크랑 같은색으로 커스텀 마이크 새로 맞췄구나... 그동안 힘들었던 시간보다 훨씬 긴 시간동안 행복하게 음악했으면 좋겠다
=
Her mic 💚
=
I remember when she had the controversy before. She said she cant even buy her groceries or shop her own clothes. I imagine how hard it is to hide in public and how she went through over the years. I love you Bom! And HyOJung  this is what a performance should be. You really expressed yourselves in this one. Huhu
=
Park Boooom! LOVE U
=
오늘같은날 이게 더 생각남 .... ㅠㅠ
=
I cry cry for watching 😢😢
=
박봄 목소리 그냥 너무 감동옴. .
=
봄앤쩡 둘다 너무 착한 거 아니냐ㅠㅠㅠ 게다가 무대 너무 감미로웠다고 ㄹㅇ특히 효정이 도입부랑 박봄 첫마디 뱉을 때 울림 장난아니었다....그리고 봄이 마지막에 울때 내가 다 슬펐는데 그래도 옆에서 효정이가 잘 위로해주고 서로 의지가 된 것 같아 다행이야ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
노래부르다 보면 감정 조절이 힘들었을텐데 아무래도 사연있는 노래이기도 하고 그렇다고 실수했다 자책하지말고 보여준 무대 최고였어 내 예상대로 엄청 잘했다ㅠㅠㅠ
둘이 보는 내내 너무 행복해서 캐미 못 잃는다 내가 아
=
큭 보컬 너무 좋아 이거다 오마이걸 노래 실력 개쩌는거 모르는 사람 없죠 설마?!!!! 워매 나 너무 쉽덕같다 띠용 머지
=
bomi ㅠㅜ
=
This is second place? Its should be first!
=
멤버들이 보면 얼마나 마음이 찢어질까 .. 나도 맘아픈데 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 양싸 시밸넘 욕밖에 안나오네
=
When bom sang the last line “ like a scarecrow I stand alone” every performance she does she never forgets her members so that line probably hit her more since she is truly standing alone now 😭
=
Park Bom is bigger than the universe <3
=
I didnt understand one lyrics...but the singing the music the scene...it makes me cry........saranghae bommie #parkbom #2ne1 #Queendom -- fan from PH 🇵🇭
=
When Park bom cry..i feel the pain...my eyes cant hold my tears...unnie fighting...! Queen Park bom..! go 2ne1💟💟💟💟
=
너무먹먹하다... 박봄진짜감정전달 잘해준거같다...ㅠ
=
2ne1을 왜 해체시켜서;; 걍...쭉 이어가지, 문제가 생기면 제대로 사과하고, 잘 해결할생각은 안하고..걍 해체시키고 덮고 넘어가려 한 양현석의 문제임;;
=
2ne1 come back please 😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
Why am i crying ?
=
허수아비 가사가 넘 슬픈 노래..😭
=
와 근데 노래대박
박봄님 머리진짜길다!
=
혼자 서있는 허수아비.... 전회사에서 해명 제대로 안해서 빛 못본 몇년동안 본인 이야기같고 얼마나 슬펐을까... 이제 계속 행복해야해 박봄은.....
=
hyojung did so goooood???????? wow
=
Scarecrow is originally park bom
Song..but given it to lee hi
=
Jeong voice would really suit a drama OST
=
Im not a fan but BOM's voice is really perfect for BALLAD. Her voice enough can make my heart sad immediately.
=
hyojung sings with so much emotion, im glad she was the one that sang this song with bom😭
=
이 무대는 사람의 마음을 울리는 힘이 있다... 눈시울이 뜨거워지네
=
1등했음 좋겠다ㅜ
=
다른건 모르겠고 이 곡이랑 목소리 너무 잘어울리고
감동적이다
=
효정이가 멤버들 대신 해준것 같은 느낌이다.. 박봄도 효정이도 둘다 흥하자 
외롭게 지내지말고 팬들과 꽃길만 걷자
둘 다 많이 사랑해!!!!!!!!!
=
박봄 목소리 대체 불가에 외모 너무 고급지다
=
The song is so emotional i dont know why i cried when bom start to sing her part. I can feel the emotion of this song💖💖
=
Solar in 2:51 is my mood lol
=
Bom I love you😘☺️
You should strong for 2ne1 and all Bomshell😊
Don't cry bom
=
효정은 깜끔하고 감정이 잘실려있고
박봄은 특유의 음색으로 노래에 집중할 수있게 해줌= 케미 너무좋아ㅠㅠ
=
박봄 점점 예전 얼굴이 나오는거같은데 ?
=
주책맞게 왜 내가 울고있누...
=
오마이걸을 더 알고 싶다면 브이앱을...
 If you want to know more about OH MY GIRL,
https://channels.vlive.tv/F51143/home
=
박봄외국인이예요? 발음이 어눌해서 몰입이 좀 안되네요ㅜ.ㅜ
=
하.... 참 가사가 주옥같네....
쓸쓸한 밤이다...
=
Me encantaría volverlas a ver juntas en otro programa de variedades :3
Hiciero tan bonita amistad, las amo ❤️❤️
=
박봄은 정말로 추억을 생각하게 만드는 목소리가 맞는 것 같다
=
듣다 울었다....
=
I just notice bom is like telling a sad story in this song so many emotions
=
I am deceased. Thanks
=
I didn't know how much I missed hearing Bom's voice until she came back. It has so much emotion, depth and  is magical. Making me cry over here everytime she attempts to sings a slow song.
=
근데... 난 왜 박봄이 노래부를때 1.2배속으로 동영상을 플레이한거처럼 느꼈지?
=
Ngga ngerti liriknyaaa, tp kebawa sedih
=
*Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself" - the last line when bom cried 😭😭😭
=
3:05
=
park bom im crying i luv u
=
Comeback 2ne1🙁
=
Park Bom is a fighter! After she has gone through she bounced back to where she is right now. I am so happy for her. Fighting Park Bom!
=
Eng trans:
They say to me, “Why don’t you know –
That no matter what kind of love it is,
it all changes after time passes”
They say that even after 1 year,
things change from now
And that there won’t be any painful things then
But I know my heart very well
I know so well that it won’t change
Because everyone has a soul mate in this world
And that kind of love cannot be forgotten
You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can’t forget you like this
Like a scarecrow,
who stands alone even after everyone leaves
After the sun sets and everyone goes home
I am standing alone in a wide field
Little by little, I can’t see ahead
of me because of the darkness
It makes me more and
more afraid of being alone but
When I opened my tightly
shut eyes at some point
Beautiful stars were shining
Like the images of you,
who left far away
As I looked at them, I prayed that
you’ll come back to me some day
You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can’t forget you like this
Like a scarecrow,
who stands alone even after everyone leaves
You may think that I forgot about you
(oh, you may think that I)
You may thing that I am happy
with someone else
(forgot you)
But I still can’t forget you like this (I can’t forget)
Like a scarecrow, who stands
alone even after everyone leaves
(Even if you leave me, I’m like a scarecrow)
Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself

2ne1 please reunite again

=
효정 입덕 ...
=
can we have a petition to make 2ne1 perform as an special guest on mama 2019?
=
Every song Patk Bom has sang in this competition carried such sadness that you can't help the reactions. You can hear it in her voice and you can see it on her face.
=
damn. i felt her pain.
=
😭♥️🇧🇷
=
Love parkbom she is the best
=
서로의 아픔을 이해해주는 마음이 느껴지는 무대 음악에 대해 모르지만 진짜 감정이 담긴 노래가 뭔지 알 것 같아요. 두 분께 정말 감사드립니다.
=
Perfectt
=
Park boom 😭😭😭
=
와 효정 첫소절부터 먹먹해서 곡이 끝나도 여운 남는다.. 무대에서 노래하면서도 진짜 심정 복잡하고 슬펐을듯ㅜㅜ
=
❤️❤️❤️
=
댓글 얼마나 내려야 한국인 나오니
=
Bommieeee💚
=
thIs is GoooLd perIodt
=
너무 멋있는공연이다
=
처음엔 박봄씨 발음 부정확한거때문에 퀸덤영상중 박봄씨 영상만 안보다가 이영상보고...오랜만에 노래들으면서 울었네요. 진짜...발음이 아무리 중요하다해도 정말 진정성있게 부르는 노래가 어떤건지..그리고 얼마나 쌓아올려진 실력인지 노래 잘 모르는 제 마음이 아플정도로 울컥 하네요.
=
I cried so much. I felt every word, Bommie we are with you and I’m proud of you for fighting through all your struggles. We love you so much and never forget to remind yourself that there are millions of people rooting for you. 
I’m glad Hyo Jeong was with her. She needed someone to lean on and you were there. You are an angel to Bommie 🖤
=
We love you bom 😍😍😍💙
=
Bom's Mic!!!
=
Feel so sad...very touching performance.. :(
=
역시 박봄이다...
=
이번 기회에 전세계 사람들이 효정 음색 오진다는 거 알아줬으면 좋겠다... 그리고 ㅋㅋ1:20 밈 앞머리 졸귀탱 ㅠㅠ
=
ㄷㄷ 박뵴님머리 완전 기시네염 ㅎㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ..
=
They blended so well you know like salt and pepper. makes me wanna cry every time I hear their version. I know this song back then. And it still hurts specially when Bommie and HyoJunh sang this. Love you both. Stay strong everyone.
=
Eng sub please ❤ bom... 😍😍😍
=
:"(
=
Bom's last line saying that "standing all by myself" and she crying because she is alone without her fellow 2NE1 MEMBERS i'm crying BOM YOU ARE NOT ALONE
EDIT: THANKS FOR THE LIKES
=
Park bommmm ❤❤❤❤❤
=
박봄 목소리를 누구보다 좋아합니다...컴백을 환영해요
=
퉤니원 완전체 보고싶다 사랑해요
=
그냥 보는 내내 소름 돋고 눈물이 계속 나온다
=
편집 잘못한듯 소리랑 입모양 엇박자나네
=
Really amazing best presentation is full of true emotions.
=
We can feel your emotion,We can feel your loneliness,We can feel your pain,you must be hard and alone when 2ne1 disbanded by YG and people who misunderstood you, We, Blackjacks and bomshells will always Stand by you,2ne1 4ever.💛️❤️💜️💚️
=
unique voice bom unnie💓
=
나 왜 울고있는거야ㅠ
=
this song was originally Bom's. it was given to Lee Hi
=
박봄 음색은 여전히 좋은데 좀 힘들어보인다ㅎ
=
Miss you park bom
=
박봄 음색 진짜ㄷㄷㄷ 한소절 부르는 순간 크으b 소리가 절로 나옴. 양발롬 진짜 저런 음색 냅두고 디싱 2개가 뭐냐 정규까지는 못하더라도 미니 앨범 한장은 내줬어야했다 (하긴 퉤니 원도 정규 2장 내고 해체였지?) 여담이지만 그렇게 폭망할거 소속가수들 노래나 좀 원 없이 내주지 그랬냐 진짜ㅅㅂ
=
I'm not even a fan of 2ne1 but when Park Bom started singing i felt goosebumps. Why do i feel so sad in her tone while singing :(
=
"LIKE A SCARECROW STANDING ALL BY MYSELF" BOM CRIED AT THAT LINE😭💔
=
봄아 항상 응원해 이제는 매일 웃는 일만 가득했음 좋겠다..!! 곁에 응원하는 사람들이 많다는거 잊지말고 예전처럼 당당한 박봄의 모습 보여줬으면 좋겠어!!
=
😩😭😢💐🌹 ILOVEYOUBOM
=
I Love you Park Bom stay strong 💕💕2NE1
=
방송볼때 눈물범벅됐다 볼때마다 눈물나고 박봄 정말 대단하고 효정이 너무 이쁘고 착함... 사랑에 빠졌음
=
박봄이 노래 중간에 눈을 감는듯 살짝 찌푸리는데 울음 참으려고 하는 표정아닌가 했는데 아니나 다를까ㅠㅠㅠㅠ😭😭😭😭부르면서도 울음 참듯이 부르는 것 같아ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Iloveyou #Parkbom 😘😘😘🇵🇭
=
난 퀸덤에서 되돌돌과 더불어 이 노래가 제일 좋았는데 음원으로 결국 나오지 않는거 같아 너무 아쉬움. 오는 12월에 박봄 싱글앨범이 나온다는데 허수아비 박봄 버전이 거기에 포함되었으면 .. 하고 바라는건 무리일까? YG에서 타사에 커버음원을 허가해 준 첫 케이스가 박봄이 부른 태양의 '눈 코 입' 이라고 한다. 이왕 해주기로 한거 허수아비도 풀어주었으면 ... 아니면, 겨울감성의 곡이라니 ^_^ 허수아비 같은 찐 소울 발라드 음악이 포함되어있었음 좋겠다. 새 싱글앨범에 '되돌돌'도 있을텐데 너무 기대됨 <33

=
눈물이 났는데 왜 나는지 모르겠다.
그냥 눈물이 흘렀다
=
The feeling that I haven't cried for months and then I cried because of park bom. 😢😢😢😢
=
park bom I'm cry
=
박봄이랑 가사가 너무 잘 들어맞아서 더 슬프다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 울지마요
=
아니 이 무대에 무무봉이 왜 있냐고요
=
효정과 봄의 무대인데, 너무 박봄의 슬픈 이슈에만 치중하는게 아닐까. 나는 효정과 봄의 발성 창법이 달라서 걱정했는데 무대에서 조정잘해낸걸보고 그걸 이야기하고 싶은데... 다들 너무 봄의 슬픈(자극적인) 이슈에만 치중하는것 같다... 물론 이 무대가 한을 녹여낸 무대지만, 자극적인 이슈를 계속 언급해서 불을 지피는게 박봄에게 좋지만은 않을거라는 생각이 드네...


별개로, 허수아비팀의 에피소드랑 무대를 보면서 두 사람을 앞으로 케이블에서 오래오래 보고싶다는 생각이 들었다... 
한 무대라도, 하루라도 더 오래 이 시장에 남아서 오래도록 볼 수 있는 두사람이 되었으면 좋겠다는 생각이 드는 팀이었음 
아하이고 쓰면서 눈물이 나오네 나 지금 운다... 내눈물 지금 메소포타미아까지 흘러서 나일강범람시켰음... 


봄은 밝히고 자시고 언론으로 이미 슬픔이 까발려졌고, 효정은 단단해서 본인의 슬픈 사유를 입 밖으로 내지는 않았는데
에피소드 보는내내 아 둘다 그간 얼마나 힘들었으면...하는 생각이 들더라. 그래 아이돌 힘들지..
리액션 하는 다른 그룹들이 허수아비팀을 보면서 슬프다고 느낀게 그저 박봄의 사유를 안타까운 남일 보듯해서 그랬을까
나는 아니라고 본다... 다들 아이돌의 힘든 생활을 아니까, 그러니까 무대보면서 마음이 아프지 않았을까... 무엇인지 무엇보다 잘 아는 사람들이니까...


행복하고, 그냥 행복해지는게 아니라 퀸덤이든 어떤 활동으로든,

이 케이블 위에 서는 이유를 본인들이 찾을 수 있어서 
아이돌 활동을 했다는게 너무 힘들고 아픈 기억으로만 남지 않게 되면 좋겠음...
=
그래도 중간에 안울어서 다행이네...
=
효정과 박봄 둘다 이 노래로 치유되는 느낌이 든다.. 아아팀이나 구오팀이 무대나 노래면에선 더 앞서는것같지만 이 노래는.. 이 무대는 뭔가 해방시켜주는 느낌이 든다. 잠시 예술의 경지를 넘어 인간 본성을 건드리게되는 시간.
=
박봄은 사람을 울리는 뭔가가 있다 진짜 ㅠㅠㅠ 한소절 한소절 너무 슬프다 진짜
=
2 girls who have suffered so much
=
Bommie don't cryyyyy 😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
😍
=
😍
=
The emotions is so pure you can feel how she wanted to cry the moment she  sang her part. Bom unnie fighting!!
=
미주 손으로 얼굴가릴때 확대하는 카메라 ㅅㅂ...ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
눈물나
=
Love you BOM
=
Hyon jun kept breathing on the mic. That's pretty disturbing.
=
Omg her hair is sooooo long
=
Green mic 😥
=
난 여러번 보니까 느낀게 효정은 초창기때 (예전에 있던) 슬픔을 잔잔히 읽으면서.. 나 그때 힘들었어 인데  박봄은 지금 현재 자신의 감정을 말하는것 같아서 눈물이 나온다..오마이걸팬이지만 박봄이 너무 감정을 잘 들어내서 감동받았어 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 뭔가 잘 안어울릴 것 같았는데 생각보다 잘 어울려서 너무좋다ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 아 뭔가 둘이 표현하는게 다르면서 비슷한것 같은데 뭐라고 설명해야될지.. 전 방송에서는 박봄이 효정을 달래줬는데 딱 노래 부를때는 박봄은 현재 힘들고 효정은 나도 그 맘 알아 같아서 ㅠㅠ 눈물나옴 ㅠㅠ 나 뭐라는거냐ㅠㅠㅠㅠ  (제 개인적인 생각입니다)
=
Bom's voice is already shaky from the start. The whole performance is super emotional. We love you, Bom.
=
they all seem to enjoy her singing but ....... I don't understand the audience at all. whatever she looks healthy and happy that's all matters. and also i get to see park bom every week what more i need...... (yes i need more like 2ne1 reunion)
=
처음에 들었을땐 안 울었는데, 외국인 친구가 무슨 노래인지 설명해달라고해서 설명해주다가 울컥함... 그 뒤로 들을때마다 눈물 남...ㅠ
=
I love them
=
들러리 같은 치우침이 느껴져서 아쉽네요
=
노래 들으면서 운적이 거의 없는데 봄이가 부른 노래 듣고 오늘 눈물이 많이 나네요ㅠ 저 중학생때 한창 왕따 당하면서 애들한테 맞고 들어온 날이면 집에 멍하니 틀어박혀서 투애니원 티비를 몇번이고 돌려봤거든요. 나도 저렇게 자유롭게 멋지게 살고 싶다고 생각하면서요. 그때 투애니원의 모습이든지 노래를 들으면서 큰 위로를 받았는데 그래서그런지 봄이 노래 들으니까 그때 생각도 많이나고 봄이 데뷔곡이 될 뻔한 곡이었다는 사실에 더 눈물나요. 봄이는 그때나 지금도 위로가 많이 되는거 같다 항상 고마워💜
=
엄청 많은 생각이 들면서 무대를 한것같다..
=
역시박봄...노래진짜잘한다
=
I can feel the emotions even without the english subs.. BUT someone translate this to english please. 😭😭😭

=
아..외국인......땜에 댓글을 못읽겠음......;;
=
허수아비 다른 후배들이 부담스러워해서 바뀔수도 있었는데 꼭 같이 하고싶다고 한 효정이 귀인이네
방송 보면서도 박봄이 투에니원 그리워하는거 느껴졌는데 무대 보니까 얼마나 힘들었고 그리울지 전달된다 ㅜ ㅜ 허수아비 진짜 박봄 잘만났다 ㅜ ㅜ
=
their performance has to be my favorite out of the three duets. i think they sounded absolutely amazing, but i personally did not think their voices fit the greatest together. either way, they both did an exceptional job with the song and conveying such strong emotions and that sky rocketed them to the number one spot for me. plus, bom crying at the end made me cry too. i love them both of them so much, truly. <3
=
다좋은디 머이카락이왜 허벅지까지와...
=
Why I crying .?😭😭

love you Bom😘😘
=
2NE1 please comeback 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,,, im ccryong... 😢😢😢I miss the old YG so muchhhhh
=
박봄님 붙임머리 인가요??
=
다른노래도 좋지만 듣기시작하면서 끝나기전까지 소름이 계속 돋는건 이거하나다...진짜..
=
I love that her hair is longer than her dress 😂 queen (bom)
=
Aku gak tau apa arti nya lagu itu, tpi melihat unni bom menangis, aku juga ikut nangis😭
=
I can’t take this anymore. 
I like 2ne1 because they were 2ne1. 
I like Park Bom Because she is Park Bom. 
Let’s face the fact, 2ne1 is never gonna come back!!!
Let’s move on!!
They are still amazing individuals!!!
I don’t like the fact that every time we saw Bom and Dara and we had to mention 2ne1 again and again and again... I loved them when they were together... but I still wanna support them even they’re not together anymore!!!! 
2ne1 WAS our legendary queens. 
Park Bom IS our queen!!!
=
They get second place . Even they didn't get first place , but Im happy their talents getting recognize. They deserve top 3
=
it really looks like she's dedicating this song to the blackjacks/bomshells out there because she used her 2ne1 green iconic microphone..
=
I totally didn’t cry ..
=
너는 애가널다잊은줄 알겠 즈만
다른사람과 행복한줄 알겠 즈만
=
There might be other main vocalists with stronger voices than bom but not many have that soul and magic that hers does ❤️❤️ defo my favourite of the vocal performances that night
=
효정이 목소리가 이렇게 고왔나..?효정이는 가수안했으면 아나운서했겠다...목소리가아니고 옥구술이야
=
Hyojung with ballads 
Park bom with her supposed to be debut song. I cry thinking about the lyrics

😭😭😭😭
=
Maybe CL, Dara, and Minzy were crying too while watching this.. Oohh my blackjack heart.. 😢😢😢
=
QUEEN PARK BOM
=
Has anyone know the title of the song
=
I notice that Bom was wearing different outfit during rehearsal stage. It was a little bit more fancy than this one. I guess she just changed it so that it would goes well with Hyojeong's outfit.
=
다들 너무 잘했는데 다시 보게 싶게 만드는 무대는 이 무대같다
=
Pls #cl #dara and #minzy hear out #bom heart calling out your names💖💖💖 We need #2ne1 reunion or collab...pls guest on #queendom #mnet or in #mama2019🙏🙏🙏 #blackjacks unite💪💪💪
=
still crying after watching this for nth time... they really put all the emotions into this song...
=
I can feel Ben vibe in Hyonjung's voice! It's so sweet and emotional 😢❤️
=
There was no subtitles when I watched this, but I dropped my chicken and fries when they started singing. And I cried when park Bom cried at the end😔😭. This is a really such an emotional and comforting song , I hope they keep in contact and have a really tight unnie dongsaeng relationship !!
=
Can we just appreciate Bom's weave, rapunzel who?
=
식당에서 혼자 순두부찌개 먹으며 보다 현눈터짐
=
I want 2ne1 backk😢😭
=
I cry at 0:01 and cry harder as the time goes by
=
I think park bom should sing ost. Amazing voice
=
Queen bom😘
=
I was amazed by the length of her hair at first but i'm crying towards the end. Didnt understand the language but i can feel her emotions through the song. Hope the 2 of them could sing more songs like this.
=
Did JYP had a premonition when he wrote this song? I think this was given to bom around 10-11 years ago. I mean this is a sad love song about holding on to someone even when they already left. But as a fan, the message of the song after 10 years of 2ne1 history became different. Listening while looking at the lyrics I suddenly realized: 

maybe Bom is singing for SOMETHING rather than someone. She dreamed of being a singer and she became a member of one of the most succesful girl group in the world. Then after all the hatred from the media and public, that dream disappeared. And now she is telling us that eventhough there are a lot of setbacks in achieving her dreams again, she is holding on and looking forward to that bright star ahead of her like a scarecrow... 😭😭😭😭
-4ever ♠️♥️♣️♦️ -
=
Hyojung's voice really hit me, i can feel her pain, her emotions and i wanna cry with her and comfort her 😭😭😭😭
=
"After everyone leaves, I stand alone, like a scarecrow" this part made me cry. iloveyou bom and 2ne1. hyojung you also did great:)
=
solar is such a mood
=
Omg park bom is really in pain truly 😔😔😔 stay strong bommie
=
This song was supposed to be Bom's solo right?
=
이 노래 중딩때 겁나 많이 들었었는데 .. 숨겨진 띵곡임 모르는 사람 은근 많어
=
감동이 뭐냐고 묻는다면 이거다.
=
Wahhh the green micccc
=
음정 창법 이런게 중요한게 아니라 마음을 얼마나 담는게 중요한지 잘 보여주는 무대. 솔직히 투애니원 관심도 없고 이 노래도 처음 들었지만 듣고 울컥했다.
=
So this was supposed to actually be Boms song but they gave it to Lee Hi?
=
Music is to people to feel not just for the ear. We have diff. Perspective just respect that. We love Bom performance you can say all you want about the crying part but we feel her heart. 
I don't get why some people are pointing fingers to Bom because she cried in the last part. Like duuuh its like you did all the good things but they will still remember the bad things in the performance. Like crying is not a bad thing you should all learn how to show your true selves. Some people are always posting about negative and bashing people but they can't even look in the mirror cause they don't even know who they really are. Okay this is getting out of line. Goodness lets just respect one another.
=
Park bom is the one who made me into kpop since i watch her solo ‘you and i’ when i was in high school, her song is the first korean song i tried to sing and memorized bc im so amazed with her vocal. But i need to be honest that this wasnt her greatest performance, idk maybe bc she was nervous or what but her voice trembling a lot since she started singing, and she lack of power while singing. Im so happy she can sing this song again, but her past performance of this song is way much better than this. I know YG kinda hurted her voice but at least they always tried to make her voice stable, and i hope that her current agency will do the same thing, they really need to take care of her voice, bc bom’s voice is gold.
=
She is using her green mic!
=
엠넷 영상 제목좀 깔끔하게 달아라 정신이 하나도 없다 아오
=
When you make other people feel your music then you are doing your job what you're supposed to do.. And she did her job.
=
박봄은 진짜 사람을 노래에 끌고간다.... 한순간에 바로 감정이입하게 만들고 노래를 잊지 못하게 만든다...
=
😭😭😭💔💔💔
=
싱크가 안 맞노
=
어떡해.... 효정도 못부르는거 아닌데.. 박봄옆에 있으니까 너무차이남...
=
HOW CAN SOMEONE DISLIKE THIS??!!!!!
=
yg애들 사건사고 때문에 주변사람들 다 떠나고 없고  2ne1은 자기들알아서 해체 그리고 혼자 다른소속사 가서 가수 활동 얼마나 슬프겠냐
=
투애니원 멤버들이랑 한 무대들을 다시 보면 박봄의 표정이 그렇게 밝고 빛날 수가 없다 오랜 팬으로서 단 한번이라도 좋으니 그 모습을 다시 볼 수 있다면..ㅠㅠ
=
There was spring and there was rain..
Unseen by all, alone in pain..
While watching each one, they start to unfold.. 
Your voice couldn't mask stories of the untold.. 
You try to be everything you lost.. 
Go back to the lies they had cost..
The truth had nothing to fear..
No longer fake smile will appear..
 I will keep you in my most inner shell..
Protect you from the pain you dwell..
I will have it washed away in rivers of rain..
=
3:24 Is that Arin? Why is she so beautiful? I've never seen her pretty like this before 😳
=
💔😭😭😭
=
I started crying when bom start to sing 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭I don't know why but I feel the pain

when the real queen cries on the stage, my heart feels very broken.  I know this song is very meaningful for Park Bom.. Who same with me??, 😢😢😢

박봄의 애절함이 담긴듯해서 더욱더 큰 진정성이 느껴진다,,

그 어떤 사랑도 시간이 지나 면
변하고 마는 걸 왜 난 모르냐 고
1 년만 지나도 지금 과 달 라져
내 생각에 아플 일은 없을 거라고
하지만 난 내 마음을 잘 아는 걸
변하질 않을 걸 너 무 잘 아는 걸
세상엔 정해 진 짝 이 다 있기 에
그런 사랑은 절대 잊혀 지지 않는 걸
너는 내가 널 다 잊 은 줄 알겠 지만
다른 사람과 행복 한 줄 알겠 지만
나는 아직도 이렇 게 못 잊고 있어
모두가 떠나 가도 혼자
서있는 허수 아비처 럼
해가지 고 모 두 집 에 들 어가면
넓은 들판에 나 혼자 서 있는 걸
앞이 조금씩 안 보이는 어둠 이
혼자 있는 날 점점 두렵게 하지만
어느새 꼭 감은 두 눈을 떠보니
아름다 운 별 들이 빛나고 있어
멀리 떠난 너의 그 모습들처 럼
바라보 면서 언젠간 내게 오기 를 빌 었어
너는 내가 널 다 잊 은 줄 알겠 지만
다른 사람과 행복 한 줄 알겠 지만
나는 아직도 이렇 게 못 잊고 있어
모두가 떠나 가도 혼자
서있는 허수 아비처 럼
너는 내가 널 다 잊 은 줄 알겠 지만
(오 나는 내가)
다른 사람과 행복 한 줄 알겠 지만
나는 아직도 이렇 게 못 잊고 있어
(난 못 잊고 있어)
모두가 떠나 가도 혼자
서있는 허수 아비처 럼
(날 두고 떠나 가도 허수아 비처럼)
혼자 서있는 허수 아비처 럼

My blackjack heart 💔 is crying after i watched the whole performance and i hope bom and  hyojung will be on top this time because they gave all their emotions and their experiences which related to the song😭
=
Park bom started singing. I cried. Dunno why
=
Park Bom very strong.i love you 😍
=
😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
Come to think of it, before it was passed on to Lee Hi, Scarecrow was supposedly Bom's debut song, even before 2NE1 was formed. And now, we have her singing it live.
=
엠넷은 싱크 다시 맞춰서 올려라..0
=
박봄은 한글자한글자 꺾어대서 발음도 다 먹히고 어찌보면 과하기도 한데 근데도 계속 듣게되는 매력이 있는거 같다 효정이도 잘했다 둘이 음색이 완전 달라서 어떻게 되러나 했는데 잘했오

Your not alone anymore bomi😭😭 please be strong more .. we know blackjack the hard times you face .. I'm so proud of you 😭😭 as well to dara minzy and cl.  Please be strong and healthy everyday 😇😇
=
As much as I love the dance prods and energetic performances.. But what makes a performance stands out isn't the flashy lights, the dance moves and stuff.. Sometimes, all it takes is a voice, a good lyrics and how the singer brings out the needed emotions to touch the audience's heart. If the judges or whoever in this competition isn't touched, then idk.. This is a true, genuine moment on stage.. No words are needed. The heart has felt it all. If this is the ".... Got Talent" competition and I'm the judge, I would've hit the golden buzzer immediately, not coz she is Bom and she is Jeong but it's the sincerity and heart in there..
=
박봄은 첨 나올때부터 눈이 빨개 울지마여 ㅠㅜ
박봄 외로운거 너무 슬프다 ㅠㅜ 나중에 다같이 만날수잇길

JYP write this song for park boom but she must debut with 2NE1, so JYP give that song for Lee HI 😭 and until now, JYP still love her voice 💚

Hyojung is so underrated

박봄의 목소리와 표정과 제스처는 감정을 전달하는데 있어서 아무도 못따라올듯...

OMG.

Everyone talking bout Bom when the other girl sang waaaaay better

=
Whats the title of the song?
=
😭😭😭
=
약간... 봄이가 2ne1 멤버 들한테 하는말 같다  자세히 표현하면 2ne1으로 활동하던 그시절을노래하는거같다.. 너무 슬퍼 ... 첫무대라 아쉬움.. 엔딩 이였으면 더 와닿았을듯...
=
I cried 😢😢😢
=
😭😭😭
=
Queendo 2..  I would like to see apink or BEG as sunbae group.. Hobaes all of current kpop.. Artist.. Haha or group

Park bom should sing every single song

효정도 과거에 힘들었고 박봄도 2NE1끝나고 홀로서기까지 힘들었던걸 아니까 10년 전 자아와 10년 후 자아가 서로에게 하는 위로의 말같이 느껴지네요...😭

Bro i didnt understand anything in the lyrics but Bom singing like that, her voice and the emotions, a bitch cried so hard, she tugged my heart there are literal tears ohmygod
=
박봄 목소리로 다 듣고싶다.. 진짜 박봄 목소리듣자마자 눈물남
=
중간점검때에 비해 둘이 소리 조정 잘 되었고 파트 배분이 바뀌었는데 산만하게 주고받지 않고 원 원 투 로 나간거 너무 좋다 ^_^
쩡파트가 살짝 걱정이었는데 효정 정말 너무 잘함 ㅠ 이정도로 불러준건 예상을 훨씬 뛰어 넘었음
그동안 봄 언니를 진심으로 따르는게 보였고 인터뷰에서 봄에게 1등을 선물해 주고 싶다고 한 그 마음이 노래에서 느껴졌다
음 하나하나를 놓치지 않고 새로움을 넣어 내는 보컬 스타일에서 봄의 의견을 충실히 반영한게 보여. 자기 스타일은 따로 있을텐데. 되게 착한듯
온 정성을 다해 연습하고 노래불러준게 다 보였다  효정은 노래나 외모를 떠나 마음이 너무 순하고 따뜻한 사람이라는 걸 알 수 있는 기회였고
그래서 박봄이랑 너무 잘 어울리는 커플이라는 생각이 들고 앞으로 다시 유닛으로 좋은 작품들을 함께 했으면

You know it means more to you when you feel the song deep down inside even though you dont understand the lyrics. Stay strong park bom. We understand the hell you went through but here you are flying and soaring because you didnt give up when you had every reason to.
=
Bom is special,is art,his voice takes me to heaven 🥺

Pleace do no go :c pleace I miss lisent your beautiful voice 🥺🥺
=
1:51 hahahah my mouth also while watching bom.  jaw dropping 😮😂
=
I honestly watch to know the reactions of the other 2ne1 members. I felt her towards at the end and if I'm crying, I want to see CL, Dara, and Minzy cry too!!
=
I LOVE MY HEART QUEEN BOM
=
BOTH of these girls gave me goosebumps ❤
=
Park Bom we love you... Thank you for continuing your dreams and giving us inspiration....😘😘😘😘😘😘😘

=
omg im crying 😪
=
This so deep
=
I ended 😭😭😭😭😭
=
박봄 음색 미쳤다 진짜 ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ
=
내가 진짜 노래듣다 울기는 처음이다 나를 울린 무대는 당신들이 처음이야..
=
Oh Bom ;.; I hope you know you have so much support from both korean fans and international <3
=
They are awesome <3 This broke my heart ): but was very very beautiful ;;;;
=
Hyojung did great.  Thanks for being there for Bom.
=
Oh Bommie we LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!!  You are NEVER alone because your ALWAYS in our hearts 💗💗💗💗💗 👑♠️💚💚💚💚💚
=
Please bring 2NE1 members to Park Bom😭
=
진짜 왜이렇게 슬프지 투애니원때 생각난다.. 박봄님도 갑자기 생각나서 슬퍼하신거겠지..ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠ😭
=
Hyojung did so well!!!!! And bom unnie my heart hurts, I miss 2ne1 so much  💛💛
=
I'm not crying, you're crying. Amazing!
=
아 눈물나..... 가사가 너무 슬퍼...ㅠ
=
WE LOVE YOU PARK BOM
=
Very emotional 😭😭
=
I don't think anybody has a dry eye by the end of this performance. 
We love you Bom♥️ You're never alone
=
Hyojung also make this song so touchy, Bom make it so teary and sensitive
=
Hwasa & Kei may have been daring but Bom and Hyonjung were more emotional.
=
너무 감동적이다 최고예요 👍
=
bom park deserves more she's an inspiration 2 any 1
=
bom is clearly holding back her tears the whole time in this performance. during practice time, she sounded so stable and she did all the high notes pretty well. but here, she couldnt do it in the end of the song and sounded kinda shaky. poor her :( but im still happy that bom can finish that song even though shes eventually crying. and both are great! they can harmonize their voices so well. so proudd!!
=
봄쩡 수고했다. 너희들의 목소리로 이노래를 들을수 있어서 행복하다.
=
Bom, I love you. Miss 2ne1.
=
박봄!  역시!  멋진 목소리
=
Me cry 😢
=
SARANGHAEEE PARK BOM 💟💟💟💟
=
I may or may not have shed a few tears while watching this :,)))
=
รักป้าบอมจัง♥️
=
지디가 노래 부른다면 박봄처럼 부를 거같다 둘이 뭔가ㅋㅋㅋ비숫 같은 소속이라 그릉가 글구 머리길이 짱길어
=
Park Bom fightinggg!
=
I am forever proud of you PARK BOM.. for all those years you endured everything.. REAL BLACKJACKS WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU from DAY 1
=
1등 박봄언니 you are my sunshine and my bomb 🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀
=
HYOJUNG <333
=
😭❤️
=
Hyojung & Bom 💚💚💚 Stay strong 💚💚💚
=
OMG the last part I cry park bom been through hard life to all the shit fans who did this to her how bout u guys huh I can relate to her to. I just cry it hurts.
=
I think both of them using their own techniques to sing this song, but together it becomes so special.
=
She’s using the queen(2ne1) mic🎤 😭💕 blackjacks let’s support are queen💖
=
MY QUEEN
=
솔라표정=내표정
=
아아 3위하고 이게 1위할듯..?
=
Didn't realize Bom's hair that long.
=
I don’t even know the meaning of Korean words in this song, but I’m fucking crying. Park Bom can touch my heart with her amazing voice. OMG
=
What happened to 2ne1 and the way they’ve been treated is never not going to make me mad!!!
All the awful things Bom went through and the shit CL is going through now is ridiculous. The girls are so talented, kind and hard working, and they got treated like trash! Fuck YG!!!
=
Park Bom Unnie Don't Cry
=
The song make me so emotional, their voice is so beauty and blue. I’m crying truely 😭😭😭
=
박봄 좀 1등했으면 좋겠다.. 목소리 너무 좋아
=
Why I am sad?
=
박봄 짬바에서 나오는 목소리는 정말 깔 수 없다ㅠㅠ대박
=
😭😭😭😭😭
=
I can imagine Dara, CL and MInzy crying while watching this. Breaks my heart.
=
박봄이 부르니깐 더 와닿는다..
=
start from 3:36 the harmonisation were ....... i wish they can blend in even though they have diff voice colors it would have been perfect ughhhh
=
I don't even realized if my tears is falling down.

.
=
To those who didn't watch the episode, Hyojung hugged Bom onstage after the performance. It was cute ❤️

Also, they cried together behind the scene when talking about their experiences together. 😭

Ps. Honestly, even though I personally think Hyojung's voice is suited to harmonize with Seunghee's voice the most-- this team still did well without their vocals clashing so much.
=
I have so much respect for hyojung, so grateful she was able to express herself and hopefully find some healing through this song with such a big sunbae
=
This unit's vocal is no joke. Bom's voice is like emotions expressed through musical notes. You can literally feel it.
=
목소리 진짜 개좋아 ,,,
=
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
=
왜 박봄 얘기만 있지ㅠㅠㅠㅠ박봄은 믿고 난 효정 음색에 놀랐는데ㅠㅠㅠㅠ진짜 슬퍼 이무대가 가장 여운남고 갓
=
Been waiting for this song when i knew tat she will be singing this.
and tonight, i listened two times, i cried two times. So much emotions in it. My second song to be downloaded for this show
=
me*
i’m not going to cry 
i’m not going to cry 




also me
*sniffing and wiping my tears*
=
Everyone felt that no doubt.
=
와.. 박봄님이 우실때 울컥한다
=
박봄 근데 창법 바꿨음?


왜케 숨넘어갈것처럼 부르지...
=
Bom ơi đừng khóc , tụi em vẫn luôn bên chị yêu chị mà
=
I kinda wish they had gone last
=
I cry park bom is the best
=
ONE OF THE SADDEST PERF EVER AND THIS DESERVES ALL THE LOVE IN THE WORLD!!!!!
=
Scarecrow was supposed to be for Bom's solo but YG gave it to Lee Hi instead.
=
why she crying.. omg..  im sad too
=
What this song?
=
Jung made a great job 👌👌👌she is good😘😘😘😘 and Park Bom 😭😭😭dont cry we love u so much❤️❤️❤️ stay strong Boomie we are here to support you the world knows that ur such a wonderful person in and out ur members are always there though not physically present but in their heart they wanted to join you ☹️ hope 2ne1 will appear soon♥️♣️♦️♠️
=
I cried hard even when I dont even understand what they are saying I really felt the resentment 😭
=
I feel like the whole of Korea and the kpop community is united in their grief of 2NE1's disbandment. None more so than Bom 😭Please unnie don't cry, we're here with you and still supporting! I wish you could feel all the love that is being sent to you from across the world! 
Hyojung did so well too! I could feel her own heartbreak and troubles though her voice, what a beautiful stage 👏
=
這什麼回事？為什麼朴春唱的那部份我在流淚？😱
=
I feel so bad for her
=
Don't understand a single word but somehow still ended in tears ;____;
=
둘다 음색은 진짜 대박이네ㅠㅠㅜ 근데 박봄 음색이 너무 독보적이라 그런지 상대적으로 음색이 얇은 효정이가 조금 묻힌다...
=
Hyojung is wonderfull
=
효정도 감정 전달 잘하지만 박봄은 진짜 부르는데 내가 다 슬프다...
=
Watch me have no clue what the song is about and weep as Park Bom and hyojung tear my life in two
=
Crying really quietly rn bc my family's already asleep like my pillow is seriously wet of tears
=
When park bom singing, I always goosebumps
=
박봄아 이번엔 너가 퀸이다.
=
I hardly understand the lyrics, but my heart clearly understands Bom's feelings while singing and that is what Bom can do that not everyone can.
=
허수아비... 가사가 너무 슬프다.  박봄이랑 상황이 비슷한 가사인것 같아서 괜히 마음이 아파 박봄이 울때 같이 눈물이 나왔네요ㅠㅠ 외국인 분들도 이런 가사까지 알수있으면  많은분들이  공감 할 수 있었을텐데 아쉽네요ㅠ 퀸덤을 보면서 박봄의 새로운 모습과 속마음을 알아가는것 같아서 되게 좋은것 같네요ㅠㅠ 박봄 앞으로는 꽃길만 걷길ㅠ ⚘⚘
=
Hyojung was also surprised when Bom started crying. This whole performance was so sincere... It had me crying since both the lyrics and their voices carry strong emotions.
=
1:09 my favorite part by Hyojung <33 I don't know what it's called but the way she wavered her voice like that was so pretty!!
=
This really  breaks my heart 😭😭😭 literally!!
=
it's just break my heart 😢😭
=
When studio ver release ?!! 😭
=
Oh My Girl Hyojung❤️
=
I was longing for this. Who's else?😭
=
I cried the moment they started singing 😭😭😭😭😭 who's cutting onions
=
Aaaaaa this song, I know park bom felt😭😭😭😭
=
Wow Queendom this is an amazing platform to showcase how Talented Kpop artist are. And a chance to collaborate. 😻😻😻
=
This is heartbreaking
=
i’m crying so hard omg
=
Hearing this song from Bom again made me cry so much!!! ㅠㅠㅠㅠ♡♡
=
가사가 너무 슬퍼ㅠ 나같으면 노래 부르면서 엄청 울 것 같음
=
Oh no, love their feeling and voice 🥰 목소리 감정 너무 좋다..!
=
Just want hug bom and say youre not alone:"( . Hyojung please hug bom tight
=
봄 효정 다 너무 수고 많았어요 ㅠㅠㅠ 난 이 무대가 젤 좋았어 진짜
=
Napansin ko agad ung MIC niya pagLabas niya. .... .. 😭😭😭
WE LOVE YOU BOM/ BOMI/PARK BOM. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
박봄 목소리 너무좋은데 듀엣으로 부르니까 효정발음이랑 비교? 되면서 더 못알아 듣겠다.. 차라리 팝송이나 내가 외국인이면 자막보면서 노래만 들을텐데 허수아비처럼 가사가 좋고 뜻있는 노래라서 조금 아깝다. 근데 진짜 목소리는 진짜 대박임 따라올사람 없어 진짜
=
Bommie fighting ❤❤
=
누가 한글로 이무대좀 맛깔나게 평가좀여ㅠㅠ
댓글보는 재미가없네 ㅅㅂ
=
2NE1 Mic😭😭 this song for 2NE1😭😭
=
샹. 영어댓글좀 위에안떴음좋겠네.
=
Park Bom ♡♡
=
Hermosa interpretación 😢😢😢
=
朴春的聲音有很重的鼻音，不喜歡！
=
I really want to see 2ne1 members come and hug her on this stage ...

#foreverqueen
=
효정도잘했는데 박봄얘기밖에없어 ㅠㅠ
둘다너무잘했는데
=
듣는데 어떤마음인지 알겠으니 맘이 더 아프네 
외롭고 팀원들 얼마나 생각나겠어 . 보면서 울컥해지네 ㅠ
=
@1:40 my bae jin!!!
=
최고다 박봄!
=
박봄 보컬은 따라갈수가없다  눈물나 ....ㅠㅠ
마음을울려
=
Hyojung <3
=
Who dared to cut onions near me???????
=
Honestly, watching Park Bom prepare for this song really broke my heart. The part about her explaining the song of being the scarecrow and how being left alone standing still while watching other leave. Also, she may not have spoken of it, I know one of the darkest times in which she must have felt so so so so alone was when she was swept up in her previous scandal. When the whole netizens treated her like the public enemy and she had to leave the industry, leave her group (and sisters), leave all that she loves and watch other people continue on their journey toward the dream she couldn't move forward in. That must have really really broken her heart, her soul and all. I am just so so so so so so happy that she never gave up and despite her difficulties, she maintained her sincerity, humble and innocent heart, coming back once again after all that to go after what she loved. I hope she will only have good days ahead of her. I hope she will no longer have to face such hardship and that her path from here on forth will be a path of flowers. Bom ah, Hwaiting!! <3
=
Toooooo sad and really cannot watch again 💔💔😭
=
I think I missed someone
=
머리카락 진짜 길다..
=
봄언니 너무 좋다
=
Both of their vocals complemented each other very well! Big fan of Park Bom, I hope this Bom and Jung could be a thing after this show. Hopefully bringing 2ne1 back too!
=
나 박봄 안좋아하는데 이거 보는데 박봄나오자마자 슬퍼져서 눈물나옴...왜이럼..?
=
Idk why but everytime Bom sing i see her like shes chewing bubble gum😂 but woowwwwwwww  her voice really touch my heart ..i love u😭
=
언니 힘내요 ㅠㅠ
=
박봄한테 잘어울리는 노래인것같아요 노래가 너무 좋아요💜
=
Please don’t cry Bom.
=
노래좋은데 그 뭐지 mr인가 노래배경이 봄언니 바이브레이션이랑 안어울린다ㅜ
효정님이랑은 잘 어울리는데, 둘이스타일이 달라서 두가지를 듣는게 좋은것도 있는데 엄청 어울린다곤 생각들지 않는다ㅠ 
효정님 목소리예쁘고 담백하게 잘부르신다ㅠㅠ
=
I cry a lot i love u park bom ♥️🌻
=
Great featuring show ever...noticed for bom's green mic..Both of them so really good
=
매번 퀸덤볼때마다 맴버들 투애니원
그리워하는 모습들이 비춰지는 봄언니ㅜ
저노래가 더슬프게 들리다ㅜㅜㅜ
=
No one can replace the Queens.
2NE1 will be Queens Forever !
Fighting, Park Bom! You are very strong!
=
Ellas deberían de hacer una colobaracion después de que termine el programa.
Sus voces son preciosas 😭❤️
=
Lindo de mais..  Estamos todos chorando de emoção e satisfação em ouvilas..  E nada de tristeza em nossos corações!!
=
맘에 눈물 젖는다~~
진정성있고 노래가 아닌 음악이라는 ㅠ
=
박봄 컨디션이 안좋은지...음이 불안정 하네요.
=
I dont understand korean language but when Park Bom starts to sing, i feel so heavy inside.
=
편집할때도 갬성으로 에어팟 끼고 편집했나 싱크 왜 안맞음?
=
yung feeling na nakakalungkot yung kanta tas naalala nya
yung grupo nya tas feeling nya nag iisa lang sya  sakit promise 😭😭
=
Booom 😢
=
슬프다
=
Bomie, you aren’t and weren’t alone 😭 we are with you.. with you forever, our queen! 😭💙
We love you! 💜
=
They both slayed this perf. Please lets us all support them both. Hyojung and Bom!! 🙌💗
=
박봄의 눈물은 그만큼 노래에 집중하고 노래랑 하나가 되었다는 뜻이 아닐까
=
오늘 박봄 투어중 찾은 영상 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEjFADnYUL4 케이팝을 전혀 안 듣는 날 2NE1 좋아하게 만들어 버린 노래
=
mom told me am a die hard fun while crying during this performance of Park Bom.  
The lyrics is so touching.
She definitely stands her own after some people leaves her in back situation. I stand to Park Bom no matter what and the co-blackjacks as well
=
근데 박봄 머리 짱길다 허벅지까지 내려오네
=
😭😭
=
나만 개쳐울음??? 진심 감정이입 오져
=
It feels like watching a series and hearing the OST 😭😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️
=
아진짜 개슬퍼 ㅜㅜㅜ 가사가 진짜 미쳤음..
=
Now I’m also crying
=
Hopefully CL, DARA and MINZY join on the last stage of this show.
=
Elas cantaram super bem e tudo mais, porém não era pra ser tipo um duo ? Parece duas apresentações solo
=
That green mic.she truly miss her others members,and this song made me cry,they look good together ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
You know she's a great singer, when she's able to make you cry, she's not just singing its deep from her soul 😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
Im sorry park bom
I dont deserve you angel
I stan her hard since 2009 and left fandom for awhile in 2016 because it was too painful and make me depressed
But here i am now still stanning you,  you are beautiful and the kindest human in this world
=
근데 원래 박봄 발음이 이랬었나? 좀 더 부정확해진것같은 느낌.. 감정이 북받쳐올라서 그런건가
=
Hyojung voice is so good with the music and park bom is Park Bom... i cryed seeing this, i miss 2ne1 and thing that Bom misses too
=
Bom crying just breaks my heart. We all know how broken she was. Everything fell apart. But she is still here standing strong. I salute you Bom. You have my outmost respect.
=
When park bom sing i crying because i know who feel she. She feel so alone because in first she came untill now she dont have someone in she life after 2ne1 disband. I so sad when parkbom singging in last part
=
...박봄 역시 진짜 장난없네요...... 한소절만 들어도 이렇게 눈물나게..
=
Not gonna lie I don’t Stan omg but that girl has a nice voice
=
bommie cried😢 this performance really touches me, this song could mean a lot to Bom❤️ i also cried
=
노래를 듣는거만으로도 뭔가 뭉클해지네요. 방송이 끝나더라도 친목 계속 유지해주셨으면
=
Hyojung voice is perfect for this song
=
this is full of emotion. But anyone thinks that Park Bom's voice now is really unstable? Not only this performance but also others. Can anyone explain?
=
I think they both having past sad stories
And i feel them OMG
Makes me cry😭
I love you both
=
봄이 사랑해...쩡이도...
=
I hope MNet will release this single. Gaaaahd!
=
컴백후 박봄의 새로운 무대를 자주 접하면서 궁금해지는게 박봄은 이런 보컬을 어디서 누구한테 배운걸까? 2009년 2NE1 데뷔 전부터 박봄 보컬의 장르는 이미 R&B로 정의되었는데, 그룹활동 당시 R&B보컬을 보여줄 기회가 적은 상황에서 솔로로 부른 2009년 You and I 와 2011년 Don't Cry 로 판단해 볼 때 그녀가 선호하는 장르는 contemporary R&B 라고 판단이 되었다. 하지만, 컴백후 Spring 부터 이번 허수아비까지 쭈욱 들어 보면 박봄이 추구하는 보컬이 지금까지 우리가 들어 왔던 우리가 알고 있는 그녀보다 훨씬 더 진지한 R&B인거 같다는 느낌을 갖게 된다. 우연히 허수아비로 데뷔 준비할때 빅뱅 콘서트에서 부른 허수아비 도입부를 들어 보았는데 창법이 이번에 퀸덤에서 허수아비 부를때와 같은 SOUL R&B이다. 박봄의 나이 20대 초에 이미 SOUL R&B를 익혔다는 얘기인데 ;;; 누구의 도움을 받아 이런 어렵고 복잡한 보컬을 익히게 된걸까? 누군가 정성으로 가르쳐 주고 스스로도 열씸히 공부하지 않고서는 어려운 일이라고 생각되는데 스승이 과연 누구일까. 우리나라에 이런 보컬을 가르쳐 줄 사람이 있나? 아님 외국에서 배워온 건지. 너무 궁금한데 혹시, 잘 아시는 박봄 팬분 있나요. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5knKikPXL0
=
I still feel that this is the best performance. The impression and emotion is really good. Although vocally Hwasa did it for me but this tops the best vocal unit performance
=
Noooo she's crying 😭😭😭😭😭
=
Park Boom.. BE STROng... no matter what they say... YOUR STILL ONE OD THE Queens... 2n1 forever....
=
I just noticed her hair
=
Only blackjakes knows why bommi is crying .. our bommie was suffering so much ..queen stay strong plz
=
Who cares whos winner in Queendom but this performance make me cry 😭 😭😭 😭
Bommie i love u so much 
We are here blackjacks to support you ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
CRYING SO HARD ONCE BOM STARTED SINGING, tell me im not the only one...
=
😭😭😭😭 I think Bom just went “I am here alone without my 2ne1 members” and that just omfg I CANNOT I NEED THEM BACK
=
i almost cried of this show...
ouhh my i did not know that my tears falls down already
=
Aww hearing boom unnie singing while crying breaks my heart 😭 and wanna sing her her song entitled "Dont Cry"
=
봄의 상징인 저 초록 마이크를 사용하는 특별한 조건이 있나봐. You and I 랑 HANN 때는 안 쓰다 이번에 사용한건 허수아비가 그 만큼 그녀에게 특별하다는 의미인가보다. 허수아비로 데뷔했으면 R&B가수가 되었을텐데 ^_^ 어떤 미래가 펼쳐졌을까?
=
this unit performance is so raw and emotional, and when park bom cried in the end, my tears also start rolling
=
Before this year ends I just want a 2ne1 reunion.
=
i got emotional the moment Hyojung started singing…
=
She stand alone even after everyone leaves
=
끝에 울어서 더 아쉽겠다 자기한테 소중한곡이었던것 만큼 잘부르고 싶었을텐데ㅠㅠ
=
Wtf I can't even understand Korean language but this piece made me tear up 😢 The emotions are so ugh!
=
2:21 is the part when her voice started to change tho
=
1;45 you’ll already notice she’s about to cry.😢😢
=
OH MY GODD!!! WHY DID BOMMIEE CRIED 😭😭😭 i hope shes fine
=
Listening to both of them broke my heart. You can clearly feel the sadness and emptiness the song brings :(
=
The best duet ever, my fav two 💕
=
Hyonjung's voice is soooo goood
=
Omg love them both 😭
=
Win or lose this is the best performance for me , it really move my heart. I can't stop watching this. They give they're all emotions in this performance
=
박봄 마약 논란 때문에  2NE1 그룹은 거의 해체와 다름 없는 공백기가 찾아옴. 양현석 때문에 우물 안 개구리인 공민지의 탈퇴. CL과 산다라는 그 동안의 정으로 재계약. 하지만 공민지의 탈퇴로 사실상 해체 수순. 박봄은 마약 파문 때문에 활동 중단과 수 많은 악플세례. 자기 때문에 일어난 일들이 곧 팀 해체와 계약파기로 이어지고.. 그것이 곧 우울증. 사람이 혼자 견뎌낼 수 없는 마음의 상처.. 죄책감에 많이 시달렸겠지 박봄.
=
That Legendaey Green Mic thou 😭😭😭😭😭
=
I'm crying when bom sing :(((
=
Thank you Hyunjong 😭😭 For being there with bomie and giving justice to the song with her. 
We will still be here for 2ne1. Keep fighting Queens. 😭😭😭😭😭
=
I felt the sadness therefore I cri 😭 both shined~ i love you Bom!
=
Bommie. You've been through a lot. You deserve this comeback. Everything's okay now. We're still here for you. Keep your head high and continue being a sweet and cool sunbaenim to your hoobaes. ❤️
=
Im crying the whole song😭 ang sakit sakit 😭
=
Beautiful voice HyoJung
=
박봄 음색 너무 좋다ㅜㅠㅜ
=
솔라 표정 진짜 심각해보옄ㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋ
=
Both of you make this song amazing 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
=
효정이는 사극 오에스티 맡아야된다. 목소리가 왜 이렇게 애절하냐ㅠㅜㅜㅜ
=
댓글이 다 영어야ㅜㅜ 효정언니 너무 수고하셨어요!  제 눈엔 옴걸이 1등입니다!  봄엔쩡 케미체고체고!
=
This song is already sad. When park bom start sing, can't help 😢😢
=
효정 넘 잘했어..초반부터 벅찼다
=
😭😭😭😭😭 amazing colouration they make cry please someone tell me the title of this song
=
[해가 지고 모두 집에 돌아가면
넓은 들판에 나혼자 서 있는걸]
와... 가사 너무 슬프다 
투애니원을 끝내고 혼자가 된 박봄
그리고 화려한 일상을 마치고 
집으로 돌아가 공허함을 느끼는 연예인
퀸덤 출연자들의 마음을 대변하는 가사같네...
=
박봄버전만 듣고싶다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
근데 박봄 머리 개길다 안 무거울까
=
눈물.. 박봄만 부르는 허수아비 듣고싶다....

노래해줘서 고마워요

I have to plan to cry today 😭😭😭

=
효정 뭔가 벤 느낌같다 발라드가수
=
So many good and talented vocalists out there but only a few can give good emotions, touch hearts and souls thru their voices and music. For me only Bommie can give all of it. ❤ Hyonjung gave out a wonderful performance as well. Simple arrangement, just pure voices blessing your soul. Bommie and Hyonjung fighting! ❤❤❤❤❤
=
Like a scarecrow she stand by herself 😥😥😥
=
효정님 나오실 때 1차적으로 소름돋고 봄님 나오실 때 2차적으로 소름 돋고 그 다음으로 종합적으로 소름이 돋았습니다...들으면서 진짜 울컥했습니다...듣고있는 저도 감정이입이 되게 만드는 무대에요 진짜...진짜로 감탄만 나와요 두 분 다 너무 대단하세요 진짜...
 그리고 봄님 우실 때 저도 눈물이 나오더라고요 저번 퀸덤에 나왔듯이 진짜 이 노래 엄청하고 싶으시다고 하셨는데 그게 느껴져서 그랬던 것도 있고 가사전달력이 너무 뛰어나셔서...(역시 갓봄)
 효정님이랑 봄님 진짜 목소리합 장난 아니고 잘 봤습니다 ㅠㅠ
=
solar's face @ 2:50 is us tbh
=
💚😭💚😭💚  I love you Bommie!!!
=
와..박봄 노래듣는 순간 왜이렇게 울컥하지 나도눈물날것같음...목소리가 마음을 울린다ㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
😭😭😭😭😭 bommi ♡

💔 If this song is for YG -- see how much it breaks. When he left Park Bom hanging, especially during the controversy. 
How he didn't stand up and protect her.
How simple it was for him to neglect 2NE1.
How easy it was for him to disband his true girl group. 
How YG gave up on 2NE1.
=
I’m not crying, is just that... someone cutting onion next to me 🤪
=
This woman had been through a lot. I'm having mental breakdown watching this. Park Bom deserve better.
=
Park Bom my biass don't cry blackjacks loves you😭😭
=
why my eyes are sweating 😳
=
🥰🥰🥰
=
Las tres presentaciones fueron ARTE, cualquiera puede verlo.
Pero, sinceramente, esta presentación fue la más emotiva de las tres, ambas; Hyojung y Bom han sufrido bastante y aún así han salido con una sonrisa enorme para los demás.
Ambas han sentido que la soledad es su única compañía durante mucho tiempo, y puede sentir todo su dolor y emociones en sus voces. 
Espero tengan una posición alta en esta ronda, si no es así, no importa, ambas han ganado lo más importante; una amistad.
=
If you watched the previous episodes when they were still practicing, Bom's voice was really stable and was so perfect for the song. Their blending was in harmony especially how Bom puts a lot of adlibs. In this performance, she is holding back her tears as soon as she starts singing which is the saddest sound I have ever heard. DAMN, I really hate the feeling of hearing someone who is about to cry. It just makes me cry.  I cried 3 times watching this performance. Bom, I am your forever fan, a forever 2ne1 fan.
=
I love this. They're so successful in bringing out the emotions of the song and lyrics that they make everybody cry. Saranghae Park Bom and Hyojung
=
효정이 발라드 감성 듣고 싶으신 분들은 복면가왕에서 부른 희재 들어주세요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ https://youtu.be/kF-p68k6uHA
=
Park bom shatters hearts, she's been through so much x
=
That song makes all bomshells fan cry 😭😭😭 YG look what you've lost.
=
😭😭😭
=
Hyojung's voice is really really good. Bom...as much as I love her as a person...it's tough to listen to her straining. I really felt for her when she was crying though
=
다 멤버랑 같이 나왔는데 박봄만 혼자나와 많이 외로웠던게 터졌나 ㅠㅠ
=
한국댓글좀 올립시다ㅠㅠ
박봄 & 효정 짱짱케미 완전 찰떡이야 잘어울려ㅠㅠ💕💕
=
Bom's voice was shaking so much because she was trying to not cry :( still a beautiful performance
=
i can’t imagine if they didn’t win!!!
=
Translation
They say to me, “Why don’t you know –
That no matter what kind of love it is, 
it all changes after time passes”
They say that even after 1 year, 
things change from now
And that there won’t be any painful things then
But I know my heart very well
I know so well that it won’t change
Because everyone has a soul mate in this world
And that kind of love cannot be forgotten
You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can’t forget you like this
Like a scarecrow, 
who stands alone even after everyone leaves

After the sun sets and everyone goes home
I am standing alone in a wide field
Little by little, I can’t see ahead 
of me because of the darkness
It makes me more and 
more afraid of being alone but
When I opened my tightly 
shut eyes at some point
Beautiful stars were shining
Like the images of you,
who left far away
As I looked at them, I prayed that 
you’ll come back to me some day

You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can’t forget you like this
Like a scarecrow, 
who stands alone even after everyone leaves

You may think that I forgot about you 
(oh, you may think that I)
You may thing that I am happy 
with someone else 
(forgot you)
But I still can’t forget you like this (I can’t forget)
Like a scarecrow, who stands 
alone even after everyone leaves
(Even if you leave me, I’m like a scarecrow)

Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself

They both did a great performance, hope they get a good rate.
=
HYon Jung did great as well as Queen Bommie... I am sure Blackjacks and Bomshells are also crying upon hearing Queen Bommie cry. We feel you QUEEN!
=
I don’t see any subtitles after the first one (subtitle) 🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁 .......3:36 the second high note was kind of off 😬😬😬😬😬it was bad. She shouldn’t have transitioned like that

I've played it countless times but I'm still crying everytime i hear/feel bom's emotion. 😭😭😭😭

Everything about 2NE1 flooding in my memory.

박봄이 부를때  왜 눈물나냐??? 진짜 봄이 혼자 서있는 허수아비처럼 느껴진다....
=
I can't stand to watch my queen cry😭it's really make my heart broken into pieces 💔it remind me how much pain or hard she been through in past, I really wish or hope they got in top 3 at least so she can smile and happy like when she with 2ne1 and hyoujung(sorry if I spell it wrong) thank you cause she in the same team with my queen and spend her time with park bom so she won't be lonely, and hyoujung voice while singing this song make more emotionless
=
Bom and Hyojung killin it 💥 Im so soft after watching their performance 😭 its more than emotional performance 😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
The way Hyojung look at Bom when she cry .omooooooooo makes me feel more sad

Stay strong Bom. I'm so proud of you, we are so proud you. I hope that you know that. ❤
=
진짜 박봄 첫 소절 듣자마자 숨 턱 막혔다 ㅜㅜ 4명에서 1명으로 활동하게 되었을 때 그 빈자리가 얼마나 컸을지 상상하니 너무 마음 아팠고 ㅠㅠ 혼자였던 꽤 긴 시간 동안 구설수에 오르면서 느꼈을 아픔을 조금이라도 공감할 수 있었다..  특유의 창법이 외로움을 더욱 돋보이게 하는 것 같다,, 마지막에 울먹일 때 나도 조금 울었다 ㅠㅠ 몇년째 2ne1 존버하고 있는 나지만 누구보다 네명이 그리워할 사람들이 당사자들이겠지 ㅠㅠ 다시 노래해줘서 고맙다는 말 밖에 할 수 없다 ㅠㅠ 언니 순위가 어떻게 나오든 언니는 이미 queen 된지 오래,,, 고마워요 진짜 ㅜ

=
Man. Until now, I've been listening at a 2ne1 playlist in spotify. My heart breaks so much 💔 I fvckn miss them. I fvckn missed shouting at their concerts, getting goosebumps in each of their performance, waving our lightstick. I'm still not losing hope that they'll have a reunion someday. A goddmn comeback!

The emotion that only Park Bom can bring 😥 please come back #2ne1 #blackjack

Incrível! Ao mesmo tempo que parte meu coração me deixa tão orgulhosa da Bom!! Ela lutou tanto! Ela é tão forte!! Ela sempre acreditou no talento dela!! E sempre só quis cantar!! Ela é um exemplo!! Uma mulher que deve se orgulhar de si mesma!! Te amo Bom!!😍😍💜💜

난 노래 첨 딱듣자마자 눈물나던데..박봄이 부르면 몬가 울컥 거리는것도 있음 근데 전체무대로는 화사팀이 잘하긴한듯
=
Ini adalah satu2nya yang ingin ku tonton, sedari awal aku juga sudah suka dengan lagu ini, dan ku rasa bagaimanapun juga lagu ini tetap berhasil disampaikan dengan baik pesan nya, Aku sangat tersentuh dengan mereka, suara mereka sangat indah, dan membuat merasakan lagunya dengan tulus, ini seolah mereka bernyanyi dan berbicara dari hati dengan tulus, sambil menyampaikan isi hati mereka💕❤
=
I thought I would not cry at first...but then after a few seconds hear Park Bom voice my heart really feel the pain. I miss 2NE1 T_T
=
💖

Does anyone know her ranking for this episode?
=
뭐지? 가슴깊게 파고들어서 결국엔 나도 눈물이낫다 😭😭😭😭😭😭

방송볼때는 편집때문에 집중이 안돼서 제대로 못들었는데
다시들으니 쩡이 데스티니때처럼 감성  짠하고 잘부르네요
끝날때쯤 봄이랑 같이 울었어요 ㅠㅠ
=
한국인 댓글 읽고 싶다고요,,,,
=
박봄 마이크 소주병같다
=
I watch the live streaming earlier, I was started crying when Miss Bom sang. All the memories I witness with 2ne1 keep flooding in my mind, the scandal, which was not supposedly scandal after all. She hides from public, and the last stage was MAMA 2015. For almost 5yrs, she came back because she love singing. We, us, blackjacks, her true fans supports her whenever she needs us. This is the moment, Miss Bom wants to show us the songs she wanted to sing, not for us fans, but also for herself. Thank you so much for coming back Miss Bommie, we love you and always support you and 2ne1. Fighting 💪💪💪💚🍀🌽

The moment Park Bom started sining her lines, my heart broke into pieces. The emotion she gave on every song makes it very special. Even though I didn't understand a single phrase of the song, I started crying. 😓😭 don't cry bom!
=
If only audience vote wisely then maybe bom will be on top.. She's not the best but she's everything.
=
자기가 솔로데뷔할때 불를려던 노래니까 여러모로 감정이 벅찼을것같아요 ㅠㅠ
노래 듣다보면 옛날 감정들이 생각나서 슬플때 있잖아요 ㅠㅠ그런것처럼 와이지에서 했던 연습기간이나 멤버들보고싶어서 그랬을것같아요..집에서 혼자 저노래들으면서 박봄도 많이울지않았을까요ㅠㅠ
=
박봄 목소리는 정말 사기다...
=
I didn't understand the lyrics but I felt like it touched my heart. 
Respect this woman, she is been through a lot to sing on the stages again. And I know that soon she will represent herself as 2ne1. BC now 2ne1 vibe start coming little by little.💜💗

Love you Bom.
=
When experience plays with emotions, tears are bond to flow.. These two just hit us on the feels for real😥😢💞
Agree?! 👇
=
이거 듣고 울었다....ㅠㅠ 가사전달이 너무 잘됐다. 노래 듣다 운건 처음이네..
=
I wish CL, Dara, and Minzy watch this and give her sweet hugs
=
Im crying when bom cried too. 😭😭😭
=
지금 박봄님 상황과 너무 맞는 가삿말이 그리고 느껴지는 외로운 감정들이 가슴 깊이 콕콕 박혀서. 그래서 너무 슬퍼요

=
i cried even though i didn't understand but i felt the song 😢😭😭
=
Im crying #bomshel
=
Please help this vdeo to 1M chuseyo 🖤🖤🖤🖤 #blackjack
=
I liked the performance but I have to say that bom had too much struggle singing clearly cause of her emotions, that the song kind of suffered. She already has more of a husky voice in my eyes and then it was getting a bit too much for me. I totally understand why she was crying and the lyrics and atmosphere were very emotional and sad but as a professional u should still perform as well and steady as possible. So technical wise I would give the win to the other units, emotionally seen was this the winner.

Please no hate on my comment. It's just my opinion.
=
가사가 진짜 봄언니 이야기 같아서 더 슬퍼....
=
I relate to this song so much, and their soulful rendition of this just made me cry even more than normal
=
야이 미친 허수아비를 지금 듣는다뇨 퀸덤 사랑해요

Great collab and rendition ! This two ladies deserves on top. Eventhough, i dont understand the lyrics, i really felt the emotions of the song. Both artists are great story tellers. 😭😭😭

I love you BOM & HYOJUNG! 🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😍😍😍❤❤❤
=
Always looking forward to watch Park Bom performance. She moves me and I can’t control myself but to cry. She is really amazing and a real talented singer.. they way she sing and interpreted the song really touch my heart. Even if I don’t understand the language, her voice itself has soul to touch everyone’s heart. Both of them really do a good job. Fighting! Will support her all the way.
=
BOM PARK and HYOJUNG fighting always remember that we Stan you two and love 😘❣️
=
Thanks for Hyojung going for ballad. If no one wanted to do ballad with Park Bom, we won't have this beauty of a performance.
=
Bom voice is so touching, my eyes tear up
=
Hyojungg, i'm cryinggg
=
Thanks to 2NE1, Park Bom became one of the most active and popular R&B artist worldwide. While she demonstrated a contemporary R&B style in the past, in this stage, she did not hide her own R&B color, more original and classical.  I love it <33 Go Bom !! Sing your color !!   I am looking forward to tasting her next vocal performance.
=
I’m crying 😭😭

처음엔 박봄 목소리 너무 튀는거 아니냐 하고 생각했는데 봄 목소리가 너무 곡이랑 잘어울리고 너무 몰입도도 좋고 박봄이 같이 안불렀으면 안됐을거라 생각된다 ㅠ 너무 무대 좋았네요ㅠㅠㅠ
=
박봄 발음이 왜그러지..??음색은 진짜 좋다... 독보적이야
=
Try not to cry but I can't 😢
=
💓
=
She's been through a lot.... it really makes me feel bad that we cant even help her be number 1.. it's ok to breakdown one in a while, you're only human (but a superwoman).. you've inspired a lot of people because of the strength you've shown..
=
박봄 목소리는 진짜 대박,,
=
Their voices poured out all the emotions! Rooting for Bom & Jjeong fightinggg Bomshell's and Miracle! <3
=
why it is so sad?
=
나만 싱크안맞나 ㅠ??😭😭
=
My tears won't stop escaping while watching this performance. 😭😭 seriously why you make me cry
=
I was trying to be a thug and not cry but seeing Bom cry took me out completely! After everything she’s been through, I admire her for being strong. We love you Bom! We will always support you 😢😢😢 2ne1 will forever be in our hearts ❤️😢
=
She deserves so much more. My tears coming out when she sing until the last part. Our Bom, you're the legend, no matter how, we stand for you, our Queen.
=
Haaayss Im crying every time I hear how bom is holding back her voice.
=
HyoJung hát hay quá 💜
=
I CANT STOP BUT TEAR UP!!!!
=
Im crying even when i dont know the meaning of the song 😭
=
Oh bommie.. please don’t cry 😭 Blackjacks never left you though you felt alone all those five years, we are still here waiting for your comeback, waiting for 2ne1 reunion. We will never get tired of waiting. If only I can hug you right so you will realise our presence 💕😭
=
I was mesmerized by hyojung's voice but got goosebump hearing Bom's voice and is really painfull watching her cry at the end... The last lyrics really a sad words.... We are still here loving you Bom!! ❤️
=
OMG T_T miss 2ne1
lyrics
But I still can't forget you like this
I stand alone even after everyone leaves,
Like a scarecrow
2NE1 please come back!!!
=
박봄은 이번 허수아비에서 기존의 솔로곡들 즉, You and I, Don't Cry, Spring, My Lovers, Shameful, 4:44, HANN 등 에서 보여주었던 힙이 접목된 컨템포러리 R&B스타일에 비해 훨씬 고전적인 R&B스타일을 보여주었다고 생각된다. 왠지 본격적으로 깊이 있는 자기만이 추구하는 음악색깔을 펼치기 시작한 느낌? 개인적으로 퀸덤이라는 좋은 무대를 활용해 한두번 더 보여줬으면 하는데, 워낙 다재다능한 보컬이다 다음무대에선 어떤 스타일을 보여줄지. 너무 기대됨 ㅠ
=
진짜 감동이다!! 박봄도 효정도 너무 잘한다 특히 박봄은 정말 감회도 새로울것 같고...최고다!!!♥♥♥
=
Park Bom is not deserve to hate just because of her past!!
=
와 박봄 도입부 진짜 후덜덜이다. 진짜 둘이 캐미가ㅜㅜ 웃고떠들고할땐 마냥 귀엽기만 하더니 노래할 때는 세상 멋있네

솔직히 말하면 나는 박봄 창법이 독특해서 효정이랑 둘이 목소리가 잘 안 어울리는 것처럼 느껴졌고 마지막 부분 효정 고음 부분이나 이런 것도 둘의 창법이 너무 달라서 그런지 잘 안 어우러지는 것처럼 느껴졌음 근데 그럼에도 불구하고 울었다 특히 박봄이 부르는 게 나는 저 노래에 어떤 서사가 담겨있는지도 모르고 박봄을 보면서 박봄이 외로워보인다 이런 식으로  감정이입을 했던 적도 없었음 근데 그냥 박봄이 마지막에 노래 부를 때 내가 벅차올랐음 무대 완성도로 따지면 1등은 할 수 없다고 생각하지만 관객들에게 얼마나 감동을 줬냐를 생각하면 1등이 마땅하다고 생각됨

*Chills* 

😭 
Bom has been through a lot and really can’t we have 2ne1 back? Like please!! 😭 they can’t end like this
=
.Park Bom voice is the type that cut your breath and creeps to your soul and everything disappear and it's just a realisation of self existence. And that end tho.. her voice is just beyond AMAZING.
=
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢Nice performance 👏👏👏👏👏👏💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
=
Why she singing like the words are mixing together. Idk how to explained this.
=
What song?
=
this is so sad
=
Cómo se llama la canción?!!
=
I love 2NE1🍫🐇🍒🌽, forever 👑👑👑👑BLACKJACK❤❤❤❤
=
Performance wise, this is not Bom's best but this touched many of us. Blackjacks or nonblackjacks. I cant understand the lyrics buy I literally cried rivers. It hurts so badly.
=
I cried...
=
not sure if oh my girl will do a style concept like this one but if they do.... oh. my. girl. :P
=
I have no words to fully describe how I feel after watching this, but I know if you all could see my tears you’d understand.  I’m sure many of you feel the same.  You’re one of a kind Bom.  No one will ever be deliver a song like you do. Blackjack and Bomshell forever! 🥺
=
Am I the only one who noticed Bom's mic was her 2ne1 mic? Am I right?
=
진짜 진심으로 박봄 찐팬될듯 ,,, 쩡 앤 봄 💙💙💙
=
I see on bom’s eyes like she was calling dara, minzy and CL telling I need your help. They are in group and im here all alone fighting for BLACKJACKS/2ne1 to comeback. Haaays. Just guessing, i dont understand the song.
=
I got the feeling everyone was abt to cry
ddafkadjf I cried
=
This will work SUPERB if they stage this as young female idol seeing her older image and the older female idol seeing her younger image.

Hyojung is the start of Bom's career and Bom coming from today's time moving towards Hyojung, walking down the memory lane. They met and the younger self sees how strong her older one while fighting alone and the older self reminisce how her younger one living a good time and reminding her to be strong and brave.

Damn I'm crying so hard imagining this.
=
아이ㅆ  몇번을 들어도 눈물이나...
=
My heart shattered listening to this. Bom you deserved the world. I'm sorry for all your hardships. Your fans will love you forever💗
=
Everyone is talking about Bom's past, not knowing that Hyojung has gone through something worse. Her father died when she was just a kid, which must have left a deep wound, and yet she's one of the brightest and most cheerful people I've ever seen. How about some recognition for the queen of optimism?
=
Dnation, can Bom have a collab with HyoJung? Please please please. The girl has a talent and their chemistry is ❤. They won our hearts with the emotion they poured out.
=
2:51 Solar's reaction makes everything better. Love this woman
=
As soon as Hyojung started singing, I could feel the sadness building. I knew without even fully understanding Korean, this one's going to hit me hard emotionally. Then Bom began. I lost it with this performance. Knew she couldn't finish entirely. Everyone is shocked how powerful they are together and how well they conveyed the raw emotion of this sad song. Hwaiting Hyojung and Bom. You made my night. Saranghae...
=
Yes I legit cried 2 times while watching this..😭
=
Hyojung baby, you're fantastic 😭💛
=
BOMIIII😭😭 DONT CRYYY ATLEAST YOU'RE THERE NOW SINGING ON STAGE.. KEEP FIGHTING 😘😘 WERE SO PROUD OF YOU 💖
=
IM SO PROUD OF MY ULTIMATE BIAS, HYOJUNG 😭😭🥺🥺 gurl uve made it
=
after watching this , i watch the 2ne1 live and music videos 😔 and now i'm crying! I really miss them on stage , Please make a 2ne1 comeback 😔
=
AMAZING!!! Go girls
😭♥♥
=
I cried even though I don't understand the lyrics. I can feel the sadness in her voice.
=
I wish they also translated the lyrics for me to understand but the way they sing this song I can really feel the emotions especially bom she makes me cry😭
=
If Bom cries, I cry 💔😢
=
She's been through a lot😭😭
=
Don't cry my QUEEN 😔💖
=
You're still the best!!!!! 😭😭😭
=
이 둘 조합이 너무 좋아ㅠㅠ두분 다 잘하신다ㅠ
=
2:51 same, it's a lot to take in
=
I cant understand the song but when they sang it especially bom, i felt the sadness... How sad bom is. Stay strong bom
=
OMG I really cnt stop crying while  listening to this.. OMG, will watch later I'm having a headache from crying
=
It's always 2NE1 to make me cry and laugh with them. Bom ah dont cry, you did great with Hyojung in this perf. I always support you.
=
Solar's face though😍😍
=
1:21 누구지...
=
The emotional impact of this performance is overwhelming. The sheer power of this performance with Bom singing about what is basically her current life. And everyone is talking about Bom (rightfully so) but let's not forget about Hyojung who complemented Bom perfectly with her own soft vocals and later power vocals. Not to mention the song has an important meaning for Hyojung too and her own tragedy (watch the duo discussing the song in previous episode). Anyways Bom and JJung fighting!
=
마이크 본 순간 울었다....
=
Oh my god it's a beautiful song..i cried a lot
=
why am i crying?!!! uhmp! 😓😓
=
I dunno why its soooo sad!😢 waaaah very emotional!
=
Jaw dropped They are so amazing !
=
This is sooo emotional
=
Okay we all know who’s gonna win
=
Saranghaeyooo bommiee!! ❤️😢
=
Just a simple performance but success in make my cry.
=
오늘부터 봄언니 입덕!!!!
=
Why do I cry so much??!! I just miss 2NE1 :(
=
Park Bom :((((
=
Hyojeong baby well done 💛💛💛
=
Shoranding😭 pobre Bom♥
FIGHTING!!!
=
you won’t be alone bom.. we’ll always stand beside you even if everybody else leaves you.. we wont let you be alone.. never..
=
Omg she is using her 2NE1 mic 😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
BOM i criedddd
=
쩡이 목소리 겁나 좋다
=
They deserve to win 😍😘
=
You make me cry.
=
Bat nasasaktan ako pag dating sayo.. 😢😢
=
there they goes again
=
Let's go guys 1m
=
Baby please don't cray 😭😭😭
Mi kokor duele al ver a mi bella Bom así 😥
=
Baby pls dont cry.. 😢
=
💔
=
💔
=
박봄발음만 좀 개선했으면 좋겠어요ㅠ
=
HELLO YG.. i hate u.  miss u boom. cl.dhara.minzy
=
싱크가 좀 안맞는거 같은데
=
She used her green mic for the first time in the competition for a sad song. I guess she really wanted to express her feelings for 2ne1, blackjacks, and the hardship she endured.
=
I watch and cried many timeeees I really feel what bom's singing its really attacked my heart and make me cry hard😭 we love you Park Bom of 2ne1 FIGHTING!💕
JUNG AND BOM WHAT A GREAT COMBINATION!
=
ชอบคุณนะ ปาร์ค บอม
=
Who’s fascinating of Park bom’s microphone meant?Maybe you so miss 2NE1 but not only you Bom me the same
=
Honestly, whenever I am having a hard time, i always listened to park bom’s music. Cause her voice itself gives me comfort which is why I will always be her fan. This version is  better compared to when she first sang it at bigbang’s concert. She’s been through a lot and i really felt her emotions. Now, i cant stop crying. 😔
=
Anjir itu rambutnya Bom salkus gua
=
진짜 박봄음색은 개애져
=
We all know how Bom did everything to get the courage to stand in front again. Don’t cry Unnie!!! We are so proud of youuu!!  Thank you  hyojung for performing with Bom!! Loveyou, Park Bom unnie!!! Fighting!
=
I don't even know the meaning of this song,but when Hyojung started singing and then Bom came next I started crying,I'm feeling so many emotions rn. This is the POWER of music. 
I don't have any words.
=
I can watch you park bom I felt pity to you . I'm know you innocent ... Netizens are you happy look 2ne1 is disband ???? YG ? How are you now ???
=
I CAN FEEL THE STRONG EMOTION😭😭😭






To YG: Watch this👊
=
Luv you Bom
=
내 마음은 봄누나가 1위다..
=
Hope 2ne1 to come back so that everyone will become happy again
=
Hyo Jung and Bom are crying. I feel like crying too 😭
=
The stories behind Bom crying mean more than you all thinking. It’s really personal
=
The moment Bom started singing u can see her eyes went watery
=
I'm so proud of you, Hyojung ahhh!!!
=
Did you feel the sadness of the song? Like if you feel it too.
=
Park Bom crying just ended me, there are no words!
=
Wait i just see army bombs omg
=
Hyojung's opening lines made me teary eyed already, and Bom's voice made me bawl. I also love the production with all the lamps. So beautiful.
P.S. It reminds of Lee Hi's performance of Breathe
=
I Miss 2ne1
=
5AM IN THE MORNING AND MY EYES ARE ALREADY RED AND PUFFY FROM CRYING 😭😭😭😭
=
I cant stop my tears falling while watching Bom crying..😭😭😭
=
bom don't cry
=
박봄 머리카락 진짜 길다...
=
Park bom voice is iconic
=
THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION ANYMORE😭😭😭
=
I once read that Bom was supposed to be the one receiving Scarecrow but it was given to Lee Hi. So I guess this would make this kind of like performing her own song. It makes me happy and sad. ❤️😭
=
Park bom 😚😚😍😍😍
=
그래서 투에니원이 왜 해체 된거죠?
=
I love u bommy
=
Todo dia venho enaltecer esse video
=
I want Hyo Jung and Bom to release a cover of this song SEPARATELY. They both give me different vibe. With Hyo Jung, I feel like I'm listening to a heartbreaking ost. On the other hand, Bom gives me this feeling of sadness with raw conviction because she's like singing on a personal level and the pain just goes deeper with memories.
=
. Why is this so sad
=
Park Bom  i love you
=
I love you boom
=
박봄님 나 오실때 거짓말 아니고 다리털이 섬 ㄸ 신기하네..
=
Queenbom
=
No matter how much she is struggling to join this she always give her best and we blackjacks could totally feel it😢😢😍😍😍
=
It's something about the way Bom's voice cracks when she sings. It sounds very emotional and brings emotion out of me. And I don't even know what she's saying.
=
I love how Solar looks so horrified at everything HAHAHAH but in truth she is probably so moved and amazed haha what a hamster
=
Solar's reaction never change in all performance 😂
=
I can't even understand korean but I' am crying so hard rn
=
The emotions is real and they're voices blended well :( I love you bom
=
Bommie, seeing you cry during the ending of the song breaks my heart!! All the pain and struggles you’ve been through, Blackjacks and Bomshells know. We are so proud of how strong you’ve picked yourself up after such a hard fall! Thank you for coming back to us! Thank you for taking chances and risks! Thank you for not giving up on your dream! We will always always be here cheering and supporting you on!! Even though it may feel like you are standing alone like a scarecrow, just remember that your fans are always supporting you! We are always a part of you like how you are such a big part of us fans!!!! Thank you so much Hyojeong for partnering with our Bommie! You did such a great job! 💞
=
The water in my eyes broke. 😭😭😭 Park Bom Queen Forever. Bom and Hyojung Jjang!!!

=
Omg this is so sad 😭😭
=
Bom one of the few unique voices in loop.. indeed a queen 🥰
=
Im crying hard. 😭😭😭
=
어떡해ㅠㅠ봄언니ㅠㅠ우는거 보고 참았던 눈물 떨어짐,...나 원래 슬픈사랑노래 듣고 운적 없는데 이번 무대는 내 가슴을 울림.
=
These two ladies deserves millions of supports!
=
We love you bom 😭
=
2:49-2:53 is both my reaction.. When you combine it.
=
i can't stop crying! fighting park bom! 💖
=
Why im so tearful 😞
=
박봄 진짜 오랜만에 보는 레전드 ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ💗💗💗🇰🇷

ORIGINAL SONG BY - LEE HI
SING BY BOM AND HYOJUNG.


Scarecrow.


They say to me, “Why don’t you know –
That no matter what kind of love it is,
it all changes after time passes”
They say that even after 1 year,
things change from now
And that there won’t be any painful things then
But I know my heart very well
I know so well that it won’t change
Because everyone has a soul mate in this world
And that kind of love cannot be forgotten
You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can’t forget you like this
Like a scarecrow,
who stands alone even after everyone leaves

After the sun sets and everyone goes home
I am standing alone in a wide field
Little by little, I can’t see ahead
of me because of the darkness
It makes me more and
more afraid of being alone but
When I opened my tightly
shut eyes at some point
Beautiful stars were shining
Like the images of you,
who left far away
As I looked at them, I prayed that
you’ll come back to me some day

You may think that I forgot about you
You may thing that I am happy with someone else
But I still can’t forget you like this
Like a scarecrow,
who stands alone even after everyone leaves

You may think that I forgot about you
(oh, you may think that I)
You may thing that I am happy
with someone else
(forgot you)
But I still can’t forget you like this (I can’t forget)
Like a scarecrow, who stands
alone even after everyone leaves
(Even if you leave me, I’m like a scarecrow)

Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself
=
Don’t cry unni~
=
Bom... we all miss 2ne1... thanks for keep singing
=
Why why why? I wanna cry over this song. 😭😭
=
봄아 사랑해 ♥
=
its like watching BOM solo performance
=
예상대로 음원 안 나오네요 대실망 ㅠ 어떻게 좀 해줬으면 ...
=
오기를 빌었어 가사에서 눈물 살짝 고였는데 봄이 울자마자 눈물 나옴ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
허수아비....  예전  마이크...

간접적으로  맘을  어느 정도 알것 같네요
첨부터 감정에 가사를 표현하는것이 너무 힘들어보입니다

저까지 울컥하네요

지난온 날들 힘들었었어도 경험으로  생각하시고  행복하세요

응원합니다

삶이 다들 별로 틀리지 않아요
나름데로 누구나 스토리가 있고

저 또한  님의 노래로 위로를 받고있습니다
감사합니다 ^^
=
😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤
=
투애니원 생각나서 더 슬프다...지민이 눈물 날거 같다고 할때부터 진짜 계속 눈물 남...퀸덤 무대 중에 이번이 제일 간절했던 무대 같음
=
노래 너무 잘한다!!
=
😢😢😭😭😭 Eu n sei da linguagem delas eu n compreendi nada mas quase chorei tbm! POR FAVOR coloquem em legenda português!
=
Baby Hyojung 😭😭
=
눈물이나네요...
=
봄&쩡 앞으로 또 봤으면 밸런스가 안 맞는 조합이지만 그래서 색다른 매력이 있네요
=
외국인들 겁나 많아 ㅋ💗
=
효정에서 집중하면서 듣다가 박봄 나오자마자 소름 쫙 돋는다
=
That GREEN MIC. :(
=
아니 뭔 영어댓글밖에 없냐 ㅠㅠ한국인들아 빨리 댓달아줘.. 댓글보면서 노래들을려했더니 영어밖에 없따...
=
I'm crying...
=
朴春頭髮好長
=
저때 저곡 받고싶었는데 힘든 시간이었지...근데 한국인없어?
=
aww my bommie dont cry. everybody loves you. you're not alone. props to hyojung as well. she did really well. she's a perfect match for bom.  got nothing but respect for her. she's really admirable. thank you hyojung.
=
다들 영어를 잘하네...
=
the comeback of green microphone
=
Our Bommie cried.😭😭
=

=
Las mejores de toda la competencia.
Si señor!

=
Dont call yourself a true Blackjack if you didnt cried to this😭😭😭😭💘
=
효정 노래잘하는데 숨 마시는소리 컨트롤좀하면 더좋겟따
=
Can we have 2NE1 back? I think the world would be a better place with them together again
=
둘다 음색 최고다 진짜 봄앤쩡 사랑해요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
In the previous episode Bom said whe would sing this song rembering the hard times she have gone through... And after this perfomance you can see how much darkness she went through.
Time might pass but the love, support and respect we have for you Bom only grows every single day 💚💚💚💚
=
Hyojung looks so worry when Bom starts crying 😭
=
bom's voice is so touching i teared up
but why does it sound like she's holding back a cough, it makes my throat itchy lol
=
Green mic 😍😍😍😍
=
Is there anyone out in the world 🌎 who can just please give us 2ne1 back ? I wish someone could make it happen. Uggggh 😪, I am forever missing my CL, Dara, Minzy and Bom together 😪..
=
진짜 눈물난다 잘했다 둘 다
=
This was heartbreakingly beautiful. They sounded amazing together.
=
I keep torturing myself. I cried when BOM started to sing, I can't stop my tears. But I also can't stop repeating this song. Every time when I replay it, I keep crying. The tears just fell down. Park BOM is an sweet angel. The K-netizen ruined her all life. She doesn't deserve those hates. 😭😭
=
I just wanted Bom to win this show because she deserves so much. I confess I cried. :(
=
본방 보면서 같이 울음 ㅠㅠ 최고다 효정 봄
=
봄 ㅠㅠ 혼자 있는게 넘 와닿아서 그랬나봐 허수아비가사 내용이.... ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Hyojung with the emotional voice and Bom with the real experience makes this song magical😥😢💗!!
Agree?! 
👇
=
i don't understand the lyric, but I cried when I see BOM cried.
=
Park Bom is the vocal queen of KPOP
=

=
노래가 너무 처연하게 들림 ㅠㅠ
=
The way hyojung look at Bom is the same way like the whole BLACKJACKS look at our Bom
=
It hurts to see bommie  crying but I can't stop to listen to their song.. 😭😭
=
나 왜 눈물.... 둘다 너무 잘했음.....ㅠ
=
sorry .. that looks sincere when he sings only a few people. or just my feelings. 😅
=
Love the chemistry these two have. The way Hyojung supported Bom is beautiful! Love this due. Fighting BOM!!! 


PS - please add tearjerker warning to these videos XD
=
Goosebumps plus Im crying when she started to sing😓😭😢 I miss 2n1

=
I can't stop crying.. Boomie is on the verge of crying on the Duo part that's shy she cnt sing her part properly then she cnt bear it anymore in the end..I loveyou boomie PS dont cry
=
I love you BOM ! Kisses from Argentina
=
Bom cantas con ese sentimiento  que cada día necesito escuchar más de ti
=
Finally after so many years with only 2 biases Bigbang and 2NE1. Now Hyojung, Wheein, Eunji & G(idle) added to the list. love and support whoever collaborated with Bommie. 💚
=
Both did a great job...

😭😭😭😭😭
=
Ohh, i just hope hope hope that 2NE1 will perform there just like how they used to be as a star guest to help Bom. Himnaeseyo Bom!
=
Park bom still using green microphone 😭
=
I cry even i don't know the meaning of this song. YEAH ITS ME.
=
We will always love you Bommie 😘😘😘 you really made my cry. I hope Cl, minzy & dara would see this
=
Bom still using her green mic😢
=
Hyojung - my beloved leader. Her voice is actually wonderful and touches to the listener's heart. Also, her face makes me miss Soyeon T ARA a lot...I miss Soyeon. I'm crying...huhu
=
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ봄씨 행복하ㅅㅔ요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I cried a lot after watched this performance
=
keep fighting our bommie we love you
=
Park Bom she always leaves me speechless, her presentations herself convey a lot of feeling, I love her so much ㅠㅠ she deserves to win has gone through many ugly things, YOU HAVE ALL MY SUPPORT, good luck to all ♡
=
사랑해 봄앤쩡❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

=
ヒョジョンのほうが、感情がこもっている。

Bommie your voice transmits any emotion to the point of never forgetting it, you will continue infinitely in our hearts
#PARKBOM #QUEENDOM #MNET #BOMSHELL #BLACkJACkFOUREVER #2NE1 #HYOJUNG
Fighting!!! Fighting!!!
=
어떡해... 가사가 봄 얘기야
=
jin visual came out of nowhere and beat me up
=
Someone needs to sub the lyrics in. They are beautiful
=
Omg I cried when Park Bom cried and Hyojung's vocal was so good. And is Park Bom's hair really that long?
=
Pless bom dont cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
I CRYINNN :"((
=
My fav song 😭
=
진짜 짜증난다 투애니원 왜 컴백안해...
=
아 언니....    ,...
=
박봄 .. ㅠㅠ
=
As much as i love bom and you can feel the pain in this, i really think they shouldve chosen a song that wasn't so emotionally attached to bom. Her emotions unfortunately prevented her from doing her best. Yeah i cried since im a blackjack but i dont think it was fair for her partner to not be able to show their best. They are fantastic vocalists but the other performances outshined this one. I love seeing all the girls support each other so much in this show and seeing them all want to cry a little bit with bom means so much
=
싱크 무슨일이야.... 뭐하자는거야...
=
A song that was supposedly her song... With a lyrics that may be (?) what she feel at the moment..  that's why Bom cry... .. Park Bom you made us cry too!!!!😭😭😭😭
=
If this performance will not win, well, think there's something wrong with the program.
=
So emotional 😢😢😢
=
Lets support our Bommie!
=
Go beautiful and sexy voice of bom
=
I thought I wouldn't cry.. I was trying to resist not until the last few seconds where she gave in. I also gave in and started crying!!

Dearest Bommie, I know you miss 2ne1 and we also miss you as a group. But hang in there. We are here for you. We love you!! 💗💗💗
=
머리길이 보고 들어 온 사람
=
PARK BOM don't cry you make me cry too :(((

Hermosa canción
=
No subs needed. Everyone is speechless.
=
You r strong aister
=
둘 다 너무너무 조아하는 간순데 목소리 스타일이 너무 달라서 안 어울릴까봐 조금은 걱정 됐는데 너무 잘 어울린다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ최고야 ㅡㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Blackjacks cmon let's make it millioms
=
Wish I could give Bommie a hug. She and 2NE1 helped me through my hardest moments in my life. I would do anything to protect her. 😭
=
I read the lyrics while watching, and I find myselfs with tears falling from my eyes all throughout the song.they did that
=
This song is very emotional, it reached my heart
=
*BOMJJUNG♥️*
=
I'm at cashier table and now a little bit regret watching this park bom ....i'm crying..

true idol
=
All of Kpop fans and idols know what happened to Bom. This song is like her story: how she tolerated and how she got through by herself 😢 "Like a scarecrow, standing all by myself ". She deserves more !
=
What song is this cause I want to know what the lyrics are
=
박봄 목소리 창법 가사전달력 ,,, 곡의 감성이 너무 잘 전달되서 울면서 들을 수 밖에 없는 무대였어요😢🖤
=
honestly bom is just a precious gem that kpop lost... i was crying while watching her crying.... she can control your feelings and vibes
=
Baby don't cry park bom
=
It really hit hard on her 💔💔💔 I can’t stand seeing her cry but I can’t stop replaying this legendary performance. Congratulations Bom and Jung!
=
Park bom is an angel
=
When Park Bom started crying, I lost it 😢
=
don't cry
=
진짜 미안한데 용선누나 표정이왜 다 똑같은거 같지 다른 무대도 이 표정이던데



1:22 2:51 3:56 ㄱㄱ
두번째 세번째 연속으로 터치해도 완전 자연스러움
=
투애니원의 그리움 그리고 지금까지 힘들었던 마음..... 저도 진심 울었어요ㅠ
=
Mooooooore!!!
=
Don't understand but it's touches my heart
=
The fact that park bom suffered from something she didn't do always gets me. Knetz hated her and called her a lot of names for using medication she needed for her depression. With a very unsupportive CEO who refused to help her get out of darkness, her group suddenly disbanded without their consent, and to people judging her for her face. Bom is such a sweetheart and doesn't deserve all the hate she's receiving. As a BLACKJACK, this video is so heartbreaking. But i'm happy to see bom sing again and rise.
=
I have watched this video 4 times, I can't control my tears whenever I see it!!!
I don't understand what she sang, but my heart pains whenever I hear it😭😭😭
=
😢😢
=
쩡님♥목소리가 너무 섹시해요 ㅜㅜ
봄님♥목소리가 되게 새로워요!디박!
=
처음 박봄이 퀸덤에 나와서 You  and I를 부를때 나는 그 노래가 내 청소년기때 노래라서 눈물이 나는줄 알았는데 이제보니 박봄은 노래에 감정을 정말 많이 담아서 부를줄아는 사람인것같다 목소리가 사람의 심금을 울리는??그런게 있음 진짜 그냥 듣고있으면 눈물 줄줄나와 효정이가 못했다는게 아니다 음정도 정확하고 노래도 잘불렀고 박봄이 음정흔들릴때도 혼자 애드립까지 다 잘했는데 박봄이 워낙 독보적이라...
=
when I saw the green mic, tears started to fall 😭
=
저번부터 느끼는데 음향중에 박봄 싫어하는 애 있나 전부터 마이크 이상한거 같은데ㅅㅂ
=
효정도 노래 잘하는건 아는데
이건 박봄이 음색이 너무세서 효정이 너무 묻히는 느낌 ㅠㅠㅠ 아쉽다 효정 파트도 넘 적은것 같고 아무래도 파트너며 선곡이며 미쓰인듯,, 그냥 박봄무대 본느낌 ,,
=
Bom don't cry ... huhu
=
Stylist của park bom làm tóc với chọn trang phục cho park bom xấu quá 😭
=
Song name ?
=
발음 뭐이런거 다이상한데  뭔가 게속보게되네

그 어떤 사랑도 그 어떤 사랑도 시간이 지나면
변하고 마는걸 왜 난 모르냐고
1년만 지나도 지금과 달라져
내 생각에 아플 일은 없을 거라고
하지만 난 내 마음을 잘 아는 걸
변하질 않을걸 너무 잘 아는 걸
세상엔 정해진 짝이 다 있기에
그런 사랑은 절대 잊혀지지 않는 걸

너는 내가 널 다 잊은 줄 알겠지만
다른 사람과 행복한 줄 알겠지만
나는 아직도 이렇게 못 잊고 있어
모두가 떠나가도 혼자 서있는 허수아비처럼

해가지고 모두 집에 들어가면
넓은 들판에 나 혼자 서 있는 걸
앞이 조금씩 안 보이는 어둠이
혼자 있는 날 점점 두렵게 하지만
어느새 꼭 감은 두 눈을 떠보니
아름다운 별들이 빛나고 있어
멀리 떠난 너의 그 모습들처럼
바라보면서 언젠간 내게 오기를 빌었어

너는 내가 널 다 잊은 줄 알겠지만
다른 사람과 행복한 줄 알겠지만
나는 아직도 이렇게 못 잊고 있어
모두가 떠나가도 혼자 서있는 허수아비처럼

너는 내가 널 다 잊은 줄 알겠지만 (오 나는 내가)
다른 사람과 행복한 줄 알겠지만 (너를 잊고)

No comprendo el idioma pero se que al  oírla cantar a bom sentí ese sentimiento que quizo transmitir y realmente comprendí que fue duro para ella todo lo que vivió y lo  costó superar
=

I’m sure Hyojung’s father is proud and I’m sure Bom’s friend is proud. They both did great. We should get them #1
=
Anyone here crying as me when watching this?
=
Ma'QUEEN Park bom's emotion and feelings in this song are really true. She can really relate. It hurts
"I stand alone even after everyone leaves
Like a scarecrow."
=
For everyone who cheered up Bom after seeing her breakdown. Thank you very much from an International Blackjack. To Hyo Jung, thank you very much for hugging our Bommie. 💚💚💚 Cheering for #ParkBom and #HyoJung 🙌🙌🙌

=
I'm crying my eyes out while typing this gosh 2NE1 & BLACKJACK we've been through a lot. I can really feel the suppressed and frustrated feelings that Bom must have been felt these past few years being expressed here. Bom you are such a strong woman and we are so proud of you. Let's walk together on the flower road and pls God make 2NE1 happens again. Those ladies deserve better🙏🙏😭😭
=

=
Hyejeong sang beautifully and Bom sang amazingly but Hyejeong really need to improve her mic game
=
If this is not the #1 performance next week, I will see the whole Korea in court.
Park Bom, you are a freaking legend and I love you. Hyojung, you did incredibly well and you are so talented.
=
Yas queen
=
can i know this song name ? im cry
=
Bom crys
=
Bom一個人參加比賽很孤單
聽到這首歌，覺得好符合他現在的氛圍
希望名次好一點，不要再打擊Bom的信心了……
=
in my opinion, bomi shouldn't be in this show, knowing she is in a disadvantage position since she is the only soloist competing with groups and always getting the least votes. but im happy since she's getting back her confidence tru this show, it's just not ok for me to see her suffer and know that she wont win or maybe part of top 3 :(
=
Bom & Jung should be real tbh
=
If I could understand the lyrics, I bet it would be even sadder :((
=
O mundo não merece a BOM
=
봄 언니 데뷔때부터 팬이었는데 아직까지 언니 노래하는거 볼 수있다는것 만으로도 행복해요 화이팅 ㅜㅜㅜ 울컥하는거 보니 너무 맘아프다ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
Damn, that's a lot of offkeys
=
효정이란 분의 그룹은 어디인가요?
=
😍😍😘😘😘😘
=
허수아비 볼때 이하이보단 박봄이 더 좋지?ㅠㅠ 만약에 이하이가 이 곡 낸것보다 박봄이 이 곡을 냈으면 대박날것 같은디...
=
i love u bom
=
Park bom make me cry her voice is so touching
=
Name song????
