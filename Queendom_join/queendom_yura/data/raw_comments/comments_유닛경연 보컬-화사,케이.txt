solar looks like she’s gay panicking but the truth is... aren’t we all?
=
Hwasa: I just kinda wish you were gay~
Solar be like: O○O
=
"STAN TALENT, NOT POPULARITY."




PERIODTTT!!
=
kei: **raises eyebrows**
ppl: YA'LL SEE THAT?
=
Still surprised they sang this song since Korea is all censoring and conservative
=
Hwasa: *sings like an angel*
Kei: *also sings like an angel*
me: GOODNESS HELP ME THEY ARE STUNNING


EDIT: thanks for the likes!
=
Hwasa : "I just kinda wish you were gay"

Me : Oh, yeah i'm gay kiss me now please
😔❤️
=
Still cant believe they chose this song out of any other Billie eilish's songs. Wonderful
=
3:24 I’m So SORRY BUT SHE LOOKS SO LOST— SHE’s BEAUTIFUL DON’T GET ME WRONG BUT-
=
No one:

Park Bom:
👁️   👁️
    👄
=
why is everyone talking about kei and asking why no one is talking about her
=
**When you are a mamamoo and billie eilish stan**
=
Hwasa: breathes

Other idols : Omg I Iove her.
=
Kei and Hwasa: * sings *

My heterosexuality: IGHT IMMA HEAD OUT
=
I really liked Keis voice a lot on this cover.
=
Hwasa : "wish you were gay"

Everyone in the studio : already gay
=
Hwasa:I just want to make you feel ok
Humans: *dies*
=
Kei is so underrated, I love her to much, her vocals go so well with this song!
=
그냥 화사가 해석을 너무 잘해버림
=
Hwasa's talent, charisma, aura and everything is really admirable and all that but Kei amazes me here because i don't really listen to her (as well to her group) so her voice and presence shookt me like *so much* she's super amazing 😭😭
=
I adore this song anyway but Hwasa smashed it.
=
they did it for the lesbians everyone else go home
=
화사가 이 노래 진짜 찰떡이고 음색 좋은 것도 제스춰 표정도 다 타고난 것 같당 근데 개인적으로 케이를 잘 몰랐는데 이번 무대로 목소리를 재발견한 느낌. 뭔가 엄청 엄청 맑은데 깊은 물 속을 내려다보는 느낌!
=
진짜 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 화사는 내가볼때, 고작 사람인 우리 따위가 감히 평가하고 왈가왈부할 수 있는 존재가 아니야ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 사람이 노래에 소울을 담아 부르는게 아니라 소울이 사람 몸을 빌려서 현신하는 느낌이야;
=
Kei's ending gay ACTUALLY made me gay.
=
화사진짜 재즈찰떡...
재즈곡하나만 불러줫음..
=
no one:


absolutely no one:


YouTube: *BANGTANTV ALSO WATCHED THIS*
=
화사는 "너가.. 차라리 게이라면 좋겠어" 이 느낌이고
케이는 "그가 차라리 게이라면 좋겠어!" 이 느낌?
화사는 독백 느낌이 강하고, 케이는 제 3자에게 털어놓는 느낌이 강함

+)매우 주관적인 해석입니다!!
=
*i don't know Kei but she has amazing vocals and she's absolutely gorgeous*
=
hwasa even not trying 😂
she eat all cd's even she stole Billie's record and eat them 😂
=
Kei's voice is so angelic omg I can't breathe
=
Hwasa : Sing
people : arhhhh
Hwasa : walk
people : aaaaarrhhhh
Hwasa : show her hand 
people : aaarhhhhhh
Hwasa : 2:12
*everyone die*
=
Hwasa and Kei: *sings*
Everyone: omg *omg*
=
화사 솔로 커버버전도 궁금하네요 화사씨 음색이 정말 대단한것같아요 저렇게 녹여내는 가수는 처음봤어요..
=
화사 표정이 ㄹㅇ 독보적 몸짓 안해도 카리스마 있음.......
=
Kei: I just kinda wish you were gay
Me: That's what I'd like to say to you
=
아닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 케이랑 화사랑 반응 존나 다르네 케이 진짜 잘하고 나도 케이 좋아하는데 화사 진짜 넘사,,,,
=
When Kei first said “I just kinda wish you were gay” honwy, you don’t need to wish anymore. You already made me gay.
=
woah Hwasa's English pronunciation is pretty good considering she doesn't speak the language
=
*every female there and in the comments:* _gay panic_
=
The way kei raised her brow made my heart gayer than ever
=
퀸덤 보기 전에는 케이랑 화사 목소리가 잘 어울릴까 했는데 케이가 이런 목소리도 낼 수 있다는 걸 잘 보여준 듯
=
진짜 퀸화사ㅠㅠ 한소절부를때마다 너무느낌있어서 좋음ㅠㅠ  진짜못소화하는 장르?!가뭐지ㅠㅠ머리카락부터손톱끝까지 자기노래처럼부름ㅠㅜㅠ 화사언니 평생노래해주세요ㅠㅠㅜ
케이도 목소리 진하게쓰는곡 너무찰떡이다 개인앨범으로 이런거 하나해주면 좋겠다 당장사러갈듯ㅠㅠㅠ
그룹으로있을때는 서로 이렇게 목소리 잘 맞는지도 몰랐네ㅠㅠㅠ 이유닛 노래에서 나갈수가없어ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
화사가 너무 압도적으로 잘어울린다... 케이는 약간 좀 순하다
=
Who’s that girl in orange? Her voice is soooo beautiful and also her😍
=
I love everyone's so shocked with Kei's performance. Her collaborating with Hwasa was the best thing since Kei had a chance to not only try something new but also do it with someone who could really help her shine the brightest and i think it's beautiful
=
hwasa: -gasp-


me: THIS. this is the face i wanna see every day on my screen
=
Hwasa's voice and stage presence is seriously no joke. Wow.
=
순간 박봄표정과 내표정이 같다는것을 알앗다.....
=
Solar on Hwasa’s intro is like a proud mom ☺️ solar approved
=
화사가 정말 모든걸 홀리고 다니는 고혹적인 경험많은 언니 느낌이라면 케이는 처음 겪은 아픔을 표현하는 뭔가 성장할것같은 예쁜언니 아 개쥬악~~~
=
why is everyone talking about how no one seems to be talking about kei
=
If Hwasa is not a singer, for sure she's an assassin. I can't imagine how many of us is already dead by now after she stares at the camera just like that.
=
화사 곡 해석력 쩐당.. 너무 잔잔하고 좋아 ㅠㅠ
=
화사 음원 내주시기를 간곡히 바랍니다 눈물이 아주 찔찔 나오니까 브이앱에서라도 부탁드립니다
=
화사가 확실히 이런 노래에서 어떻ㄱㅔ 표현해야하는지 아는듯 ....
=
HwaSa: I wish you were gay

Me: I AM HWASA I LOVE YOU
=
Hwasa‘s fans here👇
=
와 케이 목소리가 이렇게 묵직하고 고급스러운줄 처음알았다
=
Title: Hwasa & Kei singing wish you were gay
Me: *the dreams come true :’3*
=
이번 노래 진짜 케이 목소리랑 너무 잘어울리고 너무 좋았음.. 뭔가 슬픔+애절함+체념이 섞인 기분이라..
=
“i just kinda wish you were gay”



I AM AND ITS BECAUSE OF YOU
=
THIS IS A GAYS ONLY EVENT GO HOME
=
Everyone beaing like "okay MAYBE I'm gay"

Me being lika "don't worry, I am"
=
keis voice perfectly fit the song and it just *chef kiss*
=
appreciate kei's performance too :( she's a whole goddess
=
케이와 예인이를 본 울림은 뼈저리게 반성하고 지난 과거를 잊고 새로운 러블리즈를 보여줄 수 있는 앨범을 당장 발매해라
=
Billie eilish must see this

👇
=
미치겟다 케이랑 화사음색 이정도인줄 몰랐음 제발 날 가져요 엉엉
=
와..
대박..
개인적으로 화사..완곡버전 듣고싶다. 
진찌 ㅠ
=
When Hwasa was like 

“ I’m so selfish “

Was I the only one that was like

“ THIS BEACH SUPPORTING HER HOMEGIRL MOONBYUL LETS GO “
=
two girls singing  the song : Ooo this shit be hitting different
=
every move hwasa does is a calculated move to make all straight girls gay and lesbians even more lesbian
=
If I was a girl and heard Kei and Hwasa say : "I wish you were gay..." I'd  be like:


Wish granted. Seriously.
=
Hwasa: I just kinda wish you were gay.

Everyone else: Ok then so be it 😭💖
=
the part when bom was looking at the performance speechless makes me feel sad because she's like the only artist that is solo here and everyone else are Groups
stay strong tho Bom
=
화사 목소리 무슨 일이야 진짜ㅠㅠ 첫 소절 듣는데 소름 쫙 돋았다 진짜
=
Ngl Hwasa is the reason I'm bisexual
=
케이는 너무 올곧게 하고 화사는 묘하고 느낌있게 잘한다
=
Kei and Hwasa KILLED this song
I'm inlove 
I'm so gay for them
=
Kei was awesome, her voice fit so well with any song...
=
Kei's "I can't tell you how much I didn't wanna say"

And Hwasa's "I just kinda wish you were gay"

*is actually the reason why we're all gay*
=
3:24 in this moment, i'm just like Bom, she's a real mood, omg
=
화사가
진짜매력이 많구나..반함!
=
두가지의 보컬의 조화가 참으로 감명깊은 무대였습니다. 그나저나 화사님의 음색은 참으로 흔치않긴하네용...케이의 음색은 언제나처럼 듣기 좋고 순수합니다. 두 분다 오래오래 사랑받을듯^^
=
화사는 솔직히 치트키니 더이상 말해봐야 입만 아프고.. 케이도 잘하네요 진짜.
=
I’m gay for hwasa she literally transport me with her voice I cannnnn’t
=
They are true singers! they are amazing!
=
"I just kinda wish you were gay"
me2
=
Why hwasa sounds so much like billie in my ears❤🔥
=
I was once a Lovelyz stan. But after seeing Kei like this. I am stanning them again. Ghad. ❤️ Hwasa also. ❤️
=
Hwasa needs to sing more Billie Eilish, she gave the song a little jazzy zing
=
Kei & hwase: I just kinda wish you were gay

Me: TAKE ME IM GAY
=
화사의 멋짐!  케이의 사랑스러움!  너무 좋은 무대였습니다!
=
뭐지 케이 음색 개좋다•• 노래랑 넘 잘 어울리는데??!!
=
I just realized Kei have a very beautiful voice.
=
really this song even exist? and they can sing in korean tv programme? i dont know that korean people so open nowadays.
=
Bomi was just like "Ok, Hwasa is my new wife" 😭
=
I'm looking forward to Kei and Hwasa's Blooming friendship 💕
I love how they look to each other HAHAHAHA
One is Introvert and One is extrovert that ended up Blending so well
=
케이 목소리를 너무 좋다❤
얼굴은 귀여운데 목소리는 성숙한듯
=
Hwasa be making everyone in the room gay  including me
=
화사만의 느낌이 있고 케이만의 느낌이 있어서 각자의 버전으로 들어보고 싶다 표현을 어떻게 해야 할지는 잘 모르겠는데 그냥 정말 각자의 음색 잘 살려서 부른 듯 둘 다 최고야...
=
When i watch my favorite cartoon in the morning:

 3:24
=
Y’all I’ve never heard of Kei before till now by some cruel twist of faith but you bet imma check her out
=
I'm not one of their fans, just randomly find this video, but... Kei's voice is amazing in this performance. Hwasa stage presence.... gives me goosebumps. Whoaa 👏👏👏
=
Hwasa needs to stop looking at the camera before she kills someone 😭
=
Bro I came out thx to Hwasa (the love of my life) so she singing this is so iconic omg I'm dead
=
*shows hwasa*
*me: gay panic*
=
2:55 that scene was magical 🤤 her voice!!!
=
I love how their voices together compliment each other; Hwasa's breathy yet textured voice with Kei's full one truly incaptivates the audience- including me omf
=
No one is talking about Kei, she did amazing. I love how her voice sounded low pitched than her usual voice.
=
is that really kei? oh my god ... im shooketh lol
=
이 영상 볼때마다 빌리같은 느낌이 든다 빌리랑은 다른데 뭔가 비슷한 느낌
=
3:23 my reaction 😂😭💘
=
가수 안했음 머했을까 싶은... 화사 무조건 흥해라!!!
=
화사는 진짜 가창력 다떠나서 표정 가창 제스쳐 이런 표현들이 타고났다 타고났어...그런데 라이브까지 되니 이건뭐;;
=
Who's still watching this and at the end realize how your impression look like solar 4:15
=
혼자보다 둘이 불러서 더 듣기 좋다... 화사ㅜㅜ 진짜 분위기,목소리,표정,제스쳐 너무 찰떡이어서 계속 눈길이 가고ㅠㅠㅠ 러블리즈 노래 들었을때 항상 느낀거지만 케이 목소리가 되게 성숙한 느낌이어서 이 노래랑 되게 잘 어울렸고 듣기 좋았음 ㅜㅜ 둘 목소리도 잘어울려서 같이 부르니까 시너지도 터지고 ㅠㅠ 이건 레전드임.......아직도 이 노래 생각나서 찾아온다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I really really love this performance. Hwasa showing her unbelievable vocals and Kei surprising everyone with her voice and visuals, wow.
=
The gays,including me: MY TIME HAS COME
=
This song fits Hwasa's voice so well. It's like buttah!!!
=
Personally i like Hwasa’s voice better but Kei’s voice is still so amazinggg
=
1:26 **kei's eyebrow raised** 
All of us 
"OMGGGGGGGG WKDKKSKSKD I CANT BREEATHEE **Screams**"
=
Kei’s voice in this song got me feeling some type of way 💕
=
No one in the audience was shouting for kei :(
=
Hwasa looks much prettier without those heavy eye shadows


Agree
👇
=
I personally fell for kei's voice and she's really looking so stunning 🖤
But i don't know why people in the comment are praising only Hwasa🤷‍♀️
=
케이: 탄탄하고  에쁜고
화사:  나나하고산상해
모두: 옴마야재좀봐ㅜㅜ
우기: 케이언니멋있당
사람들:  와아아 ㅏ ㅏ!!!~~
유아:  넘멋있어 ㅎㅎ
1등같아ㅜㅜㅜ
=
0:16 "i'm dead." 

same
=
Kei's "hey" made me feel some kind of way
=
Entertainment companies: Keeping idols in the closet
Hwasa: "I Just kinda wish u were gay"
=
3:24
mood.
=
“tHe sOnG dOeSnT sUiT kEiS vOiCe”

Oh please, can y’all just appreciate her effort considering the song isn’t her style but she managed to pull off another concept that is outside her comfort zone? Lovelyz is the most underrated girl group in this program, my girlies doesn’t deserve this kind of criticism.
=
nobody: 
solar at every queendom performance: 👁👄👁
=
I literally had goosebumps all over my body. Damn their voicessss
=
JUST THE FACT THAT MNET DIDNT CENSOR ANYTHING AT ALL
=
I need billie's reactION TO THIS!!-
=
케이가 진짜 놀랍다 퀸덤통해서 음색이 너무 멋지다 생각했는데 너무 잘불러..화사야 이런 노래 찰떡일것같았지만 너무 반전이야
=
I fell in love with Kei's Voice such an amazing effort and switch she did to suit Hwasa's part and the concept of the song ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
***Destiny Makes this beautiful biases reunite***
=
Hwasa’s voice is no joke <3
=
...와 진짜 화사는 이번에도 '화사'라는 장르를 이룩했네요 너무 찰떡이고 제일 멋져요 어떻게 저런 목소리가 나오고 음색이 저렇지...? 진짜 독보적.... 나른하면서도 저렇게 느낌 살려서 부르는 보컬은 화사가 넘사벽이다
=
LMAO i just love how the others reacting to this video are so amazed by the both of them~ 3:53~
=
they: singing
i am: totaly gay
=
Hwasa: I just kind of wish you were gay
Solar: :o
=
Best duo of 2019! ❤️🤧
=
HWASA IS THE REASON WHY I'M NOT STRAIGHT
=
Kei's voice was perfectly controlled. It was really good to listen to!
=
When this showed up in my recommendation i literally said "talk about twice"
=
3:49 I didn't expect that part 😂 I low key got scared
=
she mixed my two favorite things 
billie eilish
kpop
=
"i just kinda wish you were gay"

me looking at hwasa: well, i am now.
=
Baby, I don't feel so good
Six words you never understood
I'll never let you go
Five words you'll never say (aw)
I laugh alone like nothing's wrong
Four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us
One slipped away
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, mm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 'Heys' (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearing out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away (yay)
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
❤️
=
*OMFG i can't continue my normal life after this! This queens singing a perfect song of another gueen,Billie Eilish♡*
=
I love how they're completely rooting them on
=
THIS IS ILLEGAL IT'S TO PRETTY!
=
How many people want a studio version of this
⬇
=
Hwasa is so lowkey 
If you notice at tge last part where they sang i just kinda wish you were gay(?) hwasa supposed to sing it as well but she let kei took the stage 😢😢😢😢 
I stan hwasa so muchhhh😆😆😆😆
=
화사가 이 곡 전체 불러줬으면 좋겠다...
=
화사는 말할것도 없고~~
케이 목소리도 너무 매력있음
=
3:23 my face while watching this. <3
=
why is no one talking about Kei
 edit: when i commented this, it was when it just was posted so no one was talking about kei soooo 🤠
=
Billie: OH MY GODDD!!!!!!!!
=
I can't belive that they actually sing that song... bruh, I mean, Korea it's a super hater of lgbtq.






Kindda proud of this cover
=
화사는 진짜 원곡느낌잘살려서 잘부르고 케이는 음색 진짜 깔끔하고 잘부른다 ㅇ0ㅇ
=
I swear they’re a powerhouse omygod my heat ❤️❤️❤️
=
Hwasa:

Everyone: I STAN.
=
Bom’s cute💕💕
=
omg i'm so in love with this
=
THIS IS JUST THE PERFECT SONG FOR BOTH OF THEIR VOICES OMG THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
=
One of the best performances I've ever saw 🤯😢 Hwasa's voice 😭😭😭😭I'm okay 👌
=
Hwasa’s voice is just another level
=
i mean her voice is the same as billie's-
=
i love how they all became like a family
it's so cute
=
hwasa: exits
me: please osmgjdfj shess so gorgeous djjdkd I CAN'T JUST LOOK AT HERKDJDM SHE I- I'M HELDP ME
=
Hope they’ll stay friends. I love Kei now. Classic voice 🥰
=
Dear Hwasa,


You don't need to wish that I'm gay, I'm already gay for you


-Moomoos♥
=
I need hwasa full cover billie eilish's song "I don't wanna be you anymore"
=
Hwasa's voice is pure liquid gold. I'm gay panicking so hard right now
=
I'm surprised with Kei, where usually she was shown as Cute ..
But damn here she slays this along with Hwasa!
Love them
=
Me: *reads the title*
Me:..HUH?!
=
화사 나올 때 존나 아예 화면이 환기되는 느낌... 여기가 한국이 맞나 싶음
=
03:40 mood for Hwasa
Kei really did great here. I love her matured woman concept here.
=
This and Bom's team Perf. is my ultimate favorite❤
=
3:24 
i like how bom is just
vibing
=
i love to see my two queens like solar lookin at hwasa like that gives me goosebumps
=
화사 와 미쳤네 왜 다들 화사랑 유닛하려고 했는지 알겠다
=
а можно не вставлять реакций нам конечно всем очень интересно что там думают другие девушки, но люди вообще-то выступают
=
I love both Kei and Hwasa and I love seeing them both singing together.. Their vocals have different feel, color, range but both are so good ❤️
=
WOOAAAHHH!!! I LOVE THEM!!! THEY'RE THE VOICE TYPE THAT I LOVE THE MOST!!! 😭😭😭💙💙💙
=
Kei really needs to go solo!!!! Her amazing voice though!
=
Hwasa's "I'm so selfish" then that eye glare.... Me: Ya okay I'm gay
=
I relate to park boms reactions on a spiritual level
=
The way they performed this song was such a teeeeeaaaaaase oh my goooooooood
=
goosebumps all the damn time! this collab is lit af!
=
Me: No I don’t listen to Kpop the fandoms are c-
Also me: Lil did they know
=
Hwasa: "I just kinda wish you were gay."
Camera: *Turns towards Solar*
=
THIS GAVE ME THE CHILLS
=
EVEN KPOP IDOLS KNOW THIS SONG MY FAVES ARE SINGING MY FAVORITE SONG I AM SHOOK
=
I WANT THIS ON SPOTIFY ASAP
=
3:23 tho, boms reaction.
=
Hwasa really is a talented performer. I really think she could hit it in the US market.
=
먼가 원곡은 니가 게이였으면 좋겠어인데
이버전은 니가 게이여야만해 같어요
같은곡 다른느낌 다른해석👍👍
=
Holdup...

HWASA?







HWASA FREAKIN WHASA HWASA DID THIS EXCUSE ME WUD I DIDNT KNOW BUT I CAN TELL LES(BI)ANS ARE GOING CRAZY
=
and the goosebumps keep coming, such a masterpiece i love them!!! They complemented eachother really well.
=
Shipers be like:
=
케이 보컬 진짜 좋다! 엄청 성숙한 느낌임
=
i love it this collaboration, really.
=
hwasa:
everyone else: :OO
=
too much talent for me take at once😳💍
=
화사는 진짜 오진다 소름이다... 이런 노래 많이해줬으면좋겠음 어떻게 이러지? 표정 손짓 몸짓 눈빛하나하나 다 완벽하다진짜 와... 케이도 이렇게 힘있는지 몰랐었는데 잘한다
=
hwasa❤❤❤
=
I love Hwasa’s skintone
=
Oh my Hwasa...❤❤
=
My lesbian heart 😩💜
=
Wait does that sign thing on the screen in the back say f I n g e r s ... lmao
=
we just witnessed all those girls turn gay for hwasa
=
3:40 this person is me, this person is you, this person is all of us
=
빌리랑 화사랑 진짜 너무 좋아하는데 친구랑 퀸덤 보다가 화사가 빌리 곡 말하자 마자 소리질렀던거 기억난다 ㅋㅋ
=
와 화사 진짜 오늘 확실히 느꼈다 화사는 제발 미국이든 어디든 더 넓은 곳으로 갔으면 좋겠다 저 음색을 가둬둔다는건 말이 안됨 진짜...
=
3:24 omg kill me😂😂😂
=
This is so beautiful :')
=
HWASA VOICE MAKE ME SO thirsty. OH MY..
=
I never knew that I needed a duet with Hwasa and Kei until now. And I have to say this song was perfect for them. They sound really good together. I love Billie's version but I am now hooked on this one.
=
화사는 당연히 잘할거 알았고 케이는 본래 하던 스타일은 아닌데 잘 어울리네. 애초에 둘 다 실력이 좋아서 좋은 무대가 나온듯
=
*I never knew how much I needed this in my life until now*
=
3:40 thats honestly me with this video
=
Kei has such a powerful voice!! I'm so surprised.
=
I really want these two in a variety show!! ❤️ cutie pies! 🤗😍
=
Hwasa is such a perfect artist. She is always trying to make everything look perfect for her stages. She's a singer, a writer, a composer, a rapper, a performer. She is just perfect. Honey vocals and unreal stage presence. A REAL QUEEN.
=
Hwasa❤️
=
Kei, sweetie, if you're reading this right now, I love you! Really Love your vocal. No, not just that, i love everything about you!😭💘
=
they are reacting to every move lol
=
와 화사 진짜 미쳤다,,,너무좋음
=
화사 그녀는 왜 저기 여자들을 다 꼬시고 있는가...
=
HWASA MY QUEEN
=
They both did so amazing and honestly I fell in love with them even more, this was my favorite from the singing unit 🥰😍😍🥵
=
This just turned my gay 🦄🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
=
1:03 
When u realize hwasa is queen
=
Hwasa will go down in history for being every aspiring female Kpop idol's role model
=
HWASA MY LOVE YOU'RE SO AWESOME MY LOVE
=
I need Billie Eilish to REACT to this!
=
me encuentro: enamorada
=
I am a Hwasa's fan, but I liked the Kei's parts more
=
Solar's face at the end was so funny. She was really stunned by her own group members i guess 😂 and of course kei as well
=
I love the performance but the others ruined it with their over the top reactions
=
GOD ITS HWASA AND MY FAVOURITE SONG
=
Kei you're absolutely amazing I love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
If you like Mamamoo, raise your hand. If you don’t, raise your standards. 🙋🏻‍♀️
=
i love how hwasa n mamamoo can play on stage lyk wow
=
HWASA you are amazing, that stage presences 🥰
=
oh my god... i have goosebumps every time Hwasa sings!
=
I can't breathe through all their perfomance it's been 4 nd a half mins. So... i guess now, I'm in heaven.🌌" wish you were gay"🙏🙋
=
Hwasa: breathes

Camera zooms, crowds scream, girl groups topple, earthquake rumbles
=
they look like goddesses <3
=
Hwasa's voice is so addicting 😍
=
Loved Kei's voice here
=
I guess people thought if they dislike the video enough Hwasa & Kei would loose!! Well it's not a popularity contest, but a talent contest, and that's exactly why they came in at #1 - TALENT !!
=
honestly tho, i cant just listen to this song once....its more like 10 times on repeat. i wish they would put it on spotify and stuff ugh
=
Billie, come here :') <3
=
_Hay que esperar a que Billie lo vea_
=
I fell in love
=
Hwasa “im so selfish” = EVERYTHING TO ME
=
2:55 hwasa sounds exactly like billie
=
Ok I just heard of kei but GODAMN she's amazing ajsbasjaja 😍😍😍
=
진짜 소름돋음 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
MARAVILHOSAS 💓🌟
A voz da Hwa sa me arrepia, linda demais
=
Hwasa: *breathes*

Me: Hi I'm gay-
=
Kei is amazing, she just made me gay
=
WHO ARE THEY OHMYGOD THEY SLAYED THIS SONG
=
hwasa: i just kinda wish u were gay
me: i already am hun
=
"We are Gay-Pop"
=
Hwasa lowkey announcing here that she's gay
=
Ahhhh hwasa my queen ! This song suits her 💕❤️💕
=
i need to stan mamamoo now
=
Thought I loved these girls before but they just keep coming with fire! Make me fall harder every time
=
There is me "wish you were kei"
=
화사 노래 부를 때마다 사람들 와... 하는 것부터가 화사가 장난 아니란 걸 보여준다ㅠㅠㅠ 케이도 음색 곡 분위기랑 찰떡이야ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
OMG, Hwasa :(((((( amazing voice
=
3:24 Bom looked entranced XD
=
2:10  -  Hwasa is the Elvis of Kpop!

=
Stan hwasa! ♡♡♡
=
Orgasmic. 🔥❤
=

Hwasa's voice feels so heavenly...awww im in love😍🔥
=
화사 진짜 대박 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 원래 잘하면 와아아악!! 이러는데 진짜 너무너무 잘해서 와... 와 진짜.. 와.. 이렇게밖에 감탄이안나옴
=

=
solar: 👁👄👁
=
hwasa: breathes


me: omfg hwasa marry me
=
Hwasa needs a collaboration with Billie Eilish!!!!
=
3:24  -  Bom is in awe and has so much respect for Hwasa and Mamamoo, and vice-versa.
=
케이는 느낌있는 대로 부르는것 같고 화사는 느낌가는 대로 부르는 것같다..







(결론은 둘다 잘부른다♡♡♡)
=
1:02
tbh same
=
OMG HWASA’S “I’M SO SELFISH” JUST GIVE ME GOOSEBUMPS
=
Hwasa❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
Daaaang Hwasa has such an amazing voice, likeee OMG <3
=
3:24 Park Bom just looks so done with their voices hahahah
=
3:25 period.
=
Hwasa should make a full cover of this , it fits her alot. Her range is incredible , she can do soft , sexual , strong , badass everything. Love her.
=
¡Hwasa is so Beautiful! ♥️♥️
=
Ok so it's mamamoooo XD
=
*This is the video I'm gonna watch just to reconfirm that I am lesbian*
=
the girl's eyes at 1:03 startled me so much
=
화사는 진짜 여왕같은 느낌이다,,, 노래 부르는데 소절소절마다 그냥 여유가 넘쳐흘러
=
I love the voice of the first
=
3:24 lmaooo🤣🤣
=
mY FAVORITE SONG WITH MY FAVORITE GIRLS GROUP HJDRXHGJ
=
Hwasa voice OMG 😘😍👌🤤🔥
=
화사 진짜 미친거아닐까..... 첫 소절 부를때부터 노래 끝날때까지 화사만 보면 감탄연발...... 음색은 말할것도 없고 저런 표정이랑 몸짓이랑 무대매너는 대체 어디서 나오는건지....... 가수 하려고 태어난 사람같아......
=
Omg the way she said gay at the ending gave me  
c h i l l s
=
I got goosebumps from how good this sounds
=
queens, I'm in love.
=
아... 진짜 화사는 진짜다...

Hwasa's voice make me 👼
=
Reactors need to react to this
=
화사 대박
=
Can someone ask hwasa for me how it feels to be God’s favorite
=
화사 진짜 신이 어떻게든 운명을 바꿔놔도 결국엔 가수 했을듯.. 그렇지 않고서야 저 음색 가창력 제스쳐 센스 그냥 나오는 게 아니다... 독보적이다 화사...
=
화사 ㄹㅇ 커버해주면 좋겠다 ㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 음색 넘 잘어울려
=
Woah Hwasa looks gorgeous here 😍😍😍😍
=
LOL their reactions

=
El empoderamiento de sus voces es increíble
=
화사는 알고 있었는데 케이 이런 노래 왤케 잘해 나 진짜 처음 봄 상상도 못 함
=
Park Bom so cute ❤️ i love her very much
=
It's because of hwasa that's why I clicked
=
I love Kei's voice. But I can't get over the face being made at 3:23. Don't come for me. I'm just here because I like Billie Eilish and K-pop.
=
케이씨 이런 매력이 있으셧네!!!!!!
=
연예인들 화사 무대 보고 덕후처럼 앓아ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 화사가 쩔긴 쩐다
=
3:25 박봄 너무 귀여운거 아니냐ㅜㅜㅜ
=
omg the ornage dress sister sings awesome mostly like billie
=
literally every girl is gay after watching this performance you can't change my mind
=
아닠ㅋㅋㅋㅋ이 언니는 노래부르랬더니

=
아니 나 솔라 표정 리액션이 왤케 좋지ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 다른 사람들은 크으~캬아~ 아악~~ 하고 있는데 솔라 혼자 (정적)(경악) 하고 있음ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ큐ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Wow these girls are so supporting. They're fangirling like me. Isn't that how everyone should beeeeeeeeee  😍
=
Damn, this is so addictive !!!  Kei is so cool. They slayed it hard.
=
Bom's face 😂😂
=
김케이 미쳤다ㅠㅠㅠ 언니ㅜㅜ😭❤
=
Never thought I'd hear a song like this sung on Korean television omg... Im dead.

Mukanya 3:25
=
never imagine how kei will be had that hwasa style..
=
Hwasa, i really wish u were gay ):
=
나 케이가 넘 좋다 ㅠㅠ
=
솔직히 둘이 음색이나 분위기가 너무 달라서 안 어울릴줄 알았는데 너무 잘 어울림.. 일단 무대 뒤에서도 둘이 거의 우결찍는 중ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
마지막에 케이 아이저스트 컨다 위슈 월 케헤에...이
=
오우야 화사 어후 오늘부터 팬됐다 너무 좋네
=
Kei and hwasa’s Performance is Amajing!!
#BillieFanHere
=
3:40 sis same ☺️😌
=
케이님 목소리 완전 힘있는거 처음알았거 화사님은 진짜 그냥 개간지..그냥 하나하나 간지나요..
=
Aww! Solar's reaction. <3
=
케이는 정말 그대로 한국 아이돌이 커버한 것 같은데 화사는 고냥 외국 가수 같애ㅠㅠㅜㅜㅡ♡♡♡
=
Kei: I just kinda wish you were gay

Me: Well I just mig...*runs into closet &jumps out* Hi~
=
I'm loving this too much!!!
=
I'M LITERALLY GAY FOR HWASA LIKE THERE'S NO DENYING THAT LMAO
=
i love the way kei say the word "sexual orientation" ..soooo sexaayyyyyyy
=
3:24 mood ( BOM IS SO CUTE )
=
Bom's resting face makes my day...
wkwkkw
=
AHHHHHHHHHHHH! BILLIE EILISH'S SONG! 😍💞
=
원곡을 아는사람으로 화사... 그루브가 대단하다 발음도 가성도 음색도
=
Imagine hwasa's voice with minnie's ugh
=
not gonna lie I love Kei but I want Hwasa to cover the full song by herself and put it on spotify lol
=
Mamamoo always smashing it
=
Hwasa aaaaaaaaaaaa ! love you so much!! love your voice so much ~~~
=
As expected from Hwasa. She's not selfish. She even let kei to shine and discover another part  of her. She get the best out of kei and taught her techniques. Seldom see that to other artists bcoz they all just want to stand out.
=
내 발음 자막 영상을 보다 여기까지 와버렸당 ㅋㅋ 화사 음색 정말.. 여느 해외 가수 못지않게 섹시하다,, 케이도 이런 모습 처음 봤는데 대박인 듯•• 빌리 팬으로서 잘 보고 간답니당
=
화사언니 ㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 너무 좋아요 몰라 
멋지면 다 언니 잖아 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜ 
진짜 맘무 다 사랑하지만 화사는 독보적입니다 팝감성 다 박살 내버림 ㅜㅜ 전세계가 알아야해!!!!
=
I'm already gay, it's okay😂
=
The way Hwasa looked at Kei at the end... :D
=
Kei is like: mom I'm goth and gay now, you can't stop me
Edit: so much likes oh gosh
=
i love the bi theme going on in the background
=
*Queen Hwasa is sooo damn fine hELp*
=
if youtubes demonetises this ima throw fists
i honestly cant i-
=
Omg mamamoo and billie eilish
=
Hwasa: wish you were gay
Me: *I* *AM* *GAY* *FOR* *YOU*

WHO'S WITH ME?
👇🏻

EDIT:THANKS FOR THE LIKES
=
Omdys everytime Hwasa performs, I act like this is the first time I'm realising how amazing she is. As if my YouTube history isn't full of mamamoo's and Hwasa anything videos 😪😪
=
화사 풀버전 듣고싶다 ㅠㅠ
=
화사언니 밀당 장난없어요ㅠㅠ 너무좋아진짜 목소리가 그냥 예쁘장한게아니라 진짜 이노래 자기얘기처럼해준다❣
=
I thought it was moonbyyuull :'(((( great performance though😍😍
=
I'm annoyed no one cheered at Kei's parts! She was so good!!
=
I'm inlove with hwasa now.
=
I need Hwasa full cover version!! Her voice is sooo soothing!!
=
하 진짜 너무 좋아 ㅠㅜㅠㅜㅠ 오늘만 20번 넘게 본거 같아 ㅠㅜㅠㅠ 제발 멜론이나그런데 올려주세요 제발 .....
=
Kei did a reallyyyy good job 👌💯
=
케이야..너가 해냈어 ㅜㅜㅜ 너무 감동이야 성장했어
=
Cant get over this performance...im so in love with 95
=
Why isn't no one taking about keiii she did amazing too

Biased asses or some

Nyways both of them did well uwu
=
damn😳♥️
=
PLS I LOVE THIS SO MUCH I CAN"T STOP WATCHING
=
"how am i supposed to make you feel ok?"

me watching hwasa: I AM NOT OK
=
맨날 보러옴ㅜㅜ 케이 노래 넘 잘 불러ㅜㅜ
=
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I WISH I DIDN'T WANNA STAY
=
We love representation!! Lol
=
What group is Kei from because omg she is amazing and Hwasa omg i love you😂
=
화사가 노래만 불렀다하면 사람들 감탄사가 ㄴㄱㅋㄱㅋㅋㄲㅋㄱㅋㅋㄱㅋㄲㅋㅋㄲ갓화사
=
Hwasa is the mother of coolness . WOW 🥂👍
=
That eyebrow got me dead
=
me after seeing a female idol:
=
뭔가 화사 빌리아일리시 노래 커버 하면 잘어울릴듯ㅜ
=
화사 표현력 미쳤고 케이는 자기의 틀을 깨려고 노력한게 보여서 좋다ㅠ
=
Kei reminds me of Jisoo:'}
=
I think the one in orange literally killed it
=
화사 솔로 버젼 보고싶어...
=
보면서 우기 나오는데 너무 고양이처럼 똘망똘망하게 보는 거보고 귀여워요
=
Hwasa stunned me. Like she not only delivered the song right, she actually digested the song well, the notes and lines obv, but also the vibes and atmosphere it holds. On top of that, she delivered it in her original way, so effortlessly. 
I'm turning gay for her like please.
=
muito bom!❤
=
Billie NEED to see this...NEED
=
i just wish billie saw this...queen sang her song.....its soo goooddeu,..~~~
=
Hwasa and Kei are a perfect pair. And their friendship was very cute ❤❤
=
Hwasa : breath 
Other idols: woooooooow mochisso😂😂😂😂
=
HWASA: SUCH A PRO😍
=
화사 I'm so selfish 미쳤냐...뭐야
=
Kei ❤️ I love you
=
화사가 너무 사기캐다...
=
Kei: “I just kinda wish you were gay”

Moonbyul: “Back off bish, that one’s mine”
=
Wow my favourite female K-pop singer singing my favourite pop singer's song! I'm dying❤️ Hwasaaaaa!!
=
they're so perfect together, omg
=
Wow these vocal queens!!
=
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA MEU DEUS TO BERRANDO!!!!
=
케이가 애교 진짜 다 내려놓고 무대 올라갔네. 노력많이한거같다 고생했네
=
3:24 is how we all looked watching this video bruh
=
The both of them are pure gold ❤️
=
Hwasaaaaaaaaaaa 😍
=
I had to replay this video two times because I wasn't over their amazing vocals
=
근데 지금 생각해보니까 케이 맘도 이해가 조금은 간다 나이도 어느정도 있는데도 항상 무대위에서 애교부려야하고 윙크하고 청순청순한 컨셉들로 거의 해왔으니 저런 성숙한(?)무대도 해보고 싶었을듯
=
화사버전 나왔으면 ㅜㅜㅠ
=
K-Pop + Billie Eilish = Perfection
=
2 beautiful women singing an lgbt+ song??? this is crazy i love it
=
hwasa my QUEEN stop stealing my wig after every performance 😤
=
와... 화사는 진짜 가수안하면 뭐하냐 음색 미쳤다
=
화사 음색 톤 개미쳤누........ 언니......... 
ㅇ <-< (사망사유:화사
=
와..씨
미쳤다 진짜로 화사언니 븨앱에서 이거 한번만 불러주세요 그럼 언니의 영원한 무무(노예)가 될께요ㅠㅜㅜ
=
Kei's voice is beautiful!
=
Hwasa: I just kinda wish you were gay
Me: is that for whee in? Lol
=
Hwasa's low notes harmonizing at the end reached down and elevated my soul.

Kei's tone turned out so nice. I haven't listened to her before this but judging from the practice, she is quite out of her comfort zone and is doing rather well. Kudos to her!
=
화사 미쳤다 그냥 혼자해두 되긋다ㅋㅋ
=
I didn't know Kei but she has an amazing voice alongside with Hwasa, both gave an outstanding performance.
=
Want full version of Hwasa 
Fell like OMG 😮 what’s? Y I really love it 😍
=
*0.00 sec gave me goosebumps 😍*
=
we cant deny hwasas charisma is on another level
=
케이랑 화사도 진짜 너무너무 잘하고 잘 어울렸는데  화사랑 민나랑 만났으면 어땠을까...완전 궁금해....
=
YALL THE HARMONIZING OF HWASA AT THE END IS JAHDHDHDBBX
=
와...... 진짜 목소리가 너무 잘 어울리고 노래도 너무 좋은데 두 분의 음색이 노래에 잘 스며들었다..
=
화사는 정말 느낌도 잘살리고 음색도 너무 좋고 잘 불렀고 케이도 생각보다 허스키한 목소리도 잘 어울렸음 ~ didn't wanna stay 잘부른듯 화사랑도 케미 좋고 진짜 1등할 무대였음
=
화사는 일단 음색이 미쳤는데
그 음색을 더 간드러지게 만드는 바이브레이션이랑 발성(?)이 너무 좋음
맛깔나게 부름 그냥
꼭 무슨 옛날 미국에서 마릴린 먼로 유명할때 유행했던 노래 부르는것 같은데 세련됨;
=
I JUST WANNA MAKE YOU FEEL OKAY
=
Hwasa: *exists*


Every kpop idol liked that
=
felt like nothing then this popped up and all my emotions gushes out to form the embodiment of everything lesbian
=
Woah!! Park Bom is so cute! ❣️
=
화사 진짜 독보적이다...여아이돌 중 거의 유일하게 화사만 소화하는 컨셉 진짜 와...케이랑 화음 이렇게 좋을줄 몰랐음 거의 케이 목소리를 휘감는 느낌 캬
=
Music of my love life.
=
2:53 지려버리는 음색ㄷㄷ
=
제발 화사only 버젼 음원 내주세요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Hwasa's voice WOW no words 👑💕
=
와 케이 목소리 진짜 고급지다...
=
역시..
마마무보컬 암나 데려다놔도 이런반응 나왔을거임
=
are we automatically gae by watching this


nevermind *we are*
=
화사가 빌리한테 노래 뺏었는데?ㅋㅋㅋ 왤케 잘해 미쳤으
=
Can I take Hwasa home? Thanks ❤️
=
Aren’t we all gays for mamamoo
=
BOTH OF THEM ARE SO AMAZING
=
화사버스 부릉부릉 난 치였지..
=
내가 좋아하는 두명이서 같이  😱
=
KEI SNAPPED 
PERIOD
=
Idk but Hwasa has that Katniss everdeen vibe
=
At the end

"i just kinda wish you were...


gAaYyY~
=
민니가 이 노래를 같이 했다면 음색 장난 아니였을텐데
=
케이 ♡♡♡ 화사 ♡♡♡
온몸에 소오름 돋았다아~~~
=
Kei (Kim Jiyeon 김지연) is four months older than Hwasa (Ahn Hyejin 안혜진).
They are so different to each other in personality, but this duo really works superbly together. Both women are outstanding role-models and fabulously talented. Hope they remain friends after Queendom concludes.
=
다 잘했는데 이 무대는 솔직히 진짜 넘사벽이었다...... 화사 노래는 말할 것도 없고 무대 매너부터 그냥 다 사기...
=
와 화사님 원곡이랑 진짜 비슷하다...케이님도 음색 깡패..
=
Ahh i wanna hear the full song from hwasa.. her voice is just gold! 🥰
=
HWASA YOURE GAY 🔥🔥🔥
=
OMG the bridge is so good
=
No other idol has the stage presence that hwasa has. In fact all the members of Mamamoo has very different charms and that's why they compliments each other so much.

I never thought that Kei would sing so better. I think hwasa really did make a good choice. And I never heard this song before but I feel I need to download this one. ❤️❤️🎶😂😂
=
0:26 우리의 표정
=
The female support for each other here is amazing, there's just something about females supporting each other and just every thing about this is wholesome 💛💛💫
=
Kei voice 🥴🥴 💞
=
When you are MAMAMOO fan and also Billie :333333
=
캐이가 그렇게 화사한테 매달렸는지 알겠다.. 식스센스에서 파합으로 본실력은 그냥 저평가 받았는데 일단 화사 목소리로 치트키 들어가면서 잘 어울린데다 실력 이상을 보여준듯 둘 다 너무 잘한다 식센때 너무 욕먹어서 안타까웠는데
=
와 진짜 케이 목소리 너무 좋다...
빌리노래는 어울리기 ㅈㄴ 어렵던데
=
i have to watch this at least once a day😌
=
YALL KEI'S VOCAL REALLY SERVED IM FALLING 💕💕💕💕😥😣
=
As usual MMM being a MMM, Hwasa command the stage.
=
보컬 승리 팀은 개인적으로 여기인 것 같습니다
=
0:26 Solar face,  is like this is my babe. Pround unnie
=
HWASA QUEEN 💜💛💚❤💙
=
kei 화이팅♡♡
목소리 죽인다 ㅠㅠ
=
케이도 잘했는데... 민니랑 화사랑 같이 이거 부르는거 진짜 보고싶었는데...ㅠㅠ
=
케이 보컬에 힘 넣고 여성스러움을 좀 빼니까 개쩐다.... 아이돌이라는 이미지에서 벗어나서 이런 스타일로 더 불렀으면 ㅜㅜ
=
화사 걍 존나 완벽하고 케이도 이 노래랑 너무 잘어울려..목소리 둘다 미쳤따
=
화사는 정말 미친듯!
=
2.55 is my favorite part 😍😍😍
=
I’m gay for her-
=
케이 목소리...진짜 너무 신기함 어떻게 자랗게 풍요롭게 청초하지
=
i love kei's voice
=
THE WAY KEI SAYS "GAY" MAKES ME GAY
=
그래도 원곡이 젤 좋다ㅋㅋ
=
4:07 이 부분 누가 파트 실수한건가?
=
케이 목소리가 얇은줄로만 알았는데 이 노래를 통해서 힘있는 목소리라는 느낌
=
아녜진 너무 소중하고 아름다워
=
화사버전 음원 내주세요ㅠㅠ
=
OMG LMAO IN THE BACKGROUND THERES A PICTURE OF A MINECRAFT CREEPER
3:31
=
I see a different Kei and I am loving it 😍
=
케이 저번에 연습할때 발라드 창법 남아있다고 화사랑 같이 연습한 부분 있었는데 진짜 바뀐게 느껴진다.. 그 때보다 훨씬 곡이랑 잘 어울림
=
the Kei vocal's is so incredible and she sing's so good
=
i'm----💓💞💕💗💞💖💗💖
=
민니랑 화사랑 했어도 좋은 그림이 나왔을거같다ㅏ😍
=
I'm gay for you hwasa♥♥
=
Everyone knows Hwasa is the queen, always a great performer n she delivers the emotion very well. But Kei really suits the song n completes each other. N How Hwasa gave tips n let her shines is just love!! Her passion channels to right way
=
화사버전 음원좀... 시급합니다....맘팁 듣고잇나
=
You just made me gay, Hwasa.
=
Billie Eilish fannnsss 🖐💚
=
CAN WE HAVE FULL VERSION OF THEIR OWN, HWASA WITH FULL AND KEI WITH HER FULL VERSION😭😭
=
진짜 이렇게 노래하는 거에서 왜 마마무 마마무 하는지 알거같음.. 화사개지려 ㄷㄷㄷ
=
1:03 honey noooo

THAT GIRL IS A WHOLE MOOD OMG 3:40 
SAME, SIS. SAME.
=
omg hwasa🙂 i already gay bcs of you
=
I'M HERE BEACAUSE OF BILLIE EILISH SONG HOPE ALL HAHAH
=
화사 나올때마다 가수들도도 거의 앓네ㅋㅋㅋ  화사가 도입부 시작하자 마자 진짜 저절로 감탄사가 계속 나옴. 음색, 감정 표현, 보컬 테크닉, 제스쳐 모든게 가수 하기 위해서 태어난 사람처럼 너무 잘한다.
=
At the moment all those idols watching were definitely gay
=
kei 목소리 존예
=
I DIDN'T KNEW HWASA SANG WISH YOU WERE GAY JWBDJWBD
=
카이는 한올한올 정성으로 부르고 화사는 노래를 느끼면서 흐름대로 부르는 느낌이라 신기하네요
=
케이가 1차, 2차 경연 때 어울리지 않는 컨셉변화로 안좋은 말을 들었지만 이번에는 잘 녹여든듯
=
Goosebumps game going strong
=
음원 안나오나요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 혜진이와 케이님의 Wish you were gay 음원 내주세요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
케이 소름...
=
Kei's voice is stunning wow
=
역시 동갑내기인가..? 둘이 호흡이나 음색이 너무 잘맞는다.. 마마무 화사는 역시 화사했는데 케이를 보고나니까 전에 보여준 컨셉들보다는 이런 성숙한 컨셉이면 더 좋지 않았을까 라는 생각.. 예인과 케이를 보니까 컨셉만 잘잡았으면 더 좋았을걸 하면서 전 두무대가 괜히 아쉬워진다..
=
역시 안혜진👍👍👍
멋진 아티스트😄
=
민니 화사 했었어도 대박일것같은데...ㅠㅜ
=
A Hwasa and billie collab please 🙏🏻
=
둘 다 너무 잘 부르는데 서로 음색이 안 어울리는 느낌...? 두 명 다 독무대로 보고 싶다
=
I noticed hwasa didnt line her eyes that much here, so much it looked like she's not wearing any makeup.. I like it!
=
From the thumbnail the other girl looks like seulgi omg... thought this was a fake vid 💀
=
3:56 Please tell me who she is-  I want to stan
and 
4:16 (I think it's Solar from Mamamoo but I'm not sure?)
=
you make me feel helpless
=
They both did amazing.  I love how soulful Kei's voice is. 💜
=
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 화사가 한소절 부를때마다 사람들 엄청 좋아하네
=
화사가 너무 넘사벽...
=
I'm gay for HWASA.
=
화사💋
=
미쳤어ㅡ.. 맨날 보러 와
=
화사 진짜 한 소절 한 소절마다 진짜 감탄밖에 안나온다 진짜 소름돋아서 오그라들어서 말린 오징어되겠음;;;;
=
God is Hwasa 💖💖💖
=
Who came here just because you saw Billie Eilish because I did 😂
=
둘 다 개잘했다 진짜 ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 조합 오져
=
첫소절에서 끝났다
=
와 진짜 개쩐다는 말밖에 안나옴 ㅠㅠㅠ 사실 둘이 이미지도 음색도 정반대라고 생각해서 잘 맞을까 걱정도 했었는데  화사는 뭐 늘상 잘하고... 케이는 진짜 놀랐다... 이렇게 잘하는지 몰랐다... 음색도 너무너무 예쁘다 ㅠㅠㅠ 둘이 음색도 잘맞는것 같고... 천년만년 내 맘에 품을 무대...
=
노래선곡미쳤네ㅋㅋ노렸니
=
the guy in 2:06  looks like hes about to change bias lmao (or he already has hwasa as his bias)
=
This is...making me gayer...and I love it
=
0:15 X같다 X같다
=
뭐 화사는 원래 분위기 남다른거 알고있었지만 케이야말로 지난 파압 사태를 잊게하기 충분한 실력과 바이브였다 (러블리즈 팬아님
=
im so gay omg the eyebrow raise omf
=
Me after this performance.
Me(to my gf) - I just kinda wish you were kei.


P.s- lel sorry i dont have a gf tho.
=
That's it I need a sub unit with them two together
=
I don’t know who these two are but I’m about to stan
=
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ케이 완전 정말 지독하게 상대 앓다가 애원하는 느낌이고 화사는 나른하게 너 있어도 없어도 그만이긴 한데 좀 아쉽긴 해 왜 난 안 돼? 같다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 음원 나오나요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 케이한테 이런 면 있는지 첨 알았음 아니 이렇게 잘하면서 왜 그랬던 거야ㅠㅠㅠ 눈썹 찡긋도 잘하면서ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
So impressive!
=
Omg hwasa!!! Why are you doing this to us!😭
=
omg why am I feeling so gay now
=
park bom really said 👁👄👁 the whole time
=
왜 그렇게 화사에 열광하나 했는데, 퀸덤 보면서 확실히 알게 되었음. 화사는 그냥 멋을 가지고 태어난게 분명하다. 의도안해도 멋이 뿜뿜 새어나오네
=
3:25 and 4:15 same sister,same 😯😯
=
I love this song because it's cool and go to Billie Eilish. ❤
=
3:25 me.
=
원곡보다 이게 더 좋은데 다운을 못받아
=
화사는 진짜 타고남의 대명사인 것 같다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아이돌이고 뭐고 그냥 넘사야 미쳤어..... 또 이 무대가 재밌는 건 케이가 왜 김밥으로 화사 꼬신지 충분히 알겠다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 솔직히 케이는 잘 몰랐는데 생각보다 너무 잘 어울리고 이런 노래 하는 거 처음봐서 그런지 스펙트럼도 넓고 이제 진면모를 조금씩 알게 된 느낌 정말 멋진 무대였음
=
케이 럽리에서 내던 목소리랑 달라서 좋음
=
Sorry I'm still new to K-pop so I don't know this group. Who are they?? They sang so beautifully ❤️
=
Hwasa has Soo much control on her voice 😘
=
I wish there is no reactions. It's distracting. But I guess that's how the show works. Lol. Btw. Hwasa got it
=
케이 이번에 완전 달라보인다 목소리도 그렇고 둘이 합도 잘맞고
=
so awesome!! love the song and their voices!
=
Thanks Im gay now
=
I died at 2:46. This girl is also slayiiiing. I wanna know her nameeeeee. 😍❤️
=
Hwasa 😭😍
=
헐 케이 목소리 개좋다. 화사는 말할것도 없고.
=
화사언니야 당연히 신급 넘사벽인데 아 케이님 발라드 솔로 내주세요 제발요 엉엉 아니 목소리 너무 보석같아 이 목소리를 왜 섞혀요 아 발라드 내줘요!!!!!!
=
Голос Hwasa просто секс 🔥
=
와...진짜 가수란 물론 보이는 외모도 팬들을사로잡는데 있지만 무엇보다 음악의분위기에맞게부르는것과 음색을 더 중요시봐야한다는걸 깨달았다
=
can they upload separate videos without reactions of the other idols
=
와 화사 진짜 대박이다 화사는 어딜가서든 사랑받을 사람일듯  특별한 화사만의 매력이 다른 사람들한테는 갖고싶어도 못 갖는 보석임
=
hawsaaaaa 😭 😭 ♥️♥️♥️♥️
=
DO u know how many times I loop this MV? hehehe a lot!! I LOVE IT
=
화사 음색좋은거는 알고있었는데 이노래는 케이님 이렇게 잘하시는줄 몰랐어ㅠㅠ이런 노래 너무 잘어울려요ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Do they have this uploaded somewhere without the Queendom reactions? I loved seeing their reactions but it kinda breaks up the feels of the song and I want to hear it on it's own as a performance.
=
화사가 왜 차트 사기캐인지 알겠네 
오래 가수할 듯
=
화사는 팝송커버하면 대박나겠다
=
All I’m getting from Hwasa and Kei is real life Bubbline
=
AAAA💖
=
AAAA💖
=
화사는 진짜 할많하않이고 케이는 저음이 훨씬 매력적이네
=
This is making me also wonder how do you make yourself sound that way. Like HOW. I dont know how to describe it but Hwasa's singing really does sound different and 

I kinda wanted to ask why she isnt wearing make up? Because i'm digging it she looks sooo beautiful 💕
=
Other idols: plastic surgery duck lips 😂
=
hwasa: 


me: 3:14
=
Even Solar was amazed by her dongseang
=
빌리아일리시 노래중에서도, 팝송중에서도 제일 좋아하는 노래를 화사랑 케이가 커버해주다니😭 진짜 두분 음색이 완전 잘어울린다
귀호강이라는 말을 여기에 쓰는거구나,,
=
The lyrics are so deep! Kei and Hwasa did an awesome collab!
=
제발.. 화사님 유튭 채널하나 만들어서 이노래 불러주세요....
=
I´m still wondering why mnet edit things that way...
=
화사 너무좋다
=
I love how Kei manages to "look cool" here instead of "look cute" as she usually does. She can pull it well actually.
=
아 지민 리액션 왜이리 섹시하짘ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
예쁘다😍😍😍
=
Selfish에서 와....
=
*HWASA ITs a IncReDible Queen!*


Te amo Hwasa ♡
=
케이 여기서 식센 만회한거같아서 다행이다ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I didn't expect Kei can also pull off this kind of song.
=
Hwasa OMGGGGG
=
KEI IS SO FABULOUS OMG~!!!!
=
Ok but Kei in this was amazing
=
바로 음원 떠라 제발 난리난다 진짜 오바야 화사언니 사랑해요 진짜 난리나 와 아니 목소리가 너무 잘어울리고 와
=
Can we get this video without reactions?
=
화사랑 정말 잘어울리는곡이네요 빌리의 띵곡 중하나죠 ㅠㅠ
=
둘다 오지네👍🏻
=
both kei and hwasa are so good omg i love uuuuu twoooo
=
Hwasa singing it the perfect feels like, "im bored" feels, she sang it effortlessly, the other girl namely Kei has a good voice tho, its just that Hwasa nailed this one.

PS: I edited it already so calm down now, I can see how fans love and show support to Kei, thats good and fighting!
=
💗💗💗💗💗
=
잘부르는데 뭔가 어색해보이는건 오ㅔ그럴까ㅠㅠ
=
This is in Korea?!
Omg 
They are ..... less conservative now 😱 😊soooo happy
=
Kei ❤❤❤❤❤❤
=
케이는 얼마나 이런 노래가 하고 싶었을까ㅜㅜ
퀸덤 계기로 하고싶은거 다 했음 좋겠다....

화사 사랑해
=
I too wish Hwasa were gay 😔✊🏳️‍🌈✨
=
just finished queendom and i definitely like all of them now. Seeing this side of Hyejin is great. She’s a badass but a softie in the inside. Love this performance - not a fan of billie but now i’m considering listening to her songs
=
This is beautifully
=
Omg😍😍
=
밑에 댓글에 공감하는게 
화사 음색 자체가 끈적해서 민니랑 했으면 오히려 곡 성격탓에도 루즈해질 수도 있었음
근데 케이가 재발견인게 중간평가까지만 해도 그 걸그룹 노래만의 가볍게 부르는? 그런게 여전히 있었는데
이번에 목소리도 훨씬 맑은데 무거워짐 
딱 화사가 분위기 끌고가고 케이가 균형 맞추는 느낌
=
Melting 😍. What a powerful duo.
Kei is so amazing. Love all the way🤩😍
=
나만 알았으면 했던 띵곡인뎅....
이왕 널리 퍼저랏
=
진짜 화사 미쳤어 ㅡㅡ왜저래진짜♥️ 
좀 너한테 그만 빠지고 싶어 ..!!!!
(어우.. 박봄 얼굴 보고 개놀람;;..)
=
I'm all gay for  Hwasa 😍
=
[ pansexual distress ]
=
케이란 가수에 대해 다시 보이네요 ㅎ 물론 화사도 넘 좋았고 몰랐던 매력
=
keipop queen 😍😍
=
hwasa's so accustomed to control and fire up the stage and knows that she'll get so many support but kei :") god i am really really happy to see her doing that she's enjoying what she's doing bro <33
=
화사 작은 추임새 으흐헤이 이런것도 묘하게 발린다 느린데 거침없고 저 카메라 슬쩍 함 바쥬까? 하는 눈빛도 너무 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 평생 노래해줬으면
=
진짜 이 분이 퀸덤 비둘기 맞나요? 세상에 어느 비둘기가 이렇게 치명적이냐고 어떻게 날 안 좋아할 수가 있어? 너 게이 아냐? 라고 말하는게 막 느껴져 분명 영어인데 100% 알아먹겠는건 왜일까요..... 분위기도 미쳤고 음색도 미쳤고 눈빛도 미쳤고 그냥 다 미쳤어ㅠㅠ
=
3:40 that girl is all of us tbh
=
they’re both chaotic gays especially hyejin around kei lmao
=
아 존나 소름돋아;;
=
도입부부터 화사가 장악했네.... 케이도 잘 이어갔고 화사 음색은 진짜 몸이 진득하게 흘러내리는 것 같어...
=
omg did you see park bom's face i-
=
Kei is amazing😍😍
=
Omg hwasa!!! Why are you doing this to us!😭
=
Kei did amazing!!! 🤩😍 they both did amazing 💜💜😱
=
화사는 진짜 자기노래 하듯이 하네
=
That hwasa she so cool 😎😍👏👏
=
3:24 wtf is that
=
와.... 화사 분위기 무엇
조용조용 읊조리는데 내가 다 미안할 정도로 절절하다ㅠㅠ
=
OMG Hwasaaaa
=
와 이건 진짜 그냥 감탄밖에 안나온다
진짜 너무 잘해 둘이 목소리 안어울릴거라고 생각했는데 너무 잘어울린다....... 중간에 눈가리고 웃고 하는거에 내 심장 이미 발려서 잼이 되었어요 구오..............
=
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3 Billie Eilish ,<3i love this songggg!!!!
=
화사 화장 찐하게안했는데 ㄹㅇ 쎄
=
Omg, the girl with orange suit KILLED IT
=
Those lyrics are just the thing i would say to Moonbyul lol...
=
화사 진짜 개쩐다 미쳤다 케이도 생각보다 성숙한 음색이네 ㄷㄷ잘한다 둘다 ,,
=
omg kei voice is so beautifyl ! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=
Hawsa voice omt
=
HWASA & KEI : CONFIRM GAY ✅
=
HWASA & KEI : CONFIRM GAY ✅
=
Me: "I just kinda wish I was Kei~"
=
Is Hwasa American or summin? Her english is pretty good:0
=
3:58 저 때 화사 마이크 뽑는 거 놓쳐서 잠깐 당황했던 것 같은데 저런 모션까지도 멋져ㅋㄱㄱㅋㄱㅋㄱ
=
Her wish is my command ( so I'm gay now)
=
DEADASS BEGAN TO TEAR UP HEARING THE BOTH OF EM 👏👏👏
=
I mean she is just Queen.
Hwasa is pure talent
=
Hwasa 😍😍😍😍
=
I want Hwasa and Minnie collaboration :D
=
Hwasa 😄😄😄😄, who else gets goose bumps everytime my girls sings
=
No one can top korean reactions
=
화사는 어쩜 노래를 저렇게 쫀득하게 부를까 최고다 진짜
=
Kei has a beautiful voice.
=
Whoever the first one is was amazing with her English
=
Hwasa no makeup wow so beautiful
=
Kei’s Expressions ofjdjchdhxhc
=
케이 이렇게 잘하는애였어? ㅋㅋ화사도 음색 미쳤다
=
what a beautiful cover
=
I keep coming back to this video because Hwasa's voice is so breathless insanely good here. 
She's know how to play with that rasp and breathe technic. Just a goddess singer.
=
the blonde girl was so good omg
=
me dió un paro conchal ahre xdxdxd
=
케이도 평소 색깔 벗어나서 잘했는데 선곡이 너무 화사꺼다... 걍 첫소절에 정리됨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
dude the vocals im crying
=
I'm glad im gay
=
She sounds exactly like Billy
=
If you've followed queendom until this point, and know how much kei wanted to pair with hwasa for this duet, this performance has a whole another meaning :')
=
Whose gay after watching this?

Me: I am!
=
케이 대박이다...화사는 그냥 자기 노래같음...와아....
=
wow it's so good
=
Tag yourself : I’m park bom at 3:23
=
The girl at 3:40 A MOOD
=
화사한마디할 때마다 감탄사나오네ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
hwasaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!! u nailed it. Btw I lovebillie 😘
=
1:03 who is that girl
=
i really like hwasa voice..
=
IDOLAS 💕💕
Best colaboración or best colaboración ♡
=
That's my Queen😎😎
=
Hwasaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!
=
I just kinda wish you were Kei~~ sry bad joke but I couldn't help myself haha
=
Kei was super good! ( Hwasa too)
=
둘이 진짜 잘 어울린다ㅠㅠㅠㅠ목소리랑 캐릭터 다 쩌는 조합 완전 되는 주식임 퀸덤 끝나고 둘이서 예능 하나 찍었으면 좋겠다
=
케이씨는라커스탈이시넵
=
Kei released a new album and I'm so excited to listen to it
=
Wheein has to be freaking shook. 😂😂 #Wheesa
=
Wish granted. I’m gay.
=
화사는 진짜 색이 있다.. 설명 못할 색 뭐라해야하지, 꼴꽉한 색깔???ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 꽉꼴꽉골한 느낌이 있음 암튼
=
Billie who
=
카메라 자제좀...ㅋㅋ
=
@ 3:40
same here girl, same here
=
Kei you did amazing
=
케이 처음엔 음색 되게 높다고 생각했는데 첫소절 듣자마자 홀려들었다ㅠㅠ 되게 적당히 높은 음에다 파워풀한 중저음 섞은 느낌 ㅠㅠ 화사랑 진짜 잘 어울린다
=
QUE VOZES LINDAS😍😍
=
essential sings a homophobic song in korea, koreans never be so proud
=
I dead thought that was byul like I thought hwabyul is all good now..imaclown
=
Hwasa: ''i kinda wish you were gay''
me:i am since today! hahaaa!
=
Give hwasa any song and she’ll nail it
=
Wheein in the back:Babe i am
=
I'm gay now.
=
화사 혼자 부르는거 보고싶다ㅠㅜㅜ
=
Wooowwww... just woooww, they were so awesome
=
Hwasa: i wish you were gay
Me: your wish is my command mistress 💁
=
Kei look like Đặng Tử Kỳ❤️❤️
=
Keren banget astagaaa, queen!!!
=
Hwasa sexy voice captured me..😍😍😍
=
KEI IS AMAZING OMG
=
Bom didn’t blink for one second is she breathing

Edit: I didn't expect the comment to receive so much attention and likes. I think that people who liked this comment must've understood what I meant by it which is basically that Bom liked the performance so much that she was so into it. It's not about how Bom looks like or how many plastic surgeries she has gone through. That doesn't concern me neither people who are hating on that. That's all!
=
Omo whasa i love you sing this song.couse i love so much billi..
Yup i wish you a gay👍😘
=
STAN LOVELYZ
=
Someone tell me the name of the girl with the blond hair and grey top that doesn't look Korean pleeeeease 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
=
Who are they and why do I have goosebumps just by looking at them and hearing them sing?!?!
=
lol it's cute that everyone is such a fangirl to hwasaaaa
=
Help I cried
=
케이도 잘하는데 화사가 너무 넘사벽이라 약간 번갈아부를때마다 느낌이 확다름
=
I know Hwasa is from Mamamoo but can someone tell me where the other girl is from? Her vocals were good too
=
other idols be like:YES WE GAY NOW
=
아니 진짜 화사는 못하는게 뭐야 제스쳐 라이브 순발력 뒤집어지네
=
I like kei's low registers. Hwasa's good with high notes, and i really like her stage presence, the way she moves, the way she walks, her expressions, everything. My god! This makes me kinda gay. Lol
=
Came here to watch hwasa but holy shit kei has such a beautiful voice
=
This duo got #1 because of Hwasa… seriously anyone that teamed up with Hwasa would come up to be #1
=
Did Billie Ellish saw this video ?? And if it's yes did she reacted ??
=
화사랑 케이 둘 목소리 너무 잘 어울리고, 동작 하나하나 간지 터지고 확실히 화사 무대 장악력이 남다른듯,, 
(+) 이번 경연은 음원 왜 안나오는지 아시는분,, 음원 존버했는데 안나와서 영상만 지금 몇 번 보는건지ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Legends supporting legends
=
ok. i'm gay now. haha.
=
ถ้ามินนี่มาร้องคู่กับ hwasa น่าจะเพราะและปังกว่านี้คูณไปอีก keiก็งั้นๆผมว่า
=
SHE SANG "gay" WITH A LOT OF CLASS QHQHHSQNNZMQLDLCLFKFMNDKD I'M WHEEZING.
=
HWASA IM ALREADY GAY FOR U BUT AFTER THIS PERFORMANCE, Im gay for both 👁👄👁
=
yup. I’m gay 😐😂
=
I looked confused at the song title for a really long time... 
*But it really didn’t surprise me since we’re talking about Hwasa here!*
=
My lesbian heart is jumping listening this haha
=
Now I expect holland to be on mnet soon
=
화사 진짜 끼가 많다 못해 넘처 흘러 줄줄 센다 막 미쳤어 ..
=
STAN THIS WOMEN
=
Hwasa: breathes
Every other girl idol:😍😍😍  wahhh she so cool💀💀💀
=
First, i thought the girl next to Hwasa was Moonbyul, but after a few seconds a realized she wasn't. Now I'm dying bc i fell in love with that girl too and i just wanna know where she comes from AAAH
=
hwasa:
eu: au au
=
화사는 갬성 충만이고 케이는 개인적으로  맑은 목소리에서 가사 한 마디를 꽉찬 느낌으로 부르니깐 듣기 좋았던거 같닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ파압~으로 충격먹었는데 이번엔 정말 둘이 다른 느낌으로 좋다
=
3:24 is everybody's face after realizing that billie eilish wrote this song for a guy and not a girl. Lol it's when ur crush doesnt like u and ure just wishing him to be gay to lessen the pain of being rejected.




But i dont wanna ruin ur little gay hearts, just found bom's face to be too cute! it seems that she doesnt even know what's going on. Lol
=
I think hwasa and kei are my fav kpop star
=
They did really well. I enjoyed this performance. Kei is pretty and her I like the tone of her voice. And oh my god Hwasa! She slayed me with performance. So so cool!!! Her pronunciation and technique were so good too. She was born for the stage indeed.
=
How were they serious throughout this
=
퀸화사 ,, 음색 진짜 팝송 부르면 찰떡인 음색이 아닐수가 없음 현 여돌중에서 가장 팝송에 걸맞는 음색이 아닐지
=
hwasa voice; sounds angelic.
=
hwasa my love💖💖💖💖
=
Kei in blonde is omgggg
=
I saw gidle istg I'm crying
=
I am so sorry.... But i didn't know kei's voice was THIS lit !!! Like I'm already gay for Hwasa but Kei  !!! 😍😍
=
Hwasa 👑😍😎💜❤️🔥
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
=
화사에 민니였다면 어땠을까
=
민니랑 했으면 어땠을까,,
=
gimbap couple ❤️
=
화사 진짜 사람 자체가 너무 멋있다 몸짓 하나하나가 너무 자연스럽고 진짜 고급스러움ㅠㅠ
=
Kei and Hwasa’s pronunciation are really really good. And Kei definitely sounded different during practice and live hahahaha can’t stop falling for these two <3 #KimbapCouple
=
1:03 👁👄👁
=
KEI KILLED IT
=
_I think i'm rlly gay now..._
=
i love keis voice!! what group is she from or is she a solo artist??
=
Billie should see this
=
개인적으로 박봄 화사 같이 하는거 보고싶었는데 그럼 너무 사기려나...
=
Fits Hwasa's voice like she owns the song 💕
=
케이 목소리 속삭이는 그런 노래에 진짜 잘어울리는듯
화사는 음색뿐 아니라 호흡도 너무 매력적임 ㅠ
=
Park Bom is me watching this
=
2:44 , 1:24  ,4:26 ㅇ.. ㄱㅔ이었으면 바래?
=
1:01 PLEASE I NEED TO KNOW THE NAME OF THIS ANGEL
=
I truely fall for Kei's voice in this performance.
=
Hwasa is the reason I'm gay
=
Them doing this in a very conservative country... We Stan!
=
3:11
=
Park bom at the back stage yey!
=
이거 완전 그거잖아... 케이 화사 A(남자)로 이루어진 무리에서 A에게 차인 후 괴로워하는 케이와 그런 케이를 바라보며 괴로워하는 화사
여기서 화사>케이>A 이렇게 좋아한다는 설정임 wish you were gay 의 의미가 서로 다른 거지
케이는 차라리 A가 게이라서 자신을 찼다고 믿고 싶은 거고 화사는 자신이 사랑하는 케이가 게이였음 하는 거고
=
화사는 노래 잘한다는 걸 알고 들으면서도 항상 목소리에 치여... ㅋㅋㅋ 나오건 들어가건 팔짱을 잊지않는 케이 넘 귀여워 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 둘이 목소리 잘 어울리고 케이도 노래 잘 하더라~~
=
still here
=
Kei is fantastic..such a rare talented beautiful girl
=
Both are suns of a solar system
=
Kei makes it sound too korean
=
화사는 걍 간지의 피가 흐른다... 그냥 앉기만 해도 걷기만 해도 다른사람이랑 달라...
=
Amo sus falsetes 💕
=
😍 😍 😍 😍 😍
=
케이파합
=
Hwase & Keiand Billie should do a collab, I bet it would be cool
=
화사는 음색이 진짜 탈 한국인이네;;
=
I'M GAY FOR HWASA
=
I dont really enjoy watching reaction. Idols are trained to give reaction so sometimes I feel like they re just overreact a little bit. But I love how Mamamoo girls always stay calm when they watch others' performance and only Solar with full of memeable face .😂
ANYWAY,  kei and hwasa shoulddddd have a duet album with this kinda genre pleeeeease. I really enjoy this harmonization
=
The word gay never sounded this good before. (The ending part.)
=
0:07 3:33
=
화사 고냥 찰떡이다... 음색 너무좋고...
화사혼자 부른것도 들어보고싶어
=
You could see a lot of sexual awakenings in this video.
=
Hwasa's every gesture + other teams watching over them = gay


First time I watched this, but it's been on my recommendation for ages xD I kinda I hate the fact that I just clicked to it now. 
Kei did well too :) I don't know her but she did it nicely.
=
They took the whole vibe outta the song I didn't like it😫
=
둘이 별로 안어울린다고 생각했었는데.. 내가 틀렸네
=
화사 무대는 어떻게 이렇게 잘하지? 하면서 보게 되는데 볼때마다 더 잘해짐. 퍼포 무대 장악력부터 보컬 을 예술로 소화하네 진짜 타고났다 와... 화사를 세계 무대로~ 지금도 대단하지만 몇년 후에 어마어마해질듯.
=
Okay, I think all girls can agree that we're gay for both of them.
=
Hwasa our queen
=
still so good
=
둘이 너무 부르는 방식이 달라서 뭔가가 쪼금 안맞는 느낌이 있는 것 같네요:)
=
화사야...  하...
진짜 미친거아니냐... 소름돋아미치것다
케이 너도 이쁜얼굴에 목소리를 제대로 못들었었던거같아 노래도진짜잘하는구나
=
I am not so love Kei 😅
=
♥️♥️♥️
=
please can someone tell me who kei is i'm in love i think
=
Kei you slay it love you
=
화사가 이 곡의 감정선을 제대로 탔네
=
my face is just like how bommie unnie's face is: SHOOKTH
=
yes hwasa i'm gay can you kiss me?
=
Hwasa😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
=
♡
=
i got so excited and then remembered that the lyrics are straight
=
Hwasa😘
=
녹는당 ......
=
Omg so cool cover for billie eillish
=
‼Hwasa is nominated for best female artist at mnet mama please make sure to support her and vote for her ‼
=
kei is such a versatile singer. She can delivered in every genre. I'm so shook listening to her voice tone.  It has kei signature but it sound so sexy.  Congratulation kei for always give us a good performance!!
=
why is it so annoying with the reaction? i just wanna hear them clearly singing damn
=
I love how they don't understand anything, or maybe they do and their just all gay.
=
C'était un spectacle extraordinaire.
=
Daebak ! Yeeeeeah !!
=
화사 부를 때마다 온 몸에 전율이 찌릿찌릿 ㅠ
=
케이 오져
=
헐
=
둘이 동갑이라는게 믿기지가 않는다
=
🥰🥰🥰🥰
=
케이목소리 진짜진짜 예쁘다 이런 목소린지 오늘 처음 알았어... 소속사는 당장 케이 목소리 평생 보존시킬것...
=
Billie is pleased..
=
Billie!!!!
=
OMFG HYEJIN
=
ODIO ESTO CON TODA MI ALMA NO PUEDE PASAR ESTO DESDE AHORA SEPULTÓ TODO MAMAMOO
=
노래 잘부르는 대선배가 생각보다 노래 잘하는 후배 데리고 듀엣 해주는 프로그램 보는 것 같음
=
A guy in 2:06 : 💞💕💞✨✨



HE'S SO CUTE Y'ALL!!!!
=
Half the views are mine cus damn
=
"I wish you were gay"
Koreans: "You wish I was dog?"
=
yes,i am
=
러블리즈에 케이와 예인이라는 아이가 있다는걸 이프로를 통해 첨 앎. 둘의 매력에 폭 빠짐~마마무팬이지만 러블리즈도 매력적이네요~~
=
ชอบคนผมขาวมากกว่านิดนึง
=
*HWASA IS A QUEEN!*
=
노래만듣고싶다 !!
=
Kei killed this
=
케이 저음 너무 좋아하는데 소속사가 자꾸 고음만 엄청 부르게 해•••저음이 진짜 말도 안되게 매력적인데•••
=
As a gay I approve
=
*LISTEN TO MAMAMOO'S NEW SONG CALLED DESTINY*
=
i can't believe she's the same girl who did the cutest oppaya... 😍😍
=
보컬 유닛 순위 어땋게 되요??
=
Hwasaa, that enunciation tho *chefskiss, she breathes gold
=
Surprised about Keiiii
=
Hwasa's such a natural performer and her voice fits so well but Kei really surprised me her voice fits so well!
=
I don’t really think there that good
=
Hwasa is the best 🥰
=
케이 목소리 되게 성숙하게 내고 화사는 진짜 뭔가 그 느낌이 있음 둘 다 조합 진짜... 최고다
=
*WHO IS HERE BECAUSE OF MICHAENG?*
=
OMG OMG OMG
=
Baby, I don't feel so good
Six words you never understood
I'll never let you go
Five words you'll never say (aw)
I laugh alone like nothing's wrong
Four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us
One slipped away

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, mm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 'Heys' (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearing out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away (yay)

How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
=
그리고 편집 중간중간 노래 흐름 끊는거 거슬리네요
=
화사 개쩐다...다들 왜 화사랑 하고싶었는지 알겠네;; 케이도 잘하네 내가 알던 케이  음색이 아니임;;
=
화사 어떻게 이걸 이렇게 부르지 진짜 쩐다
=
화사 커버곡 냈으면 좋겠다...
=
초반엔 화사캐리 조합인가 했는데 갈수록 존재감 뿜으시네 중반에 케이부분에서 소름 돋았자너 ㅠㅠ
=
I'm fall in love with hwasa 's voice
=
Hwasa's voice is ❤
=
SHE RAISED HER EYEBROW AND I FELL IN LOVE
I AM GAY FOR THIS
=
I wanna hear minnie to do a cover of this song!!!
=
I hope they release an studio version of this. I want this on my playlist ❤️
=
Woaah Kei's voice is so beautiful 😍
=
I don't know this grup BUT I AM REALY REALY LOVE THIS SONG AND THEY VOICE IS SO PRETTY ❤
=
Queen Hwasa is so damn cool..  ❤️
=
Both of them were so good! Hwasa has a really captivating aura!
=
3:47 케이 잘 못즐기는거 같다
=
3:03 OMG KEIIIII💕💕💕
=
Can’t help it that Hwasa’s voice has some depth and technique on this. She can make her voice as breathy as Billie’s!!
=
케이도 진짜 잘했다 분위기좋은 펍같은데에서 노래부르는 느낌남
=
Mamamoo & Lovelyz  ..d>_<b..
=
언니들이라면 1시간 거리도 5분 만에 달려갈 수 있어
=
이거 음원 안나오나요 ㅠㅠ
=
I'm ready.
=
Kei is so hot 😍
=
This is so good. It's better than I expected. I  just want to listen to it again and again.
=
So the blonde girl name is Kei? U did it well honey
=
their voices went so well together I'm still not over this 💖💖💖
=
이번주 케이랑 화사 둘다 컴백하니깐 제발 어느 음악방송이라도 좋으니깐 컴백스테이지에서 잠시나올때 같이 나왔으면
=
케이가 보컬학원에서 잘배운 깔끔한 보컬느낌이면
화사는 누구의 터치도 거부하는 독자적 스트릿 느낌
=
케이도 진짜 짱인데 화사는...혜진이는....라이언은.... 
저 옷을 선택한 혜진이 칭찬해ㅠㅜㅜㅜ 코디님도 칭찬해여...ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 어떻게 저렇게 노출 배 쪼금 밖에 없는데 왜케 섹시하지...ㅜㅠㅠㅜ 안혜진 다해라ㅜㅠㅜㅜ 
저 음색가지고 외국가서 더 흥해라 이 잘난넘아!!!
=
화사 진짜 이 노래 한번 각잡고 커버해줬으면 좋겠다...
=
와.. 미친거아냐 화사 목소리가 어떻게 저러지? 근데 케이라는 분도 노래 참 잘하네 둘 케미 완젼 좋아~
=
구냥 노래만 보여주세요ㅠ 제발ㄹ
=
Ghaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddd
=
is this really happening? in homophobic korea?
=
Why is everyone talking about how Kei isn't getting talked about instead of actually talking about her..
=
I know they chose the partner themselves, but the pairing between them was unexpected. Both Kei and Hwasa really complemented each other despite different personalities and looks. I gotta give Kei kudos too because I've always seen Hwasa with this type of vibe, which she always kills it 100%, but Kei also slayed this kind of vibe. Much love to both of them.
=
So we gone talk about Kei?? She did so well!!
=
pls tell me they got the top spot OMG goosebumps
=
nah i just kinda wish you were kei.
=
Pota ang galing ni hwasa
=
Hwasa: How am I supposed to make u feel okay?





Me: u can’t bc u exist I’m not okay every time I see u cause I die 😂
=
I just kinda wish u were kei
=
IS THAT BOM!??!?!?@?!?!?
=
I hate how the reactions ruins the performance
=
OMG KEIIIIIIIII
=
hwasa singing this with no makeup and *that* outfit along with kei is the gayest thing ever and you can't tell me otherwise. hwasa and kei said lebian rights eYe-
=
I don’t like Mamamoo, but I can say that Hwasa and Kei slayed this
=
I am gay for Hwasa, and Hwasa only
=
Woah hwasaaaaaaaa
=
화사는 미국 활동하자 ㅡㅡ
=
화사도 화사지만 난 여기서 케이가 너무 멋있어ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
평소 케이 노래부르는 목소리랑 분위기가 넘 달라가지구 진짜 최구다
=
선곡 자체가 너무 화사 쪽 창법이나 스타일쪽으로 치우쳐져잇다..
=
Kei you rocked girl💖💖💖
=
Hwasa >>>>>>


Before somebody attack me, it's my opinion
=
Hwasa is a great performer. She knows what moves to make and expression at the right time. Raw talent.
=
이무대는 난 개인적으로 케이 금발한거 이무대에 넘 잘어울리는것 같고 화사는 노래에 잘 맞는다 해야하나...음색이나 창법 등등 너무 잘어울림...
=
i know am gay
=
Ok 
I'm gay.
=
😍😍😍
=
Hwasa is queen
=
화사 진짜 프로다...카메라 바로 찾고 표정연기하는 것 봐...
=
Ok but Kei😭😭😭
=
I aspire to be as swag as Hwasa
=
Welp we're now gay for hwasa
=
Keiiiiii 😍
=
woww
=
Does the audience only cheer for hwasa?
=
Her face at 0:52 😶
=
😍😍😍
=
화사는 ㄹㅇ 프로 그자체다 사기캐임 음색이랑 여유까지
=
진짜 신기하다.. 화사부분 듣자마자 음색과 발음의 중요성때매 야 이건 케이가 좀 묻히겠다 싶었는데 또 케이 듣자마자 야 가창력이랑 순 보컬능력이 짱이야 음색발음 필요없어 됨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 그리고 이거 계속 반복.. 둘다 너무 잘해.. 그리고 사실 둘 다 워낙 잘해서... 특출난 부분이 눈에 띄는거지ㅜㅜ 결론은 다 중요하다.. 그리고 다 잘한다... 아 둘이 같이 부르는 부분 너무좋아ㅜㅜ 몰라 맨날 봐야지 이영상.. 둘이 마지막에 껴안는것도 너무좋아ㅜㅜㅜ
=
Minnie and hwasa’s duet if this is the big i wish. 😭
=
Everybody there gay panicking even though some isn't noticeable
=
I JUST KINDA WISH THEY WERE GAY
=
진짜 화사좌 나혼산이랑 너무 다른거 아닙니까?? 나혼산 보다가 이무대 보면  아 맞다 본업이 아이돌이였지 참;;; 하게됨
=
Talented
=
Your wish is my command
=
케이원래노래잘부르는데식스센스는안어울리는거해서그런거에요..
=
Everyone in the audience jamming to the song not knowing what gay is
=
Somewhere Loco is dying watching this on repeat 😂
=
Heoksi Uri Hwasa...😘
=
Park bom issa whole mood !!!
=
둘다 너무 잘했지만 개인적으로 케이 음색이 튀어서 그런지 케이 목소리가 귀에 맴도는 느낌..??
=
Voise Hwasa so relax
=
와 케이 마지막에 가사 gay 숨토해내며 마무리한거 소름 ㄷㄷ
=
I JUST KINDA WISH YOU WERE GAY
=
화사랑 휘인이랑 한거 보고싶다
뭔가 케이보단 휘인이랑 하면 너무 잘 어울릴거 같아
=
Im fully gay now-
=
i just kinda wish you were kei'
=
is no one gonna talk about kei??
hwasa is queen but look at babygirl harmonizing with her <33
=
Alus pisan hwasa (_|^∆^)_|
=
Hwasa is the Wonho for female idols
=
It's me or EVERYONE are being gay for Hwasa ?😏
=
omg...ruining the song...
=
화사 화장연하게 하니깐~표정이 백배는 더 매력적이다~앞으로도 무대에서 이런 화장보고싶다~♡♡  화사넘좋아
=
Abutbutbut I am gay for hwasa
=
95년생이라 구오인가 이름??
=
Still can’t get over this
=
还行吧
=
Homo meaning gay or happy(since gay also means happy)
=
Já falei que amo a hwasa??????
=
케이 저음이 생각보다 너무 좋다
=
Kei's close-ups are unfair: she's too pretty! She has an exceptional voice too!
=
Why isn't no one talking about Kei?
=
Kei's voice is really mature and beautiful
=
러블리즈 소속사가 러블리즈는 고음,청순,발랄만 시키니까
몇몇 멤버 음역대에 안맞는데 자기 강점 다버리고 그냥 활동만시킨듯
퍼포먼스,보컬 이번에 딱보니까 알 것같음,,ㅋ

추가적으로 왜 태그에 러블리즈가 없는지 궁금하네요
=
화사는 무대를 지배할줄 안다... 킹갓
=
화사는 지인짜 무대천재다
=
I never knew who Hwasa was but I can now confirm I love her...
Also can we give Kei some love? What a cutie
=
nobody is talking about Kei, I love Hwasa, but please let's give love to all
=
2:05  am i the only one who thinks his reaction was adorable i literally stan
=
I loved the way that they sang, but.....I loved the reaction more 😂😂😂
=
3:25 the cutest beann 😭💕💕💕
=
two of the my favorite things ever, mamamoo and billie eilish😍😍😍
=
I was shook when they said gay 😂, I forgot the song
=
Omg Hwasa makes me crazyyyy
=
does anyone know all of the girl groups featured in this? 🥺
=
Solar looked so proud 🥺
=
THEIR VOICES COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER SO WELL
=
I’m really loving this!😍🥰
=
Want to listen 화사 sing full song😍
=
케이 진짜 너무 멋있어
=

=
으르렁이랑 너무 다른거 나만 웃기냐??ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
진짜 화사언니 목소리 실화냐고...ㅠ
어떻게 이렇게 찰떡이지?!
=
OMG I LOVE IT SO MUCH ! 😭😍😲🤯💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
=
MARAVILHOSASSSS... Apenas😍😍😍😍
=
HWASA ❤❤❤❤❤
=
this is so lit... they both are really good. esp hwasa.
i wish she can perform this song with minnie too.
=
케이야 ... 내가 파압이라고 놀려서 미안해 ... 너무 잘부른다
=
I already am gay... 😂 (Hwasa lookin real good)
=
I'm sorry but KEI WAS FREAKING AMAZING!!!! As much as I love hwasa, I gotta say kei's voice is so versatile compared to her usual singing. Her pronunciation was so sexy and on point and her riffs are just awesome!! Loving hwasa's husky tone and absolutely lovin both of their vocal colours!!
=
Oh my god,love!
=
so perfect
=
How 'bout kei?💕
=
나는 화사도 좋지만 케이 목소리가 계속 맴돌고 음색과 노래가 너무 잘 맞는 것 같다고 생각함 ㅜ
=
yeah wish you were gay Hwasa cuz I'm completely gay for you 😔😍
=
IM DEATH OMFG
=
Better than the "Bad Guy" :D
=
I'm gay hwasa 😍
=
I just got shivers down my spine.
=
I wish i was gay bec of hwasa! Love u from a fan here in philippines!😘
=
can we talk about how Kei slayed the stage with Hwasa
=
다들 화사얘기만 하네... 제가 보기엔 케이도 너무 잘했어요!ㅎ 음색이 너무 어른스러워서 진짜 좋았음ㅋ 얼굴은 애긴데ㅡㅎ
=
Well, girl, I am. Come and get me - I'm all yours
=
WE ALL ALREADY GAY FOR YOU DW ABOUT THAT SLFNSKGNDKGK
=
QUEEN PLS STEP ON MY FACE
=
왜 유닛 무대 한 노래는 음원에 안내보내 주시는 거죠..??? 제발 음원 내주세여ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ̑̈ 진짜 듣고싶은데ㅠㅠㅠ엉엉
=
1.25배속 음질이 조금 깨지긴 하는데 개오진다ㅠ
=
Hwasa, I'm gay for you
=
Hwasa has me in a big gay oof situation
=
Hwasa es lo +
PD: No sé si soy la única que le estresa que repitan tanto las escenas ;-;
=
Honestly just marry me
=
근데 케이할때만 환호성 안지르는거 기분탓?
=
Billie should see this
=
I'M GAY FOR HWASA AND KEI U DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME- <3<3<3
=
와 케이씨 목소리가 이렇게 좋았군요 처음알았어요
엠넷은 안좋아하는데 퀸덤프로그램은 참 좋네요. 수많은 여자아이돌중에서 이름도모르는 그룹이 태반.. 그나마 이름을 아는 여자아이돌그룹들이 있는데 퀸덤을 통해서 진짜 처음알게된분들도있고 좋네요
=
Honestly, we know that Hwasa can do a wide range of vocals but she chose not to for Kei's vocals to shine!!!! 💗 AAAAA i love her
=
Park bom be like 👁️👄👁️
But tbh we all are
=
음원으로 내줘요 ㅠ
=
Kei😍😍
=
Maaaaaaaaaaa I'm GAYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!
=
Hwasa nem fez isso pra moonbyul kkkk magina
=
Kei literally rocked it
=
Damn now I *really* wish they were gay
=
HWASA slayed it, and we are dead by her gaze
=
아 미쳤다. 화사도 미쳤고 케이도 미쳤다. 솔직히 케이 저런톤 들을일이 별로 없었어서 너무 행복하다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
HhWASAAAA
=
Hwasa slayed the stage as expected but I’m really suprised about Kei! Her voice sounds really powerfull here, wow.
=
okay hwasa calm down my gay ass can't handle this
=
케이는 자기가 원래 노래를 부르던삭로 부를려고 안하고 틀에 벗어 완전 바뀐모습이 너무너무 이뿌다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Hwasa you have to go at hollywood and make a collab with camilla cabello or billie elish. It will be a bomb for us
=
Yassss sis
=
Hwasa literally like she pull off no effort here, it just came so naturally. I felt in love with her voice.
=
화사 제스처 어색하지 않고 노래에 맞게 조절을 너무 잘한다
=
1:30 was that YooA
=
Idk but i cry ;-;
=
화사는 그냥 미쳤고ㅠㅜㅡㅏ헝 
케이는 이번 무대 목소리 진짜 너무 좋아서 미칡ㅎ거 같다 그냥 사랑이다 당신들.
=
Hwasa's low vocal at the end is flawless
=
두 분 음색도 음색인데 selfish 할 때 그 제스쳐 진짜 미치게 하네..
=
이 팀이 제일 조화롭게 찐무대처럼 잘했음
=
I feel like my voice sounds like my cat after i watch this
=
화사 진짜 발음부터 강약까지 개찰떡😭😭😭❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
=
장르 자체가 너무 화사한테 찰떡임... 청순발랄 장르로 갔으면 케이가 더 돋보였을 수도 있겠지만, 이 무대는 솔직히 화사 밖에 안 보임 ㅠ 미쳤음 걍 ㅠ
=
난 갠적으로 케이 음색이 더 좋다ㅠㅠ
=
such an irony hwasa is singing the song i want to sing to her
=
Kei is amazing
=
자신의 목소리를 잘 알고 이해하고 있으니까 이런 곡 고르고 찰떡같이 소화하는 거지 진짜 화사 대박이다..
=
Maybe the haters are right. Hwasa isn't an idol. She is something else entirely.
=
화사 이 분이 어떻게 하면 멋진지?..그멋을아시는거같음..동작하나하나 목소리한소절한소절마다 넘 멋있어..간지나ㅜㅜ
=
ON GOD???
=
hwasa's technique in this kind of song is so so so so special. in kisum's song too
=
came for hwasa and ended up staying for kei lol
=
화사.... 미쳤어. 노래 강약조절하다가 내 입 크기도 조절할거 같아... 진짜 미쳤어 미쳤어.
=
케이랑 화사 화음 부분이 너무 좋다ㅠ
케이목소리가 강력해서 음을 꽉잡고 화사가 작은소리로 서포트해주는게 너무 좋아ㅏㅠㅠㅠ 후ㅜㅜㅜㅜ9
=
I didn't know Kei, damn she's good!
=
화사 동작하나하나가 너무 몰입도있고 목서리도 몰입도있고 넘사벽이다진짜
=
Eu to passada chocada
=
화사가 진짜 팝송이랑 미치게 잘 어울린다..
=
러블리즈는 이 경연으로 포인트를 좀 만회한것 같다.. 어째거나 
곡이 안맞았을 뿐 실력이 검증된 무대...
=
케이 저런얼굴 지을수있으면서 왜ㅠ 식스센스때 윙크를해서ㅠㅜㅠ
=
생각외로 케이 잘어울리고 위화감없어서 놀랐음 케이를 다시보게된 무대임 우리 화사자는 뭐 잘하는거 치명적인거 원래 잘알고있었으니까 두분다 멋졌어용!
=
Me at Hwasa: *"I wish you were gay"*
=
케이 이 곡이랑 목소리 너무 잘 어울림
=
MDS😮❤❤😍😍   


Hwasa+musica favorita=1das melhores coisas do mundo!
=
How come nobody is talking kei? Her voice is absolutely gorgeous!! And that eye brow raise?😍😍😍 Snatched.
=
kei's voice is actually the best thing i've ever head. someone please drop her details🙌
=
1:26
don't mind me it's just for my daily replay
=
And at that day, KOREA was SHOOK, they had felt the CHARISMA of Queen Hwa Sa 👑
=
Omfg God Kei killed me in this (jei was in there 2 just not hwasa) but kei killed me❤❤
=
hwasa's soooooooooooooo hot my God I'm melting i just really really love you, take care always mylove <3
=
IM SO PROUD EVEN KEI DID A GREAT JOB
=
1:27 mdds eu não consigo tirar os olhos da kei
e olha que a hwasa ta no palco junta
perfeitas
=
*I FELT THE GAY AT THE END ISTG* 👏
=
literally their reaction was my reaction
=
(0:27) Solar tho😂 *so cute*
=
Hwasa's voice was made for this genre of music. Reminds me of her Talk cover. Literal chills! Kei, oh my gosh. Being able to hear her really shine through this performance, her voice is powerful and beautiful.
=
the public’s reactions tho how are they so synchronised😭 hwasa impact
=
This really needs to go viral cuz it's a big thing for kpop! Kei and hwasa 화이팅 ♥️
=
R&B definitely suits their voices. I want to listen them singing Soul music cuz that would be something else entirely. Well done Kei and Hwasa!!
=
3:37 everyone went gay im telling you
=
Kei and hwasa's voice are ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
kpop idols with great singing + billie eilish songs = heaven 🥵
=
OMG HWASA, I'M FEELIN GAY FOR HER.
=
Is this a Korean version of The Voice or something like that?
=
even in the middle of talented girl..she  has this incredible presence.... et cette voix ..the voice!!!
=
0:27 she looks so proud omg. hwasa sounds like an angel and kei's voice is so smooth
=
4:15 leader nim be like
=
Woooow hawasa is a peace of art her voice her look everything the best
=
무슨 게이를 저렇게 아련하게 불러 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 걍 화사처럼 부르는게 나은 곡인데 케이 열과 성을 다함 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
And there goes my sanity flying out the window
=
UGHHHHHH hwasaaaaaaa my wig is snatchedT
=
Is no one gonna talk about Park Bom's reactions haha
=
3:39 relatable
=
Hwasa's charisma is no joke, even her breath :) can overwhelm the other :>
=
i feel blessed rn ;jiorfew;ojirqrfe;ijogrw
=
unrelated but like... kei's nose is so cute lmao
=
Love thisss
=
Me encantó ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
越聽越好聽的概念😂
=
Kei sound like wheein to me🥵🥵
=
Just coming back here to say that any other outcome than getting number 1 would have been atrocious, it's a well deserved win
=
yongson laugh at 00:27
=
Hwasa and Kei's voice is so nice
=
the way kei sang “gay~” yo I *felt that*
=
I LOVE TWO WOMANS FK
=
원래도 그랬지만 마마무의 실력을 다시 한번 대중들에게 각인시켜주는 좋은 기회가 된 거 같아 좋고 마마무가 항상 자랑스럽다
=
Hwasa bodyrolled any of my remaining heterosexuality into another dimension and I'm not even mad about that
=
목소리 예술이다진짜...
=
Hwasa and Kei omg heck ye
=
Well now I am..
 thank you ladies
=
둘 다 너무 잘했는데 노래가 너무 화사꺼라 좀 묻히는게 아쉽다ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠ
화사는 화사대로 너무 멋있어 진짜ㅠ

mamamoo said gay rights🏳️‍🌈👏

=
HWASA'S CHARISMA AHHHHHHHHHHHH
=
❤️
=
04:15 놀란 꼬부기
=
WE STAN 🏳️‍🌈👏
=
Hwasa I L O V E Y O U
=
Late but .. can we all appreciate kei's precious voice 😍
=
Korean's : What?????
=
never have i heard someone say “gay” so beautifully-
=
THIS IS A GAYS ONLY EVENT
=
돈 워리 화사. 아임걸앤아임게이. 레디포비잉유어스
=
So when is hwasa gonna release the full cover of this because she is torturing me here
=
I really loved Kei during this performance, her vocals and charisma were everything. Hwasa slayed as well ofc, she is born to be a performer❤️
=
케이 개잘하는데 약간 평가절하되는거같아 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 케이응원함 ♡
=
kei omggggg she is so perfect
=
Im die for Hwasa "Im so selfish"

Im so soft when know Queen Hwasa still use MMM mic :')
=
화사 혼자 빌보드공연중이네
케이 저음 진짜 매력쩌네ㅜㅜ
=
3:14 can someone PLEASE tell me who is she I think I'm in love
=
케이 이런 노래도 잘 어울렸구나...보컬 스펙트럼이 이렇게 넓은지 처음 알았네 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ식스센스 반응 때문에 맘고생 심했을 텐데 이번 무대는 칭찬 받아 마땅하다 케이..노래 정말 잘한다
=
Tangina hwasa sandali lang naman!!!!!!
=
케이 파트 좋다.. 성숙하네 음색이 둘 목소리합 생각보다 너무 좋고.. 안혜진은 말해 뭐해 입만 아파.. 평생 노래해 평생 가수해
=
KEI IS KILLING IT YES MAAM
=
myghad hwasa
=
화사대박이다..와 케이 저런목소리 처음들어 멋있다....
=
Hwasa just has the prefect tone
=
singing wish you were gay, theses queens basically turned all those girl idols gAe
=
화사랑 케이 서로 색이 융화되어서 섞인 느낌이다 엄청 조화로워ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Im now a gay  hwasa🤣😥
=
케이는 무겁고 중심을 잡아주는 낮은 음이 훨씬 더 잘 어울리는 듯..
화사는 평범하지 않은 색다른 목소리로
분위기를 딱 잡아 주니까 심심하지도 않고..
한마디로 둘 다 너무 잘 어울려요 ㅜㅜ
=
People: Kpop idol won’t sing a song like that 
Hwasa : Hold my Food 😂👌
=
Billie elish?
=
PARKBOMMMMM
=
화사 진짜 노래를 잘 이해하고 부른 것 같당 저 노래 주인공같음 무슨
=
AAAAAAAA
=
DUDE the cuts to the reactions are so f*ckin annoying sdkfjsklfjsdkf i wish they'd release a version without them :(
=
Morí aaah es tan grandiosa
=
0:44  1:50  2:53  3:10  4:08
=
화사야 원래 음색 지린건 알고있었는데 케이 진짜 재발견이다..이런 느낌의 곡도 잘 소화할수 있다는걸 보여줬으니까 새로운 컨셉의 러블리즈도 볼수 있었으면...ㅜ
=
YESSSSSASDVWNCBWMCBWKBXJS
=
Alguien sabe dónde lo puedo ver completo?
=
여기서는 Our conversations all in blue고 멜론에서는 Our conversations are in blue인데 뭐가 맞는거임
=
okay hyejin, dont worry, im gay.
=
진짜 화사는 첫 소절부터 압도적이다.
=
every move is a pure gold
=
This is what we call gay queens!
=
hwasa is such a queen like AAQaqAaAa
=
봐도봐도잘하네 ㅋㅋ화사 진짜 찰떡이네 노래에 ㅋㅋ 케이도 잘했음 ㅋㅋ  케이는 좀더 높은?  좀더 분위기가 높은?쪽이 더 잘어울리긴함 be natural -레드벨벳 이노래같은거. 이노래는 화사가 찰떡이라ㅋㅋ 우리나라에서 이노래 이렇게 소화하는 가수는 없을듯 모든 여가수 통틀어서 말하는거 ㅋㅋ
=
no one’s talking about kei, she did amazing :(
=
왜 화사 얘기밖에 없지,,, 케이도 충분히 빛낸 것 같은데,,,
=
Hwasa started singing: Baby, I-
Me: YEEEAAHHH THAT’S MY BIAS PEOPLE
=
케이 모습 색달라서 좋고 음색 넘 좋음 화사도 당연 잘하고
=
케이 파트 되게 소화잘했음 귀에 막 맴돔
=
WHERES THE PEOPLE PRAISING KEI SHES REALLY GOOD THOUGH SHES SO GOOOOOODDDDD LOVE HER
=
승희 표정ㅋㅋㅋㅋ진짜ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ화사랑 케이가 저 리액션 보면 뿌듯할듯
=
i love hwasa but can we just talk about Kei's voice? it's absolutely beautiful
=
HWASA SOUNDED LIKE BILLE ANYWAYS HUHUH I LOVE IT!♡
=
ㅠㅠ 케이잘하는데... 화사가 너무 잘함.....ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 미쳤다
=
화사는 진짜 퀸이다 아 다 매력적이야 진짜 ㅜㅜㅜ 다 예뻐

=
That last part thoooo
=
와 ㄹㅇ 음원 있었으면 ㅜ 화사 ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ개잘어울려ㅠㅠㅠ
=
ya’ll keep talkin bout Hwasa and ngl she was amazing !! but kei tho, SHE DID AMAZING TOO YK LIKE HER VOCALS AND VISUALS IN THIS PERFORMANCE WAS FLAWLESS !! plus her charisma was— yes.
=
I'm so sorry for thinking that was Rosè on the thumbnail <~>
=
Every time I see Park Bom reaction, she represents me.... hahahaha. I like her reaction.
=
Lmfao I thought this was one of those fake sub videos! No way i thought the title really is "i wish you were gay" lolol
=
I guess I’m gay now ❤️
=
WOW AMAZING AMAZING. I have chills when hwasa sang
=
so good omg hwasaa idc how to appreciate it, too coop
=
They did goood a very bery good I love them both ahhh😪❤❤❤❤❤
=
I lost my mind on this one 👸👸👸👸 Hwasa.🥰🥰
=
케이 wish you were gay~~할때 너무 잘하는데 중독 돼서 계속 들으러 와요ㅠ 화가는 말할것도 없구,.
=
Mamamo made me question my sexuality. They all changed me like that👏
=
울 지연이ㅠㅠㅠ잘했어
=
화사 음색 진짜 말 그대로 미..쳤...다.... 참나.... 원곡보다 좋다 ...;;
=
A full version of Hwasa covering this pleaseeee
=
와 화사는 그냥.. 와... 그냥... 할말어뵤다 진짜 너무 대박임
=
As much as I love Hwasa, that other female was taking my breath away😍😍 What's her name?
=
Kei~~~ So beautiful  and has a good voice
HWASAAAA!!!
=
OKAY BUT KEI SNAPPEDDDD
=
1위 축하해요오!!!!
혜진 kei 이 조합 미쳤다니깐....
=
isit only me thinks that Kei a bit looks like & sounds like Solji Exid?
=
I love them..😍
=
미쳐 이거 내 최애곡인데ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅡㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
역시 퀸화사 ...레전드무대ㅜㅜ케이도 음색 굿 둘이 잘어울렸다
=
KEI AND HWASA DID SO GOOD OMG STAN THEM BOTH
=
BILLIE NEEDS TO SEE THISSSS AHHHHHH
=
3:24 meme
=
와 화사 음색.. ㄷㄷ 흐어어엉
=
The girl at 3:40 explains my actual mood with Hwasa YES
=
i guess i'm the only comment talking about what an excellent job kei did + she looks so beautiful
=
yes Im interpreting this performance as two gay girls singing this about each other because they don't realize the other likes them back
=
Okay I knew about Hwasa's existence and even watched few of her fancams on Twitter. But DAMN HER VOCALS!!! I F*CKING ASCENDED TO HEAVEN.
=
They were 1st OMG!!?
=
wishing for studio version of this cover
=
Kei did great tho
=
All of us Moomoo's be like 3:39
=
Park Bom was my mood
=
Hwasa said gay I feel blessed af
=
0:26 ♡
=
Bom didn’t even move JEHSHWJSJ
=
0:14😂😂😂
=
Hwasa 😍😍😍
=
HWASA OMGGGG
=
OOF WELL WISH GRANTED I'M GAY
=
I really, really liked!!!!!
=
Perfect duo. PERIODT.
=
QUEEN HWASA!!!!!!
=
Hwasa wah good job.
=
1:25 I am 100% lesbian for Kei 🤩
=
Hwasa's Voice and make up style make me crazy😭💗💗💗
=
kei is so good too 💓💓💓💓
=
Kei💘
=
hwasa you make me gay shut up 😭
=
Basically.. *HWASA* *NAILED* *IT*
=
Actually, this was my fav collab. I kinda wish Kei had more lines( even tho i know they got same amount lol). I guess i wd love her to sing the whole song. her voice is so beautiful. ,( not saying hwasa's not, but there is sth in kei's voice that calls for me).
=
99% talk about hwasa voice
1% talk about Kei voice
People they are amazing please talk about their voices
=
Kei gives the ballad vibe while hwasa gives jazz vibe and I love it
=
화사는 진짜 타고난 연예인같다...  사람 눈길 집중시키는방법을 본능적으로 알고있는것같음
=
Hwasa wish I was gay?

Welp I guess I’m gay😂
=
hwasa é linda mds
=
화사 첫소절 하고 사람들 반응 왜저렇게 웃기지ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 음방에서 저런 반응 처음 들어봐
=
hi so I’m gay now - thanks hwasa
=
wait KEI'S VOICE ISSO BEAUTIFUL SHE SHOULD SING NEXT TIME WITH THIS VOICEEE
=
Seriously Hwasa's stage presence, expressions through her face and voice and how she transforms everything into her authentic style never fails to impress me.
=
QUEEEEEEEEENS
=
화사 회사에서 따로 화사 저노래부르는거 무대든 뭐든 내줬으면 좋겟다 젭알;;;
=
해석 하시는 분이 빌리와 빌리의 곡 자체를 이해하고 해석한게 아니라 그냥 번역 처럼 한게 느껴지는 해석이네요. 저기서 우리의 대화는 우울해가 아니라

Hey,hey,hey 11번의 보낸 메세지 (읽씹) 을 말한건데 (보낸 메세지는 파란색이죠)
 10대 감성으로요
=
Did I mention how good Kei’s pronunciation and diction is. It sounds like she’s a fluent english speaker. Oh wait, is she?!
=
이번 기회에 화사는 완벽한 프로의 자세를 보여 준 느낌이고 케이는 새로운 발견인 것 같다 진짜 기대감이 확 증폭되는 것 같음 뭔가 너무 좋다 진짜 저번에 욕 먹는 거 보고 진짜 타팬임에도 속상했는데 진짜 잘됐으면 좋겠다 ㅠㅠ 아 진짜 저음 너무 좋아 좋아 너무...
=
케이도 생각보다 성숙한 음색이라서 놀랐고 잘 했는데, 화사가 너무 잘근잘근 씹어먹는다...
=
Hwasa over here making the female audience gay for her and making the male audience deepening their love for her!!
=
화사 진짜.. 음색도 개간지나는데 손짓 하나에도 간지가 철철 넘침..
=
화사는 노래잘하고 음색좋은거 알고 있는데도 들으면 진짜 고막 살살녹네 하...
=
Other idols: nervous on the stage
*Hwasa: Hun, I live here.*
=
Kei: Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation


Bae, you're EVERYONE's preferred sexual orientation with that voice
=
Hwasa was like just wake up wearing a sweat suit then her manager ask her to perform and she NAILED IT
=
seriously no one talk about kei? she also do amazing job!
=
진짜 이 노래를 빌리보다 잘 소화하는 사람은 화사가 처음임.. 표정 몸짓 음감 음색 완벽히 본인맛대로 응용해버림
=
마마무가 진짜 미치도록 대단한게
퀸덤+콘서트+불후의명곡+솔로앨범+컴백준비 를 한꺼번에 하면서
항상 최고의 무대를 보여준다는거,,,,
=
Kei really showed off the otherside of her
=
자기가 새로 하고 싶은 음악 적극적으로 찾아나서 이렇게 본때 보여준 케이 너무 멋있다. 새로운 시도 해보려고 나간 프로그램인데 자기가 해보고 싶은 거 적극적으로 푸시하는 게 뭐가 문젠지 모르겠음. (여기 댓글이 그렇다는 게 아니라 곡하고 파트너 선정 때 말이 많았어서 하는 말입니다)
=
노래가 화사를 불렀네 근데 케이 진짜 잘한다 대박
러블리즈가 시험 한번 망칠 수 도 있지 다음에 잘하면 된다고 그랬는데
이제 사람들이 식스센스로 너무 뭐라안했으면..
=
Still, Billie Eilish are the best singer anyway
=
I'm gay for her
=
Suspeitoso ver  Hwasa cantando essa música.
=
Studio version plzzzzzz
=
Hwasa: I just kinda wish you were gay


Me: Well now I am!
=
KEI’S GAZE THO AHDJDKANFSJF I’M BOUT TO STAN
=
I haven’t kept up with Lovelyz in a while and I didn’t even recognize Kei at first, she looks so amazing with blonde hair
=
The blondie has a such a beautiful voice
=
I love Hwasa's voice
=
Their english was like really good, holy shit. I’m super impressed.
=
OMG THE BLONDE GIRL (Kei I think ?) SHES SO STUNNING IM DEAD KILL ME RIGHT NOW STEP ON ME I STAN 
The other one (Hwasa?) is also so amazing I cantttt——
=
Oh My God!! Not a fan but Kei is slaying every note. ❤️❤️ Can I Stan her??
=
Kei vocals are amazing, but damn hwasa that stage presence, walking around like you own it , bravo, both queens
=
the amount of gayness in all of those reactions.......... I'm LOVING THIS!!!
=
HOLY GHOST i have that background as my phone lock screen, anyways stan these two talented queens
=
I just comeback here everyday after meal 😂😂😂
=
This video was in my recommendations for so long, and i avoided for a reason. Lol i knew this would happen
=

=
This was so good that it made me gay 😭😭😭 lol omg why are they sooo good?? I love it
=
So perfect💗💗💗💖💖

=

=
Kei and Hwasa totally killed it, I still have goosebumps
=
At first I taught it was Moonbyul HAHAHAHAHA😂💞
=
I LOVE YOU HWASA!!! LOVE FROM MEXICOOOOOOOOOOOO *-*
=

=
This was actually amazing!
=
3:24 me watching this
=
this seriously needs to get viral! this is legendary, 2 queens performing together
=
Love love ❤
=
Who is this girl with my baby. She sounds amazing
=
i love their voices, but i feel like they didnt really capture the mood of the song. still killed it tho :)
=
I thought that I can sing this song well, but now I questioned it xd
=
Kei and Hwasa made such a good duet 😍😍
=
Well, your wish came tru; I‘m gay for both of them now
=
KEI N HWASA R VOCAL QUEENS U CANT CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE
=
Hwasa finna kill me tf. Girl I can't
=
Kei and hwasa both killed it 🔥🔥🔥 their voice literally blend well together
=
Hwasa and Billie singing would kill me. 😭😭
=
KEI DESERVES MORE LOVE AND ATTENTION FROM THIS
=
1:03 said 👁️👄👁️
=

=
♥︎great team and great performance♥︎
=
Hwasa: (breathes)
Me: 3:23.




Why is Park Bom so relatable and cute! 😂❤️
=
너무 화사만 보임... 민니랑 했으면 더 좋았을듯
=
Hwasa Queen👑
=
I'm in love fvck
=

=
Im bisexual for Hwasa😔
=
OHMYGOODDD
=
*Me sale este vídeo en recomendados*

¡Esto es real hijo!.jpg
=
hwasa！！！！
=
Hwasa, por que essa música????????????
=
hwasa hace gay hasta a mí mamá 🤧💕
=
No one:
Park bom: 3:24
👁👄👁
=
HWASA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO GOOD
=
I THOUGHT THEY WERE HOLDING TAMPONS AT THE END ON THE VIDEO
=
Hey but kei performed really good! Appreciate Kei😔
=
I love hwasa omg
=
케이 노래 너무 잘한다 ㅎㅎ
=
jimin is so prettty!
=
i know they did not just do this🥺👊🏼💛
=
Idk how many times i watch this video😍😍
=
I am dead 😖 !!! That is sooo good 😍!!!
=
Perfeitas demais aaaaaaaaaaa
=
for you hwasa, i am.
=
Hwasa has a unique type of voice. Wonderful
=
I hope Billie sees this!!!
=
화사도 좋아하지만 이번영상에서 제일 킬링파트는 4:25~4:28이 아닌가 싶음..
=
KEI 😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
I’m crying
=
Bruhhhh Hwasa didn't need to wish. We're all gay for her even before. 😂😂😂😂
=
Can upload a full version without the others screaming?😣
=
how can hyejin owns every song she sings? i love her ;__; kei did so well, too!
=
I'm gay now hwasa unnieeeeee
=
😍❤🔥 She has a mix af rihanna's and sia voice 


Whos ? 

Hwasa
=
Ive re-watched this too many times to count but like, i JUST NOTICED HWASA WAS SITTING IN THE BEGINNING.

HOW DID I *JUST* NOTICE THAT
=
🌈❤️
=
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! WTF I'M GAY NOW UR WISH CAME TRUE
=
BRUHHH POWER MOVE OF THE CENTURY
=
i really wish you were gay hwasa
like
i really did 💔
=
hwasa is really just another level of talent, every move from her is breathtaking 😭
=
Hwasa's voice is just so beautiful
=
화사는 진짜 저런 노래가 젤 잘 어울림
=
0:44 나만 이런 끊어질듯 아슬아슬한 목소리 좋아하나ㅠㅠㅠ 처음엔 끊어질듯 위태롭다가 갑자기 묵직해지고 섹시하게 기교를 부리더니 자연스럽게 흘러가게 하는 걸 어떻게 가사 한 소절에 담는거야..? 천재라니까 우리애 천재 만재라고요
=
케이 미쳤다.... 너무잘해....
=
화사는 진짜 화사를보여줬고 케이가 오히려 반전이라서 더 잘보여준거같은 느낌
=
hwasa:  "I just wanna make you feel okay"

me: I'm not okay😌 do u expect us to be after this
=
왜케 알라딘이랑 자스민 공주같지...
=
We stan sis.
=
At 3:11 all Hwasa did was do a peekaboo and everyone is losing their sh*t, including me.
=
빌리 최애곡인데 화사가 진짜 잘살린 느낌이다....빌리가 워낙 색깔이 뚜렷한 아티스트라 기대를 많이안했는데...
=
3:10 I'm so selfish 정면샷 안잡힌게 천추의 한이다
=
케이 진짜 진짜 예쁘게 생긴것 같다. 그냥 쇼프로그램에서 봤을 땐 별로 눈길 안 갔는데 퀸덤 이번화 보고 뭔 움직이는 인형인줄
=
Hwasa’s tone...I want to see this whole song covered by her so much, and they are both killing it
=
Hwasa proved herself and kei broke her stereotype! Is this not the best vocal team. They got the chemi and the voice of Queens!! 
😆😆go 95!
=
even tho i don't like the song they made it sound good, plus kei is a blessing <3
=
와 화사 진짜 미친거 아니야......
=
no offense but i dont know kei is that good???? hope she gets more recognition!!!!
=
케이도 잘했는데 저런 잔잔한 노래에서 화사는 압도적인 음색이다ㄷ
=
How can hwasa sounds like heaven..
=
화사 목소리, 표정, 제스처 다 너무 좋다 최고야
=
이번에 퀸덤에서 러블리즈 케이 예인이라는 보석을 찾은 느낌이라 너무 행복합니다.. 항상 러블리즈 컨셉은 달달 상큼이라 몰랐던 케이의 여러 음색이랑 예인의 무용실력 잘 봤어요 😭😭
=
화사x케이 대박이다!!
회가 거듭할수록 열심히하려는 케이 화사 
응원합니다 흥하자 !!
=
Hwasa looks ready to be arrested for the crime of killing us with her beauty and talent
=
화사는 나른하게 읊조리는 느낌이고 케이는  상대한테 절절 매달리는 느낌인듯🤔 케이도 잘했는데 화사버전만 보고싶기도함..
=
I gay panicked at Hwasa's first note. IM NOT EVEN A LESBIAN
=
화사가 이 노래랑 찰떡이긴한데 케이도 새롭게 도전하는 노랜데 정말 잘 어울린다ㅜㅜ 케이도 칭찬 많이 들었으면
=
hwasa & kei: i just kinda wish you were gay
me: yup but i am already--
=
화사 진짜 대박이다,,,, 저런 인재가 많아졌으명
=
케이 진짜 안정감있고 단단하면서 사람 녹이는 음색.... 단아하다고 해야하나ㅜㅜㅠ 말로 표현못해 사랑해
=
Little do they know, they turned every girl group member in the waiting rooms gay. Also Kei is hot af and her eyebrow raise killed me.
=
솔직히 케이가 반전이커서 이부분에선 더좋았던거같아 목소리도 매력있는지 이노래듣고알았음
=
hwasa just proved that she is the best
=
Hwasa's way of singing hides her accent and I'm like damn gurl she has a great voice and stare.
=
와 케이는 식스센스때랑 너무 달라보인다,,
=
Hwasa’s voice damnnnn
=
Hwasa is my queen. Ooooof, I love her
=
I wish Hwasa will do a full cover 💕
=
Solar looks like a proud mum. 😂💙
=
Hwasa said the line only once in the entire song but my gay ass still felt that cuz I JUST KINDA WISH YOU WERE GAY
=
I wasn't ready for Kei in that kind of song I'm mind-blowed and totally in love!!! 😍 This duet is hella perfect!!!!
=
Hwasa's great as always but BOI I was not expecting those low notes of Kei. I was always used to her bubblegum voice maybe.Nevertheless, both of them slayed this. ❤
=
Yes that what I said that I liked the vocals
=
4:15 is me throughout the vid HAHAHAHAHA
=
I just love her❤️
=
Now, i fall in love with Billie Eilish
=
I just love Hwasa....💗💗💗
=
can we talk about kei for once ? she's so perfect omg ???
=
케이 wish you were gay 파트 목소리 너무 좋다 😭🥰
=
케이 gay 발음을 너무 쎄게한다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Ma queen hwasa :')/
=
Hwasa❤️
=
The best cover ever💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
=
Hwasaa 💕. 2nd queen after ailee 💕💕💕💕💕
=
damn i didnt expect them to perform a song like this in korea
=
how can kei be that perfect?
=
3:24 I'm sorry but I laughed x'D
=
billie taking over korea
=
Ok damn Hwasa
=
Hwasa sending goosebumps our way. ❤️🥰♥️💕
=
QUEEN HWASA!!?!
=
i was like woooooohhhhh even just tumbnail only
=
화사는 말해 머해고 케이도ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠ넘무 잘ㄹ햇서ㅜㅜㅜ
=
Well I'm gay for you..hwasa..
=
So the conclusion is that this performance is gonna make you soooo intrested to see the original version of it🙄💞💞 I mean WHAT A MASTERPIECE👍🏻😢💕
=
Hwasa, if you see this. I AM gay so... Would you marry me?
=
진짜 생각날때마다 보러 오는디 울림 빨리 러블리즈 컨셉 바꿔서 내줘 제발 개잘할것 같아
=
do they understand the words or-
=
my bias singing my fave artist's song. Heaven or Hell
=
For me kei ❤❤❤
=
Damn, Kei's voice is so freakin angelic and Hwasa's charisma is freakin over 9000 😂
=
I'm blown away, OMG
=
I GOT SO MUCH CHILLS FROM THIS I-
=
hwasa what are you doing to me?!!!!!! sthapppp it
=
kei look pretty here
=
Whaaaat?! Is the title real?!
=
They are the best duo idk♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
=
원곡보다 이게 더 좋음..
=
Perfect
=
보컬적으로 둘의 차이는 없는듯
개인적으로 특정장르에 더 나은거지 
전체적으론 비슷하고 잘 어울림
=
HWASA 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
=
i'm getting goosebumps 
???
=
Hwasa, namjoon and jungkook would make a good team
=
Proud of hwasa. She perform without make up guysss
=
I've never felt gayer.
=
Kei's voice is so deep OMG
=
she did the 
"all u do is look the other way OOoOooo"
=
I'm so gay for them...
=
와 진짜 미쳤다 화사는 뭐 그냥 말할것도 없고 케이 저렇게 노래 잘부르는지 몰랐네.....
=
나는 세 팀 중에서 이 둘 조합이 젤 좋다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 목소리가 서로 안 어울릴 것 같았는데 의외로 너무 잘 어울림ㅠ 이거 들으러 유튜브 온닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ빨리 음원 내죠..
=
Can i get a full video of them singing without any reaction?
=
화사 미쳤다... 진짜 보면서 감탄을 몇번이나 한건지..
=
As a huge Hwasa stan I can't help but give KEI the same amount of love right now???? They're so amazing wow and both have amazing stage presence we stan
=
хваса,просто богиня
=
화사도 저 정도면 알지 않을까 자기 목소리는 
개꿀이라는걸
=
Kei is so gorgeous
=
여기가 보컬맛집이로구나.. 케이화사 쩐다
=
화사는 단순히 음색만 좋은게 아니라 성량도 크고 실력도 좋아서 너무 좋다
=
화사는 무대에 푹빠졌다가 나오는 게 보여서 너무 신기해요. 모든걸 화사화 시키는 느낌 ㅠㅠ  그리구 화사만의 무대에서의 여유는 항상 볼때마다 너무 좋음.
=
other idols: WOW SHE'S SO AMAZING SKJBAFLFA;
park bom: *quiet amazed gaaaaaaaaze*
=
but kei’s “i can’t tell you how much i wish i didn’t wanna stay” is so powerful and of course hwasa continues to make me question my sexuality
=
I’m gay
=
Kei : " i wanna try something different"

Hwasa : " let's show the real of you Kei....  😏"

Me: damn! I am a gay for this 4 minutes 😍 you guys blend and harmonized 😍😍😍😍😍
=
혜진아... 도대체 진짜 목소리로 바로 사람을 없던 추억도 만들어주니... 눈빛 하나하나에 치이잖아ㅠㅠㅠ 작은 손짓 하나에 자꾸 심장이 벅차잖니 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 작곡가님들 ㅠㅠㅠ 저 둘을.. 저 멋지고 멋지다 못해 빛이나는 둘을 유닛으로 음반 내주세요ㅠㅠ
=
케이 맨날 가는 목소리만 듣다가 음색 너무 좋아서 깜놀함 ㅠㅠ 이 음색으로 많이 불러줬으면 좋겠다
=
My angel hwasa
=
화사가 진짜 만능이네 목소리 오지고 ㄹㅇ
케이는 이런 곡이 잘어울렸네 역시 자기 보이스 활용만 잘하면  진짜 괜찮은데
왜 식스센스를 골라 핵폭탄이 되버려가지거 ㅠㅠ
=
Hwasa baby don't wish I was gay. I'm already gay ~ () ~
=
화사 "I just wanna make you feel okay" 이부분 끝장나다 진짜....................
=
Bom in 3:24: *questioning her whole sexuality*
=
kei my goddess
=
Hwasa is perfect but I feel like other girls voice was shaking in the beginning.
=
화사는 진짜 미쳤다 화사는 정말 ,,,,,,,  분위기가 도랐음 음색도 너무 멋있고 그냥 동작 하나하나에 숨멎함
=
Hwasa is so charismatic
=
Just for Hwasa, ill be gay
=
Aaaaii caralho,arrasaram
=
What show is it??
=
아니 화사 목소리 소름.. 진짜 왜케좋은겨 ,, 저런노래 솔로로 많이 내줬으면...
=
Park boms cute face tho
=
in the original recording of billie word "gay" is like slipping through words in harmony, but kei made it so strange to hear. i don't really know how to explain it but it sounds so strong, more like "kei" (lmao)
=
Ok. I agreen with the title. I wish a was gay too
=
I don't wanna be rude, but I actually prefer Kei's singing in this song. Idk I think it just fits better with the theme.
=
케이 음색 무슨 일이야 정말 난 지금껏 보석 겉핥기나 하고 있었나 이런 노래 또 불러줬으면 좋겠다
=
*wish you we're gay* 

MANY DO WISH THAT YOU ARE HWASA
=
3:40 you can tell she’s really in love with Hwasa😂💀
=
I’m officially gay and in love with hwasa
=
I'M I"M LITERALLY GAY FOR HWASA!!!
=
김케이 사랑해 ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 너의 음색 모든것을 다 ,,,전부,,
=
3:40 me enamoré Alv
=
Omg Hwasa THISSUU IS AN AWESOME COVER
=
My only impression of Kei was just Oppaya…But now…
=
hwasa makes me feel gay when i'm already gay
=
4:15 Literally me watching this
=
Please :((( I need an official audio from Hwasa cover this song. It's just so so so good :(((
=
Kei's interpretation for this song was amazing, it giving it a more sadness and aggression, I totally loose it in her part" Preferred sexually orientation" And "wish you were a gay"... It's like she is expressing her anger and sadness loudly.... And it was the opposite of hwasa that expressed the anger and the sadness as if she was depressed and done with life especially in her part " Okey" That was greatly cool.... They both gave a new soul to this song with the duality of opposite but harmonious feelings, the whole performance was like temptation and going up with Kei and down with hwasa... This is perfect  ❤ ... Try to see things, especially art, out of the box, and you will understand it better... Covers ain't about being like the original, it's not a copy.... So stop saying hwasa did better, or Kei did better...  Give yourselves the opportunity to enjoy
=
Kei really have a good control. That's so good
=
Hwasaa <3
=
My QUEEN HWASA
=
I LOVE BILLIE AND MAMAMOO <3
=
6 days had passed I’m still here
=
I love their English pronounciation
=
Hwasa is killing it like always but i’m still shocked, and kei’s performance here also got me stunned
=
My life has been leading up to this moment
=
They nailed it! Love this duo❤
=
1:03 3:25 Me just idolizing Hwasa as she steals all the girls 😮
=
화사 날가져..... ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅠㅠ미쳤덩 ㅠㅠ 넘멋쪄
=
화사 미쳤누ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
마지막에 화사 목소리 낮게 깔리는거 너무좋다...
=
THEY ARE PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER 💚💚💚
=
둘다 음색 미쳤다... 케이 노래 저렇게 잘 하는지 오늘 처음 알았음
=
케이님도 진짜 잘하시는거같음
=
HWASAAAAAAAA!
=
I don’t know if I’m bisexual, but I’m Hwasa-sexual for sure 😍 and Kei was amazing ! I was there for Hwasa but I’ll rewatch it for Kei ❤️
=
01:52 랑 03:11에 화사 제스쳐 너무 좋아... 언니 간지로 나라 세워
=
케이님도 너무 잘부르시고 잘어울리시는데 화사 혼자 부른거 음원듣고싶다..
=
AHHHHHHHH 💕❤️💕❤️💕
=
Hwasa's vocals is so damn sexy.
=
화사 케이 1등 각
=
케이 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
HWASA I LOV U SO MUCH
=
Cover billie so gooddddd.
=
KEI OMG I LOVE U
=
Hwasa........I'm gay for u
=
QUEEN 💕💕💕💕💕
=
Omg Kei and Hwasa Duet😭💜💜
=
I'm a gay for Kei yeaahhhh
=
Annd that right there is me Dead on the ground. w o w
=
KEI I LOVE YOU
=
Does any one notice the official color of TWICE??
Also matches the song (wish you were "GAY")
=
I just kinDA WIsh YOu wERe KEii!!!!
=
I love kei ♡
=
that girl that had her hands in fists under her chin....same
=
BITCH AAHHH
=
Hwasa's voice  make me so crazy.
=
Hwasa with her soul unique voice and kei with her soul bold voice is LITTTT🔥🔥
*I LOVE BOTH OF THEM!!!!!*
=
No one talk about kei
=
eilish needs to see this stgu
=
Strongly questioning my sexuality after watching this WTF HWASA AND KEI!!
=
dont let loco see this!!
=
Hwasa  singing is very good
=
a saw the title "wish you were gay" clicks immediately
=
Im supposed to be studying rn.😡
=
아 ....맞다..내 숙제...
=
Someone help me stan
=
역시나 화사의 리드 미쳤고, 케이도 역시 음색 엄청 좋네요. 청순한 이미지에서 변화를 주고 싶으면 이런 변화는 항상 옳은 정답이죠. 아예 반대성향의 무대를 보여주는게 아니라. 본인이 가진색깔을 살리는 방향으로
=
why does there voice was so unique on there own ways plus the soulful voice that can attack your mind , and soul hahaha!!!
=
최정아 기자 닮음
=
KEI'S VOICE IS GIVING ME CHILLS OH MY LORD
=
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS AAAA
=
I love bom’s gag face
=
Kei was amazing and the other girl too 💓
=
케이 노래 진짜 잘한다..
=
저 두명이서 이세상 여자들 다꼬실수있다
=
케이도 진짜 잘하는데 화사 진짜 오진다
음색,제스쳐 미쳤어그냩
너무 좋아 ㅜㅜ
=
Hwasa have always had the Billie sound in her. Low raspy notes, effortless/careless vibe, angelic falsettos... so her nailing this song was already established.
Kei however, has always opted for the ballad type of songs so her trying something like this is phenomenal!! she sounded soo good and did not get overshadowed by Hwasa's presence. I hope she gets more chances to be experimental with song choices in the future. She has got a wonderful voice
=
G. D is the 👑 of K-pop 
Now we have a queen Hwasa...
=
Hwasa and Kei are really powerful cause this makes me feel very gay.
=
케이 노래 저렇게 부르는거 진짜 좋다..ㅠㅠ 케이 원래 노래 잘하는데 식스센스때문에 실력으로 까이는거 슬픔
=
Hwasa’s voice is so suitable for Billie Eilish’s songs 😍
=
와 화사때메 소름끼침 대박 ... 목소리부터 찰떡이다 이 곡에
=
I almost choked when I read the title, but then I remembered the song is not actually about being gay, and is just about some girl who can't accept the guy doesn't like her, as if he needs a reason for not accepting her feelings, like being gay is the only reason someone wouldn't want her.
Oh well.

They still slayed tho oh my god and wHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT KEI???
=
Hwasa made me gay periodt
=
지연이하고 화사 둘다 음색 미침 둘이 케미 개좋누
=
케이 목소리 너무 좋다..케이 목소리 저렇게 절절한지 몰랐음ㅠㅠ
=
화사 칭찬밖에 없네 ㅠㅠ 케이도 잘했어
기존에 하던 분위기랑 많이 다르게 하려고 노력한 것도 보이고 케미도 새로워서 둘다 잘했음
=
케이 목소리 글리나 디즈니 하이틴 드라마에 나올 것 같은 음색이다.. 낮게 깔았는데도 진짜 맑은 목소리 ㅠㅠ
화사는 그냥 말할 것도 없음 창법도 그렇고 음색도 그렇고 진짜 팝송가수 같음 ㅜㅜ 솔직히 화사 해외진출 솔로곡 하나 내야할 것 같음
=
0:25 다른 유닛 무대 잘만봤으면서 혜지니 한소절 하고 도니까 웃는 기묭선 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 서로가 서로를 제일 사랑하지만 징그러워하는 그룹 매매뮤
=
케이 식스센스무대보다 이런무대보니깐 실력이좋네요
화사는 말할것도없음 걍 가수라는단어 찰떡
=
Hwasa 
WALK SCREAM
BREATH SCREAM
LEG MOVE SCREAM
CLOSE HER EYES SCREAM

QUEEN INDEED 👑
=
시작부터 심장 죽이고 가는 화사언니 ,,
=
화사 지분율 90프로
=
화사 음색은 진짜 널리 전세계적으로 퍼져야한다 .........
=
왜 보컬멤버들이 화사랑 하고싶어했는지 알게되는 영상... 음색이 그냥 사기다 진짜
=
아니 ㅋㄱㄱㄱㄱ 댓글이 다 화사님얘기밖에없엉 ㅋㅋㄱ
KIE님도 잘하셨구 화사님도 잘하셨어용 !
=
AGUANTE BILLIE
=
빌리아일리시도 좋고 케이도 젛은데... 화사목소리로 전곡듣고싶다....

=

=
AAAAAA ABWJWJWUWUAJJSJW

=
QUEEN HWASA THAT SONG WAS MADE FOR HER AND HER LOW REGISTER AT THE END OF THE SONG HOLY CRAP THAT WAS HOT
=

Hwasa’s voice is really something. Respect
=

=

=

=
HWASA IS BEAUTIFULL  😍😘😋
=
10000000 thumbs up for this video tbh im in love and even more gay
=
hwasa is so underrated bro, she has the best voice in kpop in my opinion, it's sweet and beautiful, so warm and powerful at the same time, i wish people start giving her more recognition because she deserves it a lot!! she's very talented
=
3:40 hwasa & kei making straight girls fall for them, 2019 colorized.
=
If loco saw this he would be dead
=
ok i'm gay
=
태연과 화사를 배출한 
전주는 대체 어떤 도시입니까.
=
HELLOOOO THE FACT THAT THEY SANG THIS SONG ON NATIONAL TELEVISION???????????? OH MY GOD this almost brought tears to my eyes IM SO PROUD OF U GIRLS
=
화사 목소리는 묵직하고 걸크느낌이라면 케이는  얇고 청순한목소리라서 둘이 같이 노래부른다고 했을때 쫌 알어울릴꺼라 생각했는데 생각보다 너무 잘어울려,,
=
Hwasa really dominated this performance no doubt about that
=
Kei slayed that sexual orientation part damn
=
Pretty
=
As much as i love hwasa, i hope the audience cheered for them both equally, because both of their stage presence really spectacular ~!!!
=
케이 세상 다시보임
=
엥 케이 이런 쩌는 여자를 그동안 핑크핑크러블리하트뿅뿅 컨셉에다가 파합파합 창법에 가둬놓았다닝...
=
Is She Park Bom?
=
화사는 진짜 끼가 미쳤다 아이돌 하려고 태어났어,,
=
둘이 목소리 진짜 잘어울린다ㅠㅠㅠ 처음에는 걱정했는데 우리 케이 이런 노래 어울리는지 새삼 깨달은듯 ㅠㅜ 둘이 마지막에 마주보는데 설레서 오열할 뻔 ㅠㅠ
=
케이가 힘들어할때 화사가 도와줬는데 이제는 케이가 도와주고 같이 이겨내고 너네가 뭐라든 신경안써 우린 우리야라고 하는 느낌
=
OMG
=
케이 눈썹올릴때 난 죽었다...
=
Who u wish was gay Hwasa?
=
Hwasa dynamics tho! She's so good on controlling her voice.
=
im not gay but this dope 💯 hwasa can get it
=
Mw estas jodiendo NOOOOO!!!!!😍😍😍👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
=
케이 목소리 반전이다 이런 목소리도 갖구있었구너...
=
Bro Kei ate that song
=
We all know Hwasa's really good but damn Kei got me in this performance right here!!! I really love how she projects while singing and damn her voice was so good!!! I think I'm about to stan lovelyz
=
gak dapat feelny, di cut2 mulu, kesel
=
MAMAMMO tus patronas
=
This is my first time seeing Kei sing this kind of song and I love her singing voice so much. She's not Lovelyz main vocal for nothing. So powerful and sweet. 🥀
=
AAAAAAA
=
Mi conclusión : son todas re tortas y amo eso ah que decía la loca
=
Kei's voice at 2:40 was so smooth and strong
=
Hwasa and Kei are like the 2 sides of a girl: swagger and soft/emotional at the same time. Hwasa’s tone is perfect for the song and she really knows how to relax and enjoy the stage. Kei’s voice is beautiful and more in control/safe side of the stage. They did really well, I can see 2 typical girl with the same “heartache”
=
세상을 자유롭게 살아가는 화사와,
세상을 반듯하게 살아가는 케이의 하모니~!!
=
Hwasa and Kei: I just kinda wish you were gay


Me: well so i'm gay
=
Don't worry hwasa, I'm gay...for you
=
......We Stan Queens
=
We saw another side of Kei with this performance and ya knowhat? heR VOCALS SLAYED IT Y'ALL IT REALLY COMPLIMENTED WELL WITH HWASA'S VOICE srsly they should win
=
Hwasa is no doubt my queen 💯i wanna be like her
=
HWASA never fails on giving me goosebumps 🥴😭❤️😭❤️😭 what a QUEEN!!!!!
=
Hwasa' s voice is 😍
=
This performance made me even gayer 😭💖💖
=
Luv this it's just so chill 💕
=
2:54 just cleared my skin
=
3:24 My princess✨💗
=
hwasa's voice is perfect
=
Amazing rendition by both girls! Kei's vocals is soooo clear, i love it! But i wish she won't close her eyes all the time.

Meanwhile Hwasa...😍😍😍*silent scream*
=
Im gay for Hwasa omg 😂😂
=
Hwasa never fails to amaze me 🤩🤩🤩🤩
=
와..화사.. 그냥 안혜진이 씹어먹어부럿네잉..
=

=
Perfect
=
I LOVE YOU 3000 언니 ♥️
=
Bom Is so cute 💕💕
=
케이야 또 보러왔다
=
I love the fact that Kei said she learned a lot from Hwasa and how they helped each other to improve. This is the thing that I want from Queendom where the girls exchanging their experiences and improve their skills together, no actual competition just having fun. Anyway good job to the both of them. Applause for Kei for being brave to challenge herself trying new styles and applause for Hwasa too for staying humble and helpful to the people around her. Much love for the girls ❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
MY WIG IS SNATCHED
=
케이도 되게 잘했는데 화사 얘기만 나와서 아쉽다 케이 되게 잘했어요 !!!!
=
mood 4:15
=
Holy MOLY

=
I love Hwasa’s Voice but Kei deym that girl is one of the cutest idol is dat deymm hawt, let’s appreciate her underrated vocals
=
LESBIANS THIS IS OUR ANTHEM
=
MY BOTH BIAS!!!! MAKCNSKX IM GAY FOR U TWO
=
I hope i have their voice
=
here for kei 🥰🥰
=
yall someone tell Billie, shed cry
=
This is wat you u called tru singers
=
Tbh, Kei did a good job here. But I truly want a solo version from Hwasa. Her voice is just pure gold.
=
Literally died when hwasa sang  I just wanna make you feel ok at the start, tho I've never heard about Kei before, she is very impressive, feel gay for.both of them lmao
=
가사해석이 약간 틀린게 "gay"가 게이인 뜻도 있지만 행복이란 뜻으로도 쓰이거든요. 제 생각엔 이 노랜 게이보다 행복 했으면 좋겠다는 의미가 더 강한 섯 같아요. 물론 게이라는 뜻도 있지만요.
=
BEAUTIFUL
=
I NEED TO KNOW FROM WHAT GROUP IS KEI
=
two queens
=
kei and hwasa, you're doing great sweeties
=
Kei just become gai since Kwasa made her.
=
my bb hwasa nailed it aaa
=
IM SORRY BUT THIS SONG WAS MADE FOR THEM
=
i just kinda wish you were kei
=
*_im already gay for hwasa tho_*
=
Audio pls.
=
솔라표정 무슨 화사보고 '쟤 또또 시작이다ㅋㅋㅋ'이런 느낌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
와 화사 목소리 진짜 쩐다
=
Yesssssss
=
화사도 그렇고 케이도 진짜 미쳤다.. 분위기 확 바뀌는거 너무 멋있어..
=
I'm so soft for Hwasa
. Literally, she's the queen in this generation
=
" Six world yo-"


Ads : I blinds for your love~
=
케이 너무 잘한다
=
케이도 예전에 비하면 엄청 잘했는데 이번에 화사가 너무 셌다
=
Let’s appreciate my other wife Kei too yalls
=
I think Kei's voice really is suited for this kind of song and vibes. Her voice is so powerful
=
Me throughout their performance: 

Goosebumps

Goosebumps

Goosebumps

Goosebumps

Death
=
I love Hwasa's voice so much it hurts.
=
Kie’s voice is so beautiful it’s sound like a melting gold and hwasa is so amazing she has a strong talent love the both of them sooooooo much 🔥🔥💥😍😍
=
Im gay for Hwasa
=
Kei voice is like a disney princess
=
OMGFF
=
화사가 부르는 부분에서 갑자기 딥해짐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Im gay for hwasa.
=
ALL the comments are about hwasa, and don’t get me wrong she KILLED IT, but can we talk about kei??? she also killed it
=
Hwasa and Kei: I did it for the gays and the girls that’s it
=
내일 화사 가을속에서 라는 신곡나와요
들 어 주 세 요 옹
=
케이도 진짜 잘했는데 왜 말이 없냐ㅜㅜ 예고편에서 섹시한거 하고 싶다고 한 뒤로 또 섹시냐, 너는 니가 잘하는걸 놔두고 왜 자꾸 섹시에 집착하냐 등등 이런 댓글 많이 보였는데, 이 노래는 나른한 느낌의 곡이랑 케이 음색이랑도 찰떡인듯 함...ㅜㅜ 이제 식스센스로 너무 걸고 넘어지지 말아줬음 좋겠다
=
화사 괜히 여자솔로 1위하는게 아니다ㅠㅜ진짜...
=
Why not many talk about kei? 🤔 She is very good. She is not over shadowed by Hwasa's charisma
=
Somewhere Loco is watching this totally love struck like “That’s my girl being her sexy self taking everyone’s breath away”🤷‍♂️
=
Why they sound nervous & out of breathe...
=
By billliieee eiiiillliiisshhh💖💖💖
=
It's a win for the GAYS
=
QUEEN
=
KEIIII 💓💓💓💓
=
esa cancion es de billie!!!!!
=
와 케이도 좋지만 화사가 이 노래 전체 커버한 거 들어보고 싶다 음색 진짜 너무 잘 어울려 연말에 빌리랑 콜라보 해주세요....
=
아진짜 노래 감상좀 하고싶은데 왜자꾸 중간중간 반응넣는거임 짜증나게
=
this kinda good tho since *ALL OF BILLIE EILISH SONGS* ARE HARD TO SING IF YOU DIDNT HAVE UR OWN VOICE COLOR
=
Hwasa I'm so gay for you you don't have to wish
=
Who is 3:24 ????
=
다른 그룹은 화사 몸짓하나에 우워워워하는데 마마무만 편안해보여ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Im not hate hwasa and kei but for me ( park bom is the best vocal)
=
OMG
=
I just kinda wish you were Kei
=
Why is no one else talking about Kei?? She literally killed it‼️
=
Good god....hwasa hits this song differently. This is my favorite song and she sang it so much like billie, but distinctly hers. Oh god, i really love hwasa!!!!!!
=

=
Yasss KEI!!!!!
=
화사는 천재인 듯
=
홀린 듯이 계속 들어오고 있어요… 중독됐나봐…
=
이 노래는 화사  노랜데요 둘다 잘하지만  화사님에 느낌이 강렬한듯
=
3:40 that girl is a BIG mood
=
I die😂😂😂💗💗💗 I 'm love it.
=
I just kinda wish you were 'kei'  EYYY
=
Watched because of Hwasa, sexuality crushed by Hwasa. A Y E
=
Beatifull 😭😍😍
=
미친 십 내가 제일 좋아하는 노랜데 이거 와 ㅅㅂ 개행복해
=
lol bom is so cute 🥰
=
好棒ｂ(￣▽￣)ｄ
=
ahhhhh hwasas stage presence is seriously no joke
=
Hwasa nailed ittttttt
=
(크라이즈 인 레즈비언 밈)
=
This was four and a half minutes of gay panic and I'm here for it
=
Kei ya!
=
Ahh que pedo que pedo?!? Me wa morir son perfectas y con la cancion de billie me muero uwu
=
gay? yes that is what I am
=
legends.
=
I wish that toooo
=
parkbom couldn't be any cuter
=
다들 거의 화사만 칭찬하는데 난 이 노래에서 케이의 그 깊은 목소리가 너무 좋음..
=
TT TTT YESSSSSSSS
=
OMG I-
=
hwasa is such a queen and omg this is the first i've heard of kei AND SHE IS AMAZINGGGG
=
I click cuz the title"i wish you were gay" i thought is gay's song😂😂

Kei wow 😍💗💗💗
=
Awhh....crazy😵
=
KEI AND HWASA SINGING "i just kinda wish you were gay" SENDS MY LESBIAN HEART OUT THE WINDOW
=
they did it for the gays
=
I really like the blonde lady's voice so much
=
Eventough this is LITERALLY NOT KEI'S STYLE
BUT SHE NAILED IT!
what of they sing something KEI'S style like Ballad with powerful emotion, she Will surely nailed it too..
But this performance IS TOP NOTCH SO..
GOOD LUCK KEI HWASA
=
Mhh this was kinda hot
=
화사님이 첨부터 끝까지 완곡 한 번만 해주셨으면 ... 🙏🏻
=
hwaaaasa
=
Hwasa's voice is so soothing and sexy but the other girl's voice took me by surprised. I love her already lolol 😍❤😂
=
Hwasa saying the words “I just kinda wish you were gay” makes my heart melt because I am gay and I wish you were too wowowowow
=
Ok but Kei deserved good crowd when she sings solo too
=
진짜 케이 화사 둘이 음색이 너무 잘어울림 둘이 완전 반대인데 어울리는게 완전 최고고 화사랑 케이 꽁냥꽁냥 잘지내줬으면 둘이 넘 최고ㅠㅠ
=
ตายไปเลยอ่ะ
=
2:54 와 화사 음색 미쳤음
=
화사보고 레이디가가 생각났음 ㅠㅠㅠ 오버하는 것 같긴한데 진짜 순간적으로 레이디가가 보였다.
=
🏳️‍🌈😊
=
둘다 곡 이해를 잘해서 잘 표현 한것 같음
노래가 좋아하던 남자가 날 안좋아해주니 사실 게이 여서 나한테 관심 없는거였으면 좋겠다고 합리화 하는 내용인데
두분다 애절한 듯 한 손 제스처를 너무 잘 활용 하셔서 집중 잘되네요
=
hwasa making everyone gay
=
빌리 특유의 흘러가듯이 힘뺐다 힘줬다 하는  창법을 화사가 정확히 파악하고 있네 ㅠㅜ 너무 잘한다 ,, 케이도 목소리가 예뻐서 빌리노래랑 잘어울린다 근데 진짜 화사 후반부로 갈수록 개소름이다 어떻게 저렇게 부르지
=
화사 진짜.......... 저런 목소리가 어떻게 나올 수 있는거야 진짜 와 미쳤어 노래 저렇게 쫜득쫜득하고 입에 찰싹 달라붙게 부르는 사람 진짜 처음 봄 이 노래 해석 진짜 잘하는 것 같아서 이번에 다시 한번 화사를 다시 보게 됐다
=
OMG KEI LOOKS SO DIFFERENT, SHES BETTER IN THIS IMAGE
=
Ok ok ok Kei and Hwasa KILLED IT.   
Hwasa's voice was so sweet and powerful, Kei's was clear and beautiful. Seriously, they make a perfect team.
=
Did Hwasa perform this without makeup? An absolute confident and beautiful queen
=
3:16 이거 무대에서 즉흥으로 한거같은데 카감 다급함이 보이는 카메라워킹같앜ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 즉흥이면 진짜... 혜진아..넌 진짜 천재야
=
화사진짜 너무 잘한다 케이도 엄청 깔끔하게 잘부르네ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 둘 조합 좋다
=
화사 미쳤네 개잘해~음색까지 미치게 좋아
=
Their voices match sooo well. Love that they enjoy the stage.
Hwasa x Kei hwaiting.
=
🧡🖤🧡🖤
=
KEI HAVE A PERFECT VOCAL
=
Kei typical gay : bogoshipda
Hwasa panic gay:... Na.. Nado

IS THIS SONG A HAZARD???
=
Hwasa is one of the reasons I’m gay
=
Bi and lesbian vibes all the way
=
Not everyone can be Hwasa and thats not ok...change
=

=
캬 시부럴 진짜 화사누님 목소리는 국보다 모기 목소리가 화사누님 목소리였으면 안죽이고 잡아다 키웠을듯
2:55 오지누;;;;;

=
Huum gay?
