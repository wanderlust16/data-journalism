=
Who like Moonbyul?
👇🏻
👇🏻
👇🏻
=
I'm not a big fan of Yooa, but her Smooth Criminal had me shook
=
I think soojin and yein performance is the most eye catching here. Still can't understand how some people choose...
=
Who like Soojin
👇
👇
👇
=
For me 


1 - Yein
2 - Yooa
3 - Soojin
=
I honestly think the ratings in this show don’t matter. Every group showed off and went boom on stage and got a lot of recognition and hype with new fans to boot.
=
Yein not getting top 2 shows that the Koreans like strong performances. Sad that they cant appreciate the beautiful of modern dance. I bet 99% of the comment section says that Yein got robbed big time.
=
I'm not even a Lovelyz fan, but Yein definitely deserved higher imo
=
more like moonbyul and her girlfriends seriously tho why is she such an oppa
=
Who is the first solo performer? She's gorgeous
=
9:26 I like how the lyrics goes "Your the man" then the camera focuses on moonbyul. I was like, damn right!
=
No one’s talking about Moonbuyl. They all did so good!
=
Hyejeong went "oh yeah" when soojin starts movin is a big fat mood
=
개인적인 순위
1.예인 소름돋게 잘했다
2.유아 멋있게 잘했다
3.수진 역시나 잘했다
=
Everyone complaining about Yein, when Eunji didnt even get a solo dance.
=
힘 - 찬미
표정 - 문스타
디테일 - 유아
춤선 - 예인
끼 - 수진
=
치지직.... 여기는 한국인 이글이 보이는 한국인 응답하라..
=
When Solar said, "She's here. She's here." 

She means: "Hide the girls, Moonbyul's gonna make them fall for her." 

And she's absolutely right. 👌
=
4:40 아진짜 개빡친 체리마루같다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅡ으흑흑 유아야 사랑해ㅠㅠㅜㅠㅜㅠㅜㅜㅜㅡㅜㅜㅜㅠ
=
Definitely enjoyed how clean Yein's performance is. She was so in sync with the male dancer and the music
=
대체 예인이가 왜 하위권인건데...? 나만 이해안가는거 아니지?
=
Who is the first girl with the red dress? She's freaking incredible
=
솔직히 말해서 정예인 무대가 너무 강렬해서 딴 게 생각이 안 나...
=
Yooa Killed them all let's not forget yein as well she deserved better
=
But how is this a real competition if Brave Girl's Eunji didn't get a solo?
=
Who's the Michael Jackson performance? I like her .
=
유튜브에 자국어 댓글 우선보기 있으면 좋겠다.....
=
The michael jackson dance was the best wow i didn’t expect it from that girl i thought oh my girl are the weakest dancers 😮
=
Everyone is wearing sexy clothes 
Meanwhile there's moonbyul..
=
아니 예인이 진짜너무잘했는데 순위뭐야 왜내가 다 속상함;ㅠ
=
*saw moonbyul in the thumbnail*

Me: *clicks quickly*
=
After I watched this I thought Yein is definitely in the top three...still don’t understand why she get rank four-_-
=
2 OF LITTLE MIX’S SONGS ARE HERE!! OMYGOOOOOOOOOOSH!!
=
But can we talk about Chanmi? Despite being an amazing dancer she was always hidden in AOA and Seolhyun stood in the center, leaving Chanmi to be completely ignored. FNC did my girl dirty, telling her that she's the main dancer just to never give her the chance to show her abilities. AOA being so proud of her is not only a reaction for the camera, but also genuine pride, Jimin saying "she did THAT" is her saying "yes, she deserves her spot in the group and deserves so much more recognition for her talent".

To conclude this: STOP SLEEPING ON AOA AND STOP SLEEPING ON CHANMI, JIMIN, YUNA, HYEJEONG AND SEOLHYUN
=
Why is no one talking about Eunji?? She is so good here and also, she is not in the dance line of her group. Unfortunately, she didn't have her own solo
=
다른 팀들은 자기 멤버 끝나면 환호하는데 마마무만 부끄러워햌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Yein and Eunji deserved better. Yein deserved to be in the top 3 and Eunji deserved a solo stage and more screen time. They were robbed.
=
Smooth criminal was the best nobody can’t deny
=
Moonbyul is coming for the girls she collects them better than the guy's Haha
=
난 솔직히 보면서 예인이 한테만 시선이 감.. 단체군무 할때 센터 아닐때도 얘가 너무 춤선이 이뻐서 계속 보게됨.. 난 예인이 같은 춤 스타일이 젤 좋아 너무 오바하지는 않으면서 그냥 되게 보기편함 ㅜㅜ유아도 짱멋있다ㅜㅜㅜ
=
예인 도입부가 소름돋게 미치긴하네 ㄷㄷ
=
예인 1위 아님 2위 할 줄 알았는데....기억에 젤 많이 남는 게 예인인데...
=
Im not yein fans but her dance here make me feel so lovely
=
Moonbyul doesnt show any part of her body but still looks hot and sexy
=
the fact that the camera zoomed on moonbyul's face when the song said "you're the man" 😂 byul oppa strikes
=
친절한 금자씨 대사를 함께 넣은 것은 신의 한 수였다. 너무 조흠....
=
퀸덤 보면서 느끼는건 잠... 마마무는 팬들..? 화력이 엄청나구나 싶음ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 댓글창부터 순위까지
=
솔직히금자씨랑 마이클잭슨밖에 기억에안박힘
=
thinking about how yooa was the only one on beat in this performance
=
The first performance was beautiful!! Who is she????????!
=
YEIN💃
YEIN💃
YEIN💃
YEIN💃
YEIN💃
YEIN💃
YEIN💃
YEIN💃
YEIN💃
=
개인적으로 1위 예인, 2위 유아, 3위 수진
=
Who,was the first girl dancing she was amazing absolute phenomenal
=
Can we talk about Moonbyul performance she was AMAZING !!!!!
=
Solar there being a proud mom to moonbyul lmao also the other members is LiFe XD
=
이번에 예인 캐리 크게 한듯 눈에 확 들어옴
=
정예인 4위 다시보고 또 봐도 이해가 안감,,,,ㅜㅜ
=
everyone has a crush on moonbyul and if you dont youre wrong
=
I cried, screamed,and got chills and goosebumps the first time i saw this. And i still do after.
=
Who's the 1st performer. I love her performance
=
When your the only multi kpop fan here. And loves all the dance solo.
Who loves all the solo. I hope its not only me
Edit: thnks for the likes my fellow multi
=
Yein and Yooa killed it brUh.
=
still bitter than Yein wasn't even a part of the top 3 after this amazing performance
all the other girls did amazing too but i just think Yein deserved more than what she ranked
=
시-발 정예인 콧대보이냐 저게 콧대라는것이다 내가 가진건 콧대가 아니고 코였던 것의 잔해고 와 쉬발 손대면 손모가지까지 날라갈거같네 슈발
=
This whole video just calling me a lesbian
=
_who loves, yein_
👇
=
10:20 like that dude was touching his scalp like, “Wait, did the queens snatch my wig???”
=
Yein is sooo fkn pretty
=
10:19 hes like: “did my wig already go..?!”
=
근데 이번건 문별이랑 이미지가 안맞는것같다
나만 그런지 모르겠지만
=
예인이랑 유아에서 진짜 홀린듯이 봄... 특히나 유아는 뭐라해야하지 느낌 살리기가 진짜 어려운 춤을 잘 살린게 대단하다고 봄
=
LOVELYZ YEIN deserves a higher ranking!!!! She deserves 2nd place
=
진짜 5명 모두 너무너무 잘했고 각자의 개성이 드러나서 좋은데 이걸 순위를 매겨버리니 순위밖에 기억에 안 남고, 결국은 팬들 맴에 상처만 생기는 것 같아서 넘나 맴찢임
=
still salty than yein didn't get second place
=
Who is the first performer? I really love her dance though. OMG. 😱
=
다른그룹은 자기멤버 오구오구하고 이쁘다고 칭찬일색인데 왜 마마무는 부끄러워하냐ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 계속 돌려봐도 웃기넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 하나같이 부끄러움에 몸둘바를 모르고있넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
5:01?

Sorry I'm questioning alot. 😂
=
Honestly moonbyul and Yein (first girl?) And yooA were great. I'm back watching this again and I realized many said moon missed steps when she really didn't and they said she didn't move as she should have or feminine for the type of song. Yet y'all clearly haven't seen moon dancing in MAMAMOO's regular choreo where they actually show moon dancing as "feminine" as the hwasa and the rest. Moon has a certain style that Chris brown or older r&b artists would do. She is graceful ,relaxed and smooth yet precise and sharp.  Soojin and the rest killed it but even for soojin ,her dancing was beautiful but pretty basic considering ik that queen has more in her. Some real salsa would have been nicer for her tbh. All the dances were beautiful but the sexy concepts are not the only concepts that exist. U can't fit dancers in a tiny little box,many come with their own flavor, for me that's why yooA -who was stunning and precise , yein- who was beautiful,emotional and graceful and moon- who was sharp, quick and precise stood out to me cuz I feel like their pieces were unique
=
나한테 1등은 예인 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ춤선 작살난다
=
first one is literally the best and i ont even know her
=
THIS QUEENDOM IS NOT A COMPETITION ANYMORE ....


IT IS MORE LIKE A QUALITY CONTENT KPOP HAS BEEN MISSING ALL THIS TIME !!! 

I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THIS BUT.......THANKS MNET
=
i stg moonbyul can have all my money. just take my whole three dollars i won't complain.
=
저 중에서 예인이 제일 기억에 남음 ..
=
Top 3 that should've been: Yooa 1st, Yein 2nd, Soojin 3rd
=
Who likes Yein ???
⬇️
=
The first girl and Michael Jackson is cool
=
10:24 MOONBYULLL THAT SMILE 😭😭😭😭
=
I think Ye-In is the Top
=
YEIN's dance is great, it's just she's lacking expression in stage, my favourite was YOOA.
=
For who haven't known that: Leader of this team is Moonbyul !
=
엠넷 쓸데없이 대국민 주작 오디션 하지말고
걸그룹들 모아서 같이 놀기 
걸그룹들 모아서 댄스경연 
걸그룹들 모아서 노래경연
걸그룹들 모아서 체육대회
걸그룹들 모아서 농촌체험기

=
YEIN YOU WON MY HEART😍💜
=
Although I’m definitely biased toward Mamamoo and AOA Yein and Yooa were definitely the best
=
예인아 사랑해 ♥️♥️
=
이번 무대는 레알 정예인이 찢었다.
친절한 금자씨에 현대무용이라니 한국인 취향 후려갈기네
=
Chanmi did so amazing, I was shooooooook.
=
I look at moonbyul is automatically no   I'm not straight anymore
=
Keep coming back to watch Yein's luxurious stage 😍😍
=
오늘 예인이란 애가 누군지 알고감.. 너무 예쁘고 표현도 잘했는디
=
soojin: are you fine?
moonbyul: still straight?
this two really attacked my sexuality
=
10:07 I'll just leave this here. Really good shot of Yein. The first time I saw it, I was truly infatuated.
=
my top
1 - 친절한 금자씨
2 - Senorita
3 - Smoorh Criminal
=
GUYS UM-







WHERE NOT IN FIFTH SEASON ERA ANYMORE IM SHAKING ISIWHWBEBWIDB
=
yein nailed it very hard
=
Yein: Elegant
Soojin : Sexy
Chanmi: Powerful
Yooa : Swag 
Moonbyul oppa : Girl crush 

Performance unit slay 🔥
=
Every time i come here, every time i watched this i never knw how many time i covered my mouth during YooA smooth criminal Performance..
=
2:27 BabySoul and Jiae looking like mommies already hahaha!
=
예인이 진짜 잘했는데 왜 5등ㅜㅜ이거 보고 나서 예인이 무대만 계속봤음 너무 잘했어.......
=
현장 안뛴애들이 꼭 말만 많더라 영상이랑 실제무대랑 다르니까 투표가 그렇게 나왔지
=
반응들이ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 각자 최애들이 다 무대를 찢었대ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
그렇게 무대는 갈기갈기 찢겨 사라졌다고 한다...
=
I can’t with byul’s extreme girl crush energy . I can’t with her eyes and her smirk 🤰🤰🤰🤰🤰
=
I am proud of Yein ❤️❤️❤️
=
omg YooA you were amazing you deserved everything
=
유아 일위인거 인정 근데 진짜 이위가 예인일것 같은데 진짜 뭐 4위?? 미칬나 무슨 팬덤 대결도 아니고 보여지는 무대 대결인데 ...ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
예인이 처음에 미소를 지다가 후반에 손으로 가리다 필때 정색을 하는데 그 의미가 친절한 가면을 쓴 아가씨가 가면을 벗을때 그 분노가 숨겨져있다는 의미인것 같아요. 영화 재밌게 봤는데 이걸 춤으로 표현한다는게 소름이 돋네요;;;;;;
=
I'm happy YooA got appreciated her deserve when the first time this video upload people just talking about Yein and Soojin and now when I read the comment they talking about YooA who did a great job with Smooth Criminal and Power. For the ranking you can't bring down YooA before you watch her fancam.
=
Yein  so beautiful..
=
나는 예인이가 정말 소름돋는게, 화려한 음악이나 조명이나 여러명의 백댄서 없이 저렇게 단조로운 현대무용으로 그냥 무대를 찢어갈김
=
Yein deserved 1st or 2nd defininitely. I can't believe she got any lower than that.
=
와 예인이 찢어놓은 듯 처음에 소름 쫙 돋음
=
I know I’m late but I’m literally crying for this , is beautiful how even if this is a competition they came together at the end 😢
=
OMG YEIN DID AMAZING
=
Yein is the best
=
의외로 문별, 찬미에 대한 이야기가 없네... 문별 부채춤 멋졌고 찬미 테이블을 이용한 댄스 참신한 퍼포먼스로 맘에 딱 들었는뎅 은지는 개인 무대가 없어서...
=
친절한 금자씨 진짜 개소름 돋았음...
=
For me: 

* × ☆ • ° ` Only Moonbyul ` ° • × * ~
=
솔직히 유아 처음 등장할 때 너무 귀염뽀쟉상이라서 매칭이 안 됐는데... 모자챙으로 얼굴 가리고 한 게 진짜 더 무대 몰입도를 높여준 거 같다
=
I hope they do this in mama 2019 
It will be so dope
=
1:49 that little “she’s so sexy” was amazing
=
Yein and YooA are definitely the stand outs for me. They performed something “different”. And by different that means outside of what they normally perform and show.
=
Seriously yein deserves number one
=
When moonbyul dancing, girls in clip smile so real.
=
Imagine Lisa Momo and Seulgi with them I cannot even😱😱😱😱😱
=
I really find it funny that on the Power part where Little Mix sings "You're the man", Moonbyul's face was shown 😂😂😂😂 such an oppa 🤣
=
이번무대 진짜 다 대박인데 삼대장은 예인 수진 유아다 ... 미쳤다진짜로
=
I'm Moonbyul and Soojin biased but their solos had the least impact on me. I love byul but hers was kinda messy and she kept missing the camera. I think they shined more during the group performance. Soojin killed it at center during power. Yein, YooA, and Chanmi stood out to me the most during their solos. I wish girl groups could do more things like this on the regular instead of every couple of years when they get the opportunity.
=
If all of them perform during mama2019, i would have watch the whole show... But no, only mamamoo was there 😞 i only watch mamamoo and wayv performance at mama2019 🙄
=
it's funny just how that part "your the man" showed moonbyul 😂
=
Yein unnie you number 1 in my heart💖😘love you so much 💞💕
=
이게 발캠이라 그렇지 실제로 보면 유아 되게 잘해요...다른 분들도 잘했는데 유아는 진짜 미쳤습니다ㅜ
=
When power started I literally turned off my phone and took a few minutes to recollect my thoughts and attempt to prepare for this-//
=
우리 유아 최고지만 예인 첫등장 미쳤다,, 친절해 보일까봐 나레이션 딱 나오는데 진짜 소름 돋았음. 다른 분들 등수를 비교하는걸 다 떠나서 예인 무대 너무 강렬해서 최소 2등은 할 줄 알았는데 솔직히 조금 의아했어요. 마지막 단체 군무에서도 예인 미모,,,
=
10:24 how does anyone watch moonbyul and not fall in love?
=
Yo the girl that danced first tho I love her moves and the elegance. She owned it
=
Yein 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱AMAZING 🔥💜
=
Cause of death :
The last part :)
=
5:58 太可愛了
=
1:12 did anyone saw soojin in the backgroun going to sit in the chair and being ready to kill us all
=
Who loves Soojin ???
 |
 |
\/
=
Yein, beautiful Yein ♡
=
ughh i keep coming back to this video because of yein and soojin performances
=
수진이가 젤 잘했다♡♡
수진바라기🌻
=
All of these girls, I still love Moonbyul AaaAAa My Girl Cruuuuush
=
서수진 미쳤음..표정 연기가 국보급임;;
=
YooA should be arrested she's a criminal.. because her move is so SMOOOTTTTHHHHH
=
so u guys are telling me that Yein only got 4th rank? what a joke, ffs
=
Everytime the members or the public reacts I'm just like "same" 
This was crazy amazing
=
Soojin’s stage presence is no joke😍
=
This has too much hotness, i can’t handle it ,I turned out to be gayyyy😍
=
yein so pretty my god💜
=
This stage made me feel so proud as a woman! I feel sooooo encouraged to bring my sexy side out !!!!!
=
네. 무무입니다.
근데 예인님 무대는 진짜 찐입니다.
유아님 왁킹도 쩔고여 
수진님은 입벌어지고여
찬미님은 눈이 커지고여
벼리는 표정쩔고여
백댄서들은 뭣같네여
=
SOOJIN OMG I'M TRYING TO BREATHE HERE
=
gahd, i was amazed by the first one who performed but i was disappointed that she doesn't make it to the top 3. How come!!!
=
YooA killed me with her beauty and dance skills T_T is a baby girl and the last outfit was so pretty ! ♥
=
*Seriously, I thought that Yein was competing in USA Dancing Competition...*
=
All of them did well but damn soojin killed me :")
=
예인이가 오프닝 진짜 잘한듯 기억에 많이 남고 유아가 진짜 잘하네
=
정예인은 예술이야... 미쳤어 최고야 너무 아름다워
=
Yein and her killer visuals....damn
=
아니 카메라 문별이 아무리 진짜 너무  잘생겨도 그렇지 얼굴만 찍으면 어떡해....
=
soojin remind me of selena gomez and idk why
=
"How gay did you want to make the fans?"


Moonbyul and Soojin: yes
=
Siapa yg kesini gara2 ada moonbyul 😍😍😍😍
=
Moonbyul 💜
=
Idk about you guys, but seeing Moonbyul's innocent smile at 10:24 just made me melt
=
마마무 응원봉 무임?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아 팬들 무 흔드는거 개귀엽넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
엠넷은 듣거라 이거 다들 개인직캠 풀면 대박난다. 난 너희에게 엄청난 아이디어를 준것이다. 돈 왕창 벌 기회를 주고 우리 팬들에게 이쁨 받을 수 있는 기회를 주겠다. 풀어라 당장. 우리 유아 봐야한다고!!!!!!!!!!! ㅠㅠ M2야 제발 광고 다 볼게!!! 너네만 보지 말고 직캠 좀 풀어줘!!! ㅠㅠ
=
I think yooa is my first girl crush 🤧💕 she nailed that smooth criminal performance 👀💗
=
2:21 soojin and whom ?
=
Imagine being a member of an underrated and forgotten girl group, then finally being able to perform on a stage again representing a huge senior and now she has to deal with telling Bom that she placed last. I feel so bad for her, how is this a competition if everybody gets a solo but her?! That's almost like making her the sacrificial lamb.
=
My personal ranking in this is

1. Loveyz
2. Oh My Girl
3. (G) I-dle
4. AOA
5. Mamamoo 
6. BOM
=
진짜 이쯤 되면 팬을 떠나서 유아가 그룹명 아이디어 잘 낸거 같다 다 다른 색깔들이 모여서 마지막에 파워출때 진짜 다들 멋있었으요.....
=
Yein and Soojin killed it!! 🔥
=
YOOA KILLED IT!!!
=
I love the performance of 1st girl ...so graceful hope she rank 1st
=
Eunji also should have her own performance 💔
=
엠넷아 퀸덤 끝나고 킹덤할 생각 하지 말고 퀸덤2를 해라 남자버전으로 하면 이정도 화제성이 나올까싶다.. 나올 여돌들 아직 많으니까 퀸덤2 ㄱㄱ
=
I wish I knew about Queendom when it was out - all the performances looked so strong and powerful and done by some incredible talented ladies 💪🏽🔥
=
the first girl was so smooth wth
=
YEIN DESERVE TO BE RANK1 🔥
She broke her Cute Ver. Dmn 🤧😒
=
watched this when it first came out and rewatched when i decided to stan mamamoo. best decision i ever made
=
Moonbyul and soojin “who got the power “ was the biggest p*ssy  energy in the century
=
08:34 to 08:40 yein. She was the best in the whole performance. Yooa was good too. I don't know who won this challenge but for me it's 1. Yein
2. YooA t
These two killed in the I got the power too. And eunji didn't get to dance at all. Mnet is so unfair. I was looking forward to eunji's dance.
=
아진짜 편집 왜이렇게했냐.. 유아 마이클잭슨 커버 진짜 잘했는데 모자로 얼굴까지 가리고 했는데도 얼굴 클로즈업해서 하반신 안무 다짤리고.. 직캠이 훨 나음 유아진짜잘했는데 ㅜ 아쉽네
=
Queendom should continue every year omg this must be a tradition!!!
=
Ohh.. my...goodlord...I think after Soojin's stage, every girls should reconsider their sexuality.
=
Soojin: *exists*
World: OMFG OMG OMG OMG AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA



Upd: mum, I'm famous....
=
The girl from Aoa, lovelyz, and Oh my girl were so good but unfortunately it's mainly a popular contest
=
Sojin is hyuna's second generation
=
Yooa!!!! ... I have no words, I'm not part of the fandom but I love Michael Jackson and this is my favorite song ever. When I saw her dancing I felt like a proud mother 💕

I really liked this girl... She is fire 🔥🔥🔥
=
Here for Soojin's dance perf. since i'm just starting to get to know more about G-IDLE,  watching as they perform Power and Strip by Little Mix, can't help but feel proud of my girls! ❤❤❤ #ForeverLittleMixer #StanGirlGroups
=
시대가 변하고 있음. 엠넷도 악편으로 논란 만드는게 아니라 서로 으쌰으쌰 하는 분위기로 영상 편집하는게 더 인기를 끌 수 있다는 걸 이번 기회에 절실히 깨달았으면
=
My heart flutter everytime i see moonbyul smile... 😍😍😍😍😍
=
수진이가 진짜 끼가 넘치다 못해 아주 그냥 다 흘리고 다니는구나....개 미쳤다
=
진짜 친절한 금자씨 뭐냐고 ㅠㅠㅠ 뭐냐고 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Everybody here is talking about Yein and Yooa so I'm gonna talk about mah baby Soojin. She was incredible and those facial expressions thooooo.💕
=
Male idol: *acts manly and sexy*

Moonbyul: I'm 'bout to end this man's whole career
=
Moonbyul doesn't care about rankings. She's here to collect more ladies for her growing harem.😂😂😂
=
7:46 아니 너무 방구석에 앉아서 보는 느낌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 왜캐웃기지 계속 마마무ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 사랑해ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
yooa was able to pull off all that with a stitched cut on her knees. no one was more deserving of that number one spot other than her.
=
But seriously moonbyul just won by performing the song she produced herself and then also singing in the song and dancing uniquely from the others she is truly amazing❤😁 she showed that a women can dance like this as well
=
개인적으로 예인의 처음무대 몰입도가 최고였음
=
Moonbyul❤
=
I've seen this so many times but every time you've got the power hits I have to fight my tears. Honestly one of the best things to happen in kpop.
=
I love all of Solars reactions be like Owo
=
SAVE MY LYFE PLS🔥🔥
=
If you love soojin cheorography like please

=
서수진 최고 ㅜㅠㅜㅠㅜ ❤️❤️❤️
=
I'M GAY FOR SOOJIN AND CHANMI OMG CONFRIMED
=
아니 그냥 유아 쎈 표정 지을때마다 너무 웃겨ㅋㅋㄱㅋ 삐진 체리마루ㅋㅋ
=
They really did MoonByul dirty with the camera work :( she deserves better.
=
정예인 이렇게 제대로 무용실력 보여준거 처음아님??.. 진짜 너므멋있다 그리고 유아할때 진심으로 소름돋음... 존멋...
=
YooA performance was the best! Michael Jackson is proud :)
=
I really wanna learn the choreo of power
 😍💖 it's 🔥🔥
=
Yein was done wrong
=
10:24 her smile omg
=
야 진짜 맨날 어정쩡 어제 태어난 연습생들 모아다가 별별 이상한 거 그만 시키고 이렇게 데뷔한 애들 좀 발굴해봐 아오 속답답하다가 진짜 미쳐벌이네 판 열어 주니까 이렇게 잘하는데
=
Idk who the first girl was but I hope she got the higher position. I love her dance!
=
Moonbyul is look like chicks magnet here🤭❤️🌹
How to be you..byulie!

정예인 대박이다 처음부타 딱 입 벌어지게 만드네 대단하다
=
list of my most favorites
1. yein
1. soojin
1. yooa
1. moonbyul
1. chanmi

BASICALLY, I LOVE ALL OF THEM
=
Moonbyul❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
1:08 That guy bumped his head on the floor. HAHAHA
=
Moonbyul “you’re the man!” hahaha
=
진짜 예인이 처음에 시작할때 너무 소름돋음 진짜.. 립싱크까지 딱맞고 무용하는 선도 너무 예뻐서 예인이가 제일 자기 춤선에 맞는 안무 짠거 같음... 어우 너무 잘했다 진짜.. 소름.. 너무 최고다..
=
Damn Soojin was so good.
=
10:19 meeee💀💀
=
5:50 you can see YooA's fingers, they are from nervousness I guess
=
10:23
=
다 잘하는데 이번에는 러블리즈 예인이 진짜 잘한거같음. 개인 무대도 단체 무대도 성실히 준비 잘 해온게 느껴짐. 특히 개인 무대 진짜 오프닝에 걸맞는 압도적 무대인거같음
=
MOONBYUL YAAAS
=
IM DO GAY FOR SOOJIN😭❤❤❤
=
Soojin's stage presence gonna kill me🔥
=
예인이 연습하면서 힘들어서 울었다고 하던데...4등 했을때 티 안나게 아쉬워하는게 다 보여서 너무 안타까웠음ㅠㅠㅠ 예인아 잘했어❤
=
Who like Yooa?👍
👇👇
=
유아 너무 귀엽구 파워풀 그자체 사랑해애애애ㅐ오ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ♡♡♡
=
Yein performance remind me of ten, they should collab
=
This is my favorite.... these are give me soooooooooo goosebump!
=
Yein slayedddd
=
퀸덤은 빨리 편집팀을 바꿔야함. 무대 중간에  리액션을 너무 과도하게 넣음. 10초에 한번씩 리액션을 넣으니 흐름이 끊기고 집중력이 떨어짐
=
damn, the first girl looks so elegant and gorgeous followed by a really sexy woman
=
별이언니 진짜 너무 멋있는거 아니냐고ㅠㅜㅜㅜ 미치겠다 진짜ㅠㅜㅜ언니 사랑해요💖💖💖💖
=
SOOOOOOJIIIIN, YOOAAAAA AND MOONBYUL GOT ME SCREAMING
=
9:28 why so handsome moonbyul? huhuhuhu
=
아니 한류 유명센거 알겠다고 알게쓰니까 제발 지짜 한국어로된 댓글좀 보자고 이 미친 감정을 표현해줄 한국인좀 제발 제발 제발..... ㅠ 자기들은 친절한 금자씨도 잘 모르자나아아아 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
I realy enjoy solar reaction
=
Moonbyul was really exceptional. I'm hands down ❤️
=
와 이건 진짜 미쳤어 여섯명 데뷔해라
=
Al ver a Soojin 
Se activo el * gay in panic* xd
=
여기 여섯 팀 팬은 아니지만 처음에 친철한 금자씨 예인님이 하는거보고 충격먹었다 예인님이 이번무대 찢으셨다.... 수진님 찬미님 유아님 문별님도 자신의 특성을 잘 살려내서 잘 표현하신 듯
=
I just watched it because of Moonbyul 😍 Ma' heart 😍
=
YOOA AND CHANMI CAN STEP ON ME
=
byul has that unique dance style with powerful and sharp moves that is extremely rare among girls she's special and very impressive
=
Solar's expressions are amazing af
=
다른그룹은 ㅋㅋㅋ 자기멤버나올때 응원해주는데 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 마마무는 문별나올때 왜 놀리냐고 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
SOOJIN!!!❤❤❤😭
=
Omg Good job Yein
Omg Moonbyul killed me with her dance
=
하 제발 수진이 진짜.. 미친 거가타 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Where is the appreciation of talanted Chanmi? 💕
=
유아 진짜 아이돌이 얼굴을 가리고 퍼포먼스 한다는게 진짜 춤에대한 자부심이랑 자신감이 엄청나구나 하긴 저래 추면 할말없지 멋있다 진짜
=
and yeah thinking that chanmi and yooa got an injury weeks before this...it just amazes me how great they really are
=
Moonbyul had the hardest moves and the best presence
=
My top 3 is Yein YooA Soojin.
Yein did really good. She deserves more.
=
정예인 4위?? 도랏나 진짜 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
THE FIRST GIRL, I'M SORRY I HAVE NEVER HAD LOVE IN THE FIRST SIGHT BEFORE, BUT HER..
=
Such a amazing performance!!!!!!!!  Even I don't know who they are, I can't breathe watching this.
=
OMG Moonbyuls smile at 10:24 made me blush, she’s handsome 🥰😂☺️
=
Moonbyuuul The Star ❤
=
All are talented, congratulations girls! 👏👏👏👏🔥💗
=
진짜..찬미 너무 잘하는데 왜 댓글이 많이 없냐 찬미 표정 진짜 ㄷㄷ..개쩔음 넘멋잇음 언니 날가져 완전 파워풀ㅠ점프하고 고개들때 내심장 바깥구경했어 언니
=
the difference with lovelyz reacting to their own member yein’s performance versus the other groups hyping their members
=
객관적으로 예인이가 1~2등할법한데 왜 4등했는지 아직도 모르겠음ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 문별도 잘하긴했는데 2등할정도는 아니라고 생각함 아무래도 맘무가 보컬위주니까 4~5등해도 다 그러려니 할텐데...
=
There are
 dancers who are remembered for theirs skills and some for dancing with their soul. I applaud companies who promote their idols as an art, not their dance as art.
=
02:27 수진 퍼포먼스에
02:31 언짢은 슈화

02:52 수진 따라하는
02:55 슈화
=
다른 그룹들은 "오구오구 내새끼 최고야 잘했어~~"
이런 느낌인데 
마마무는 ' ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 이새끼 놀릴거리 한개 생겼다  '
이런 느낌임 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Moonbyul T.T I wish you would be the one dancing MJ but u were amazing too I love you
=
my mixer heart is DYING
=
yooa is so so good omg
=
What I learn from this show, all the girl group have gay panic attack continuiously lmao
=
개인별로 한 건 예인이 좋았고 단체곡은 수진하고 찬미가 좋음 다들 너무 잘한당
=
What with Moonbyul being such an amazing rapper and writer, and MMM being known as a vocal group, people musta forgot just what a spectacular dancer she is. Soojin just oozes sex appeal and stage presence, and Chanmi is incredibly charming on stage. I am, however, mad that Yein got robbed - she should have been much higher.
YooA tho? Untouchable. There are maybe five or six "born idols" in the whole business; as in, you could see Tzuyu being a lawyer, but YooA could never have been anything else. And the love her members shower her with is just the sweetest thing ever.
=
They look like a new girl group! Hahahah cutie!!! MOONBYUL I LABBYUUU
=
breh these young korean girls needs more recognition for their talents 😭😭😭😭
=
2:32 슈화 쫀귀ㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅠ
=
예인대박 컨셉 소화 너무 잘 한듯 맨 첨에 뇌리에 팍 박혀서 다른 무대 보는 내내 여운 계속 남았음ㅠㅠ 저번 무대보고 편견 좀 갖었는데 취소취소!
=
승희 진짴ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 리액션 부자 같으니라곸ㅋㅋ♡
=
Yein and yooa deserves higher ranks imo
=
Chanmi did so well. I’m so proud!
=
5:53 유아 손떨어..ㅜㅠ 유아 힘내ㅜㅜㅠ
=
예인이 한편의 뮤지컬 보는것 같음
=
10:24 Moonbyul... u... u ugh... my heart ;_;
=
Oh my Moonbyul 😂
=
Moonbyul 😍 My beautiful and talented girl
=
8:54 chanmis eyebrow raise tho
=
seriously..Yein deserved better
=
문별 춤출때 백댄서랑 살짝 안맞는것같은데
=
이거 보면 자꾸 유아 보스베이비 같아ㅠㅠ
=
In my opinion (not based on how they normally dance, but on how much I enjoyed this particular performance)
1. Yooa
2. Yein
3. Soojin
4. Chanmi
5. Moonbyul
=
Solar's reactions are kinda cute lol
=
예인이 생각보다 춤 넘 잘 추네 시원시원하게 얘네 무대 대박임 ;;;
=
Yooah's talent is np joke.  Nice choreo by the way ☺️
=
I see Strip and Power, I clicked. Little Mix need to see this 😍
=
Bom should make Minzy do the dance T_T
=
I liked yooa's performance the best
=
Yein is truly so elegant...her moves are delicate and her dance mesmerizing. I keep watching the performance over and over again.
=
9:27 
Song: you’re the man~ 
Moonbyul: *appears*
=
내기준 
파워 : 예인
동작,춤선 이쁨 : 수진
시원한동작 : 유아
=
예인이 진짜 잘했다 ㅠ.ㅠ
=
Yooa's performance was what really impressed me.. it is so easy to mess up MJ.. yet she really pulled it off
=
정예인 진짜 한평생을 저 무대를 위해 살아온 사람 같애... 친절한 금자씨를 보고 정확히 해석한 사람만이 출 수 있는 무대다
=
Moonbyul​ cute​ Smile​ ><
=
9:49 HEY CUTIEEE
=
I still love how this is just girls hyping up girls ♡
=
Dear Soojin, thankyou 😭❤️
=
보면서 느낀건 프듀시리즈나 타오디션 프로그램에서 본건 그냥 장기자랑수준이구나 느낌
=
아니 예인아... 이렇게 잘해놓고 팀 무대가 파~압.... 난 아이돌에 팬은 딱히 없지만 마마무랑 전소연 좋음ㅎㅎ 근데 춤은 진짜 1위다 크으으 왜 이분 3위안에 못든건가요 ㅜㅜ
=
Soojin's performance was so cool
=
"you're the man" *pans to moonbyul* HECK YEAH
=
마마무 리액션 귀여웤ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 7:45 가족끼리 오글거리는거 보는마냥ㅋㅋㅋ
=
YEIN'S dance is so beautiful and unique i dont get why she ranked 5 i hate that.
=
머리카락도 조종한다더니... 사실이었나 ㅜㅠㅠㅜ
=
아니 다 멋지고 다 잘하는데 거의 마지막에 슈화가 "나 눈물 날 뻔해"하는거 나만 귀여움????
=
When all of them was sexy and moonbyul was just awesome in masculine vibe i was like:

Bro i seriously want to be you
=
I am in love with the camera work
=
예인은 현대무용이라는 본인의 독보적인 장점을 잘 이용한듯 ㄷㄷ
=
이 와중에 우리 문별언니 중간에 웃는 거 너무 사랑스럽다 꺅 >< ㅜㅠㅠㅜㅠㅜㅜㅠ
=
5:59 여기 승희 너무 욱겨서 자꾸 돌려보게됨ㅋㅋㅌㅌㅌㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Yooa performance remind me of Hyoyeon from SNSD,, ugh good old time
=
these performances made question my sexuality
=
THE FIRST GIRL SHOULD JOIN HIT THE STAGEEEE
=
Somehow moonbyul's manage to overpower everyone else in the group performance. Her moves are so smooth and effortless. Eventho she's at the back, it's hard not to look at her move.
=
10:19 *me checking if my wig is still on my head cause I'm too broke to buy another one*
=
수진이 너무 이쁘다ㅜㅜ❤️
=
진짜 수진 너무 잘해 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
예인 참 표정연기를 잘 하네 몰랐던 인재 알고 가는 기분... 수진은 원래 잘하는 거 알았고 이번에도 잘 했는데 조명이 너무 쎄... 아쉽다 수진이 잘 안 보일 정도로 센 조명 도대체
=
Yein's fans here 👇❤
=
05:10 ㅋㅋㅋ러블리즈 미주  "너무멋있어 진짜멋있어 쩔어(살짝 당황후) 너무 좋아"ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 현실 리액션나옴ㅋㅋ
=
진짜 마마무 사랑해
=
Amidst a very hot group of girls,  the whole stage was weighed by the charming MAN Moonbyul. 6:09 That's why  "he" doesn't need to show off his body curves but still cool.  And  9:27 "You're the man" "he" appeared like a god. I fell for that coolness
=
솔직히 친절해보일까봐에서 너무 신선한 충격을 받아가지고 뒤에걸 잘 못봄...
=
Omg the first three performances is amazing 👏👏
=
1:49 난여기가 왜이렇게 웃기지 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 섹si섹si ~
=
서수진...ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 언니 저 죽어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
유시아 미쳣냐........... 진짜 박자감각 저게 뭐야 언니 사랑해 나 3살이야..
=
초반이라 부담감 있었을텐데 예인이 친절한 금자씨로 진짜 무대 휘어잡고  너무너무 잘해줬고, 찬미가 이렇게 춤을 잘추는줄 몰랐음.. 특유의 풀린듯한 눈이 너무 매력적임.. 활실히 짬밥이 있어서 그런지 표정도 너무 좋았음
=
yein’s stunts and floor work alone should’ve put her in top 3 why did she get such a low rank?
=
these queens performed 2 little mix songs ❤
=
1:13 okay, it’s official, I’d let her break my heart😔💕
=
I love Moonbyul, but how did she ranked 2? 
I barely remember her performance, and she didn't stand out on the group performance :/
=
예인이 춤선이랑 표정이랑 분위기 오졌네 잘한다 많이 연습했네 정도가 아니고  춤이 되게 자연스러움 군무때도 눈에 띄고 5명이 서로 이어지는 무대 분위기도 좋았고 뭣보다 이제 서로 즐기면서 하는것 같아 진짜 콘서트 보는줄
=
솔직히 이건 예인이다
=
its disappointing how the camera work didnt do any justice for moonbyul but my girl did amazing❤
=
Moonbyul 😍😭
=
I really couldnt stop looking at Lovelyz Ye In. Shes so hot!
=
오마이걸 미미가 문별이 부채 들고 춤 추는 거 보고 자객 같다고 했는데 영어 자막엔 'ninja'라고 돼있네요. 엠넷 측에서 올린 자막이라면 정말 어이가 없을 일이네요. 이시국에.....자객을 뜻하는 단어로는 'assassin'이 있습니다. assassin으로 수정하세요.
=
마마무 리액션은 레알 현실친구인데? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Watch the fancam of moonbyul and you'll know why she got 2nd. Her moves are sharp and strong, thats why she stood up among them
=
화사 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 집에서 잠옷입고 보는줄 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
왼 예인이 최소 2위감 아니냐?
=
개인적으로 친절한 금자씨가 진짜 신선한 충격이었다....
이번 만큼은 러블리즈 정예인이 1위 했으면 좋겠음
+ 그리고 귀엽고 사랑스러운 러블리즈의 이미지에서 걸크러쉬의 색다른 면도 보여주고 싶다던 생각을 딱 정예인이 해결해 준 듯... 다들 식스센스에서 실망했었는데 친절한 금자씨 보고 러블리즈 재평가 할 듯 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 대박
=
10:24 보고 폴인럽 했습니다 다들 봐주세요....아 언니...ㅠ
=
역시 갓수진 밖에 안보인다
=
10:23   I cant hold it
=
when the other group proud for her member... mammamo shy and cringe ,😂😂😂😂
=
이번에는 확실히 예인이 잘하긴했다 보는 내내 도입부 계속 생각남 자기한테 잘 맞고 어울리는게 뭔지 아는듯
=
10:07  예인 존예
=
I thought that that was Halla Suji in the first performance! But still amazing! Their lookalike 😊
=
The most unforgettable and most unique is the first one. This is the one I liked the most. However, I feel like it's lacking in facial expressions. The dance is evocative but I'm dying to look for a change in expressions as well. Especially on 0:25 onwards when the music becomes more fast-paced, I was hoping that her eyes on 0:51 and most especially at the end should show something more intense. I was envisioning a development from the beginning, middle(climax), and end which she showed through her movements but failed in her eyes or facial expressions as a whole. 

The one who danced Señorita gave the most satisfactory facial gestures and charisma. Michael Jackson's comes second in terms of stage presence.
=
8:36 Power Little Mix
=
Who did the greatest?

Yein-like
Soojin-like
Chanmi-like
Yooa-like
Moonbyul-like
Eunji-like
=
I FREAKING LOVE MOONBYUL~~[](ﾉ>ω<)ﾉ
=

=
별언니 진짜 너무 멋있어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
=
와 친절한금자씨ost 진짜 제일 선곡 잘하고 춤도 잘 춘듯 처음에 했는데도 가장 기억에 남음
=
Im very curious how they change their outfit very fast
=
Moonbyul at 10:25 😍 That smile
=
Omg I am gonna cry and happy
=
타팬 : 문별... 멋있네

무무 : 문별... 카메라는 왜 이렇게 찍은거야.. 별언니 잘 안보이자나
=
No one is talking about Chanmi. She literally snapped so hard this time, I'm so proud of her and AOA as a whole in this show. They really deserve to win this time. By the way, Yooa and Soojin snatching wigs like always.
=
유아 화난 체리같아서 넘 귀여움ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
정예인 진짜 예쁘다 ....
=
Can't  get enough of Soojin's dance.. (im the guy who almost lost himself seeing Soojin's dance)
=
IM SCREAMING AT HOW GAY SOOJINS DANCE WAS SGSTSYSHS
=
수진 끼 개오진다.. 표정도 엄청 잘 짓고, 춤 도 약간만 췄는데도 잘추는게 훤히 보임. 근데 단체 군무때는 카메라가 잘 안잡아주네;;
=
진짜 찬미 스트립보러 맨날 들어온다ㅋㄱㅋㅋㅋㄲㅋ
=
와 예인 나레이션 따라할 때부터 걍 대박..
=
1:46 대박ㄷㄷ 포스.. 수진은 항상 눈에 띄는 거 같음
=
와...진짜 파워 할때 흐르는 전율이 아직도 안잊혀짐...
=
왜캐 다 외국인 댓글이누 ㅠ 
진짜 너무 잘햇다 고생한만큼 결과나온듯 
은지 분량 기대햇는데 없어서 아쉽ㅋㅌ
예인은 기대안햇는데 첨에 너무 소름끼치게 찢어놔서 예인이 젤인상깊고,, 너무 춤을 다들 잘춰서 연말시상식에서 한번 더 보고싶네 진짜 잘햇어여 다들


*** 근데 제발 집중좀 해서 보게 리액션 적당히 좀 넣어여;; 너무 흐름이 끊겨서 짜증남
=
다들 넘 잘추신듯 근데 예인님 하위권 넘 아쉽 ㅠㅠ 근데 유아님 반전 댄스 알겠는뎈ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ귀여운 아기가 어른제스쳐 하는 느낌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ앜ㅋㅋㅋㅋ저만 그런가요..?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
여기서도 엠넷 발카 들어난다....
=
4:27 넘 익숙해서 찾아봤는데 서지수님이고 보던 웹드라마의 여주셨네요! 진짜 연기 잘하시는 것 같아요!!
=
I just don't get it why Yein rank 4th when obviously her performance was flawless.

My Ranking though
1. Yooa
2. YEIN (sorry Moonbyul)
3. Soojin
4. Moonbyul
5. Chanmi
6. Eunji

=
슈화 진짜 귀엽닼ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 나 눈무 나뽀네~~~~~ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
예인 진짜 독특하다
=
다시봐도 예인 임팩트 쩐다... 러블리즈 식센끝나고 싫었다가도 너무 욕먹어서 짠했는데..ㅠㅠ 케이도 잘했고 예인도 잘했으니 기죽지말고 나아가랏...!
=
유아진짜 존멋...소름 ㅠㅠ
=
아니근데 현대무용 진짜 ㅈㄴ 잘했는데

=
서수진 잘한다!!!!!!!
=
Sometimes I forgot how powerful Yein and Yooa are when it comes to dancing because of their groups’s concepts. 
WM and Woolim please let them do a sexier or girl crush concept from time to time 😭
=
진짜 마냥 청순여돌, 섹시여돌, 아니면 노래나 춤에 나머지 하나가 가린 여돌들의 진짜 모습, 진짜 실력을 알려주는 프로그램같아서 안뻔하고, 멋있다 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
YooA is definitely first. Dance technique+ Choreo+ Charisma, nailed it all!
Yein's was also beautifully done (and I'm a sucker for contemporary)
=
난 찬미랑 예인이가 베스트라고 생각함. 예인이가 시작을 너무 강렬하게 열어주고, 찬미는 미드에 나오는 여전사처럼 박력있고 춤에도 파워가 넘침. 강렬한 눈빛연기는 덤
=
(G) idle soojin woo😍❤❤❤
=
10:24 I died.
=
Yooa i love it....
=
와 레알 문별 예인 찬미 수진 유아 박봄 도와주신분 대박이시답..ㅣ
=
기대를 안하고 있어서 그런지 예인이 진짜 개인무대나 단체무대나 진짜 잘했고, 유아는 의상이 한몫했다. 거꾸로 수진은 단체에서 의상이 너무 백댄서랑 비슷해서 좀 묻힌 느낌.. 예인, 유아 진짜 멋졌음
=
유아 보스베이비 같다ㅜㅜㅠ멋있는데 너무 귀여워ㅠㅠㅜㅠㅜ
=
Everyone in the performance unit got their own style and unique charisma. Damn Yein is so gorgeous and yup thought she deserved a better rank. But everyone is uniquely good.

6:07 Moonbyul
8:37 -All of them-
=
park bom was like y'all played yourself thinking i was gonna dance
=
다시보니까 예인 진짜 쩐다...개인 마지막장면 진짜 여신이야..진짜 다들 개잘한다ㅠㅠㅠ 서수진 제일 좋아하는 사람으로서 표정은 역시 너무 좋았는데 의상이랑 춤이 너무 야해서 아쉬웠음.... 찬미도 역시 aoa 짬밥이 있어서 너무 잘함..
유아 문별도 진짜 멋있었음ㅠㅠ 많은 여돌이 섹시 컨셉 보다 이런컨셉 많이 해 줬으면 좋겠는 개인적인 바램ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
Moonbyul.. girl you make me crushin on you.
=
10:32
????: 저거 우리 엔딩포즈인데
=
세뇨리따.....레져마음에 불질렀다....🔥🔥🔥
=
10:23 문별 너무 잘생겼다
=
This should be on MAMA 2019
=
Soojin and yooa😍
=
My top 3 😙
Yein
Yooa
Soojin
=
유아가 제일 잘했다 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
소오름.....  아니 이렇게 잘하는 아이돌이 많은줄 처음 알았음
퀸덤짱 재미있어요~~♥♥♥
=
서수진 진짜.......... 장난없다 보는 내내 숨막힘 어떻게 사람한테 저런 끼가 나오지???????
=
수진미쳤따ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
나 왜 마지막에 다같이 하는거 보면서 눈물나냐ㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠ 
다들 흥했으면.... 제발...
=
우리 수진언니♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
=
난 진짜 그 누구의 팬도 아니었는데 퀸덤 보면서 수진한테 완전 빠짐 ㅠㅠㅠ 너무 짜릿해
=
정예인 뭔가 청순 큐티 라는 그룹 이미지에 갇혀 있어서 이런 류의 춤 잘 어울리는 줄 몰랐는데 그냥 날라다니네ㅠㅠ
=
They put on a show. Wow. They are all amazing dancers. It was cool to see Eunji of Brave Girls participate. I was surprised to see her. I was especially blown away by the solo performances by YooA and Soojin. 😍
=
4:39 Past Mimi with bangs time travelled to our present and joined the audience 😁
=
유아 이번무대 왜 이렇게 송중기 닯았냐 귀여워ㅜㅜ
=
Goshhhh SOOJIN with those expressions thooooooo
I have always been a fan of her facial expressions 💕
=
정예인이 제일 의외다.... 저런 애인지 처음 암.... 맨날 아츄~♡ 이런 노래 불러서 그런가  수진은 그룹 컨셉 때문에 알았고 유아도 알았고  정예인 개이쁘고 춤 개잘추네.... ㄷㄷ
=
How can I watch queendom with subs
=
3:30😂😂😂😂
=
Moonbyul😍
=
Yooa and Yein were the best
=
와 이번에 예인이 제대로 포텐 터진듯 진짜 그 배경음악이랑 춤선의 조화가... 대박임 걍 첫 시작도 진짜 소름돋고 어떻게 저 생각을 했지???
=
OMFG CHANMI RAISED HER BROW AT 8:54 HFHDJDKD
=
Is no one gonna talk about how they had the legend park bom from 2ne1 for like 2 seconds just to take of someone's jacket? Like um what?
=
찬미님...왜..5등이죠....너무잘했는데....스트립 처음에 개소름돋았는데ㅠㅠㅠ
=
i hope they really enjoy the moment without thinking about the competition .. They all amazing.. equally amazing ...
=
아..우리나라 아이돌들은 진짜 판깔아놓으니 다 엄청잘하는구나
=
8:48 요기 맨 오른쪽 분이 입고있는 옷
프듀48에서 장원ㅇ영이 side to side할때 입었던 옷 아닌가
=
6:10

무무들
=
9:20
=
YooA and Moonbyul ate this
=
경쟁프로그램이 아니라 그냥 여돌영업방송이자나...
=
아..문별느님 사랑해요ㅠㅠㅠ
=
Mamamoo seems so relaxed lol
=
soojin,, she always amazing
=
tag urself im that one fanboy at 9:49
10:19 jesus hes such a mood
=
나 진심 친절한 금자씨 대사 따라하는거 보고 개소름 .. ㅋㅋ 친절해 보일까봐 .......... 너무 임팩트 쩔었고;
=
서수진 ㅁㅊ.. 도랏네
=
Mamamoo is my ult but soojin and yein really did it for me this time
=
8:53 Omg chanmi stop that attitude or I'm being a fan !!!
=
i think they didnt tell moonbyul to wear sexy clothes like

"lets wear sexy theme clothes and dont tell moonbyul" lol im just kiddin hahha
=
솔직히 예인... 이렇게 잘할 줄은 몰랐음.. 식스센스의 여파때문인가 기대 안했는데 첫무대로 친절한 금자씨 임팩트가 정말 쎘고 무대도 그에 맞게 너무 잘했다 퀸덤으로 인해 이렇게 잘 몰랐던 멤버들의 매력을 알게되어서 좋음
=
한정적인 컨셉으로 보여져서 몰랐는데 진짜 다들 끼 많구나 서바이벌이 스트레스일 수도 있겠지만ㅠ 콘서트에서만 볼 수 있는 개인 무대들을 공중파로 볼 수 있다는것도 되게 좋은듯.
=
1:33
=
와.. 문별언니❤️ㅜㅜㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 예인이도 짱인데ㅜ??? 수진도ㅜ
아니 걍 이건 다들 짱...👍❤️❤️❤️
=
moonbyul DID THAT
=
THE WAY EVERYONE IS SO GAY FOR MISS SOOJIN..... SAME
=
Yein may have lost but she won in our hearts💞
=
Ive always knew that yooa issa good dancer but yooo this show really lets all of their talent shows. I think imma watch
=
They amazing!!!!!!
=
슈화 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 나눈무나뻔놰~~~~ 귀여워미친다,,
=
평소 과소평가 받던 아이돌들의 개개인의 역량을 확인할 수있던 무대였던것같음 멤버들 한명 한명이 얼마나 빛나고  아름답고 멋진지 이 무대를 보고 깨달았다...ㅠㅠㅠ그동안 실력이 없네 마네 했던 내 자신을 반성하게된다...ㅠㅠ
=
와씨;; 다 너무 멋있는데 유아 나올 때 소름 쫙 돋았다 마이클잭슨 노래에 춤 딱딱 추는데 와.. 할 말 잃음
=
8:00 한예슬인줄ㄷㄷ
=
유아님진짜춤꾼이다... 몇번을돌려보는지
예인님도 이번 퀸덤통해서 다시봤어요 진짜 다들 빛나는 재목들이에요
=
moonbyul dancing like a man made her more beautiful
=
다양한 장르의 춤을 소화하는 인재들이 저렇게나 많은데 여자아이돌 안무의 폭이 더 넓어졌으면 좋겠다
=
8:30이분 옷 프로듀스48때 장원영이 포지션평가할때 입지않았나
=
GIRLS. I LOVE GIRLS.
=
Yeinnn😍 golden magnae😘😘
=
WHY NOBODY TALKING ABOUT OUR  MAKNAE CHANMI TT????
SHE DID SO GREAT MAAN!!!❤❤
=
정예인 너무 잘한다 진짜... 친절한 금자씨를 안 봤음에도 불구하고 왠지 모를 섬뜩함이 느껴짐 춤 시작하기 전 나오는 나레이션이랑 너무너무 잘 어울려... 강점인 현대무용 살려서 개인무대도 잘했지만 단체에서도 눈에 띔 파워에서 보이는 건강한 느낌 너무 잘 살아있고 춤선도 가벼워서 하나도 안 지저분해보임... 나 오늘부터 정예인 처돌이 그거 한다...
=
다들 넘 잘하고 너무예쁘다 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
와~ 쩐다 쩐다 하면서 보다보니 마지막엔 승희 리액션만 기억남;
=
Honestly, Power almost made me cry
=
이멤버로 유닛 활동도 해줬으면 좋겠다ㅠㅠ
=
와 예인....처음 보고 소름돋음..친절한 금자씨 영화 진짜 조아하는데 어ㄸㅎ게 표현했으려나 하고 봣는데 기대 이상으로 너무 잘했음.....와....
=
아 수진 ㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠ수진숮숮수지ㅣ니사랑행
=
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING BUT TO SCREAM!!! TELL ME HOWNCAN I IDOLIZE THIS GIRLS?!😍💖💕
=
I’m so gay after watching this
=
수지니 짱이야...❤️
=
와 진짜 예인님이 저렇게 춤을 잘추시는지 오늘 처음 알았음 완전...와... 미쳤다..
찬미님도 와 컨셉 찰떡이시구요 표정 다 오메 입덕각
=
Little mix,power
=
갠적으로 오마이걸 유아
마이클잭슨 무대가 좋았음
Personal , i like idol oh my girl yua  . Perpomens
=
유아 대박....아 사랑해
=
im here for S O O J I N
=
진짜 러블리즈 팬이 아닌데도 이번에 본 무대 다 너무 멋있었는데 특히 러블리즈 예인 무대가 너무 인상깊었듬 ㅠㅠ 노래 선정이 진짜 신의 한수.. 표정, 눈빛, 박자에 맞춰서 포인트 주는거까지 자신에게 잘 맞는 옷을 너무 잘 표현한 것 같다 ㅠㅠ 보는데 진짜 이 갈고 제대로 준비한게 그대로 전달됨
보여주고싶어하던 새로운 느낌도 잘 와닿았고 여태까지 퀸덤에서 나온 예인 모습중에 제일 예뻐서 더 무대가 풍성하고 멋있었다 ㄹㅇ..
또보게 되네 진짜 머시썽
=
아 누가 유아 돌 때 조직 보스처럼 멋있을 거 예상하고 있었는데 막상 도니까 존나 멋있는 보스베이비같다고 한 다음부터 돌면 보스베이비밖에 생각이 안나...
=
왜 하필 수진 때 좀 발캠이냐ㅜ
=
진심 찬미 솔로 때 극강의 발캠....여러분 꼭 풀버전 보고 오세요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
10:25 존나잘생김
=
Who Agree That They Should perform this on MAMA2019
=
10:01 슈화  •᷄⌓•᷅
=
MOONBYULIEEEEEEEE I just died i think
=
섹시봐도감흥이없다이제 ㅅ뷰ㅠㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
yooa,yein,chanmi,soojin,moonbyul,eunji ♥
=
유아는 진짜 자기가 뭘 해야 잘하는지 제일 잘아는 것 같아
=
yein, chanmi, and moonbyul omg😳 (everyone was hella good but i think they were my favorites)
=
유아 왁킹 혼자 성공했는데 잘리고 개억울하다 ㅜㅜㅜ
=
I come here for my moonbyul oppa
=
퀸덤2 보고싶다 여자아이돌이 더 재밌음 남자아이돌은 모이면 항상  문제만 일으키더라
=
The fact that people are amazed by Yein and asking who she is shows that people are recognizing her talent without bias! She and Lovelyz aren't well-known internationally, but they are so talented!!
=
와 예인이만 기억에 남을정도 👍🏼👍🏼
=
Chanmi is such a hottie total bias wrecker xD
=
First girl looks like a wampire
=
마마무는 왜 창피해해?ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ개웃곀ㅋㅋㅋㅋ친구나 친언니 동생이 나간것마냥 창피해햌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
이번에 예인 대박... 이 정도면 식스센스 탈피 성공했다..
=
문별 사랑해요 ㅠㅠ
=
4:45 ???: 멋진 호두마루
=
i wish Minzy was Bom's representative...
=
공동1등 유아 예인
=
예인님 무대가 너무 좋았음... 표정연기도 너무 좋고 본인의 장점을 극대화할 수 있도록 현대무용을 선택했고 이야기처럼 풀어나간 것도!!.. 재능이 많이 알려졌음 좋겠음..... 식스퍼즐 모두 좋은 무대 꾸리느라 수고 많으셨어요ㅠㅠ❤❤❤
=
1:08 did the guy hit his head on the floor???
=
Can anyone tell me the results!?
=
찬미도 역대급으로 이쁜ㄷ뎅
=
moonbyul . i love you~ 😚😚😚😍 ehehehe
=
마마무는 왜케 집안 안방에서 보는거같냐ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ티비에 가족나온거 보는거같음ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Soojin 😍😍🔥
=
예인이가 순위를 좀 뒤에했었으면 4위는안했을듯.... 단체로할때도 잘했는데 ㅁㅊ;;
=
siapa yg balik lagi ke sini?
agak kecewa ama hasio rank nya yeein.
btw disini rambut yooa itam, tp di penampilan selanjutnya rambut yooa udh pirang pdhl syutingnya di hari yg sama kan?
=
아이들에 수진?  전소연 끼에 가려져 있어서 몰랐는데 여기서 보니 제일 눈에 띄네 표정이...ㄷㄷ 하구만 춤출때 하체 중심도 잘  잡고
=
와 찬미한테 어장관리당하다가 서수진이랑 불장난하고 문별이랑 연애하다가 유아한테 반해서 생명의 위협 겪은 후에 정예인이랑 나락까지 가고싶다
=
From everything I’ve seen this show is clearly rigged to give Mamamoo the upper hand. They also are probably the most popular group on the show so they have the most fans voting for them. No reason that dance performance should have ranked above forth
=
I really loved the first one and the second strippery one <3 best ones!
=
Ah Soojin.. para un poco, mi corazón es débil :3
=
예인 진짜 섹시한척 1도 안하고 진짜 섹시하고 멋잇었는데....등수진짜 뭐임..
=
서수진 표정 미쳤나 진짜 언니 제발 나 숨 못쉬어
=
3:40 용손 띠용
=
다들 춤 잘추세요ㅠㅠㅠ
저는 개인적으로 문별님 표정이 진짜...
좋더라구요
=
I saw 'Byul I can go
=
유아 화난체리같아 기여워~
=
finally yein shined through after being overshadowed in the collab stage with other talented modern/contemporary dancers! and anyone can guess that soojin and yein are the same age? yein is loud  off stage while soojin is shy, but on stage yein is graceful and soojin is confident 😂
=
승희 리액션비 따로 두둑이챙겨줘요ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
방금 결과 보고 왔는데 문별 2위ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ순위 의미 있냐? 당연히 최하위일줄
=
9.21 it's so crazy.
=
단체 시작 전에 얼굴 다 보여주는데 유아만 그림체 다른거 짱커엽네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 다들 근엄하게 막 카리스마 뿝뿜하게 서있는데 왜 유아만 언니따라 하는 동생 느낌나냐ㅠㅠㅠㅠ커엽
=
아 정예인 오프닝 친절한 금자씨부터 벌써 대박났다 식스퍼즐 너무 대박이야
=
2:40 이 둘 나는 찬성일세~~
=
Damn Soojin 😂😂
=
Mijoo makes my days
=
순위나 투표수를 떠나서 다 너무멋잇고잘햇고 잘 몰랏던 매력들을 많이 알게됫음 ㅜㅜ
=
유아는 진짜 어느 곡이든 자기 걸로 만들어 버리네 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
Soojin killed it💚💚this girl on fire 
I love hee so much 
Im a new fan 
Soojin
=
문별 춤못추는데?? 백댄서랑 박자도 안맞고
=
예인아 너가 일등이야
=
While everyone is so cutesy and sexy, moonbyul has all the swag 😁
=
아이돌들 못한다고 무시해도 연습생에서 승급해서 데뷔하는 애들은 다들 한따까리씩 해서 데뷔하는구나 하는걸 느꼈음 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
예인이 ㅁㅊ...
=
OMG!!!!! Soojin So Perfect
=
Moonbyul me enamora cada vez 💕😍
=
썸네일 두명만 동작 다르네
=
Queendom is the best thing in 2019
=
문별 짱 잘생겼다 진짜ㅋㅋㅋ
=
피치 퍼펙트 + 스텝업 느낌 나만 받았냐... 서로 장르 다른 댄서들 혹은 보컬들 모아서 역경과 고난을 거쳐 멋지게 공연에 성공하는 그런 스토리 다들 알자너...
=
여돌도 저렇게 다양한 걸 할 수 있는데 그걸 이런 프로그램을 통해야만 보여줄 수 있는게 넘 아쉽다ㅜ 
문별 너무 멋져ㅠㅠ
=
sOOJIN?! 😭
=
Soojin danced with a female dancer instead of a man made her solo 100 times hotter 🔥🔥
=
찬미 표정보소 08:53
지렸다 ㄷㄷㄷ
=
Moobyul is the best ❤
=
The top 3 shud be yein, yooa & soojin
=
퀸덤끝나면 진짜 제발 다시한번 여돌들로 시즌 2만들어주기류ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
아무리 커리어가 낮아도 걸그룹 데뷔한애들은 확실히 다르네
프듀에서 잘한다고하는애들하고도 
완전히 급이 다름
=
혜정 리액션 왜케 옆집 언니같냨ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I STAN OMG FROM NOW :)
=
유아보려고 계속봄  . . 너무 멋있다
=
와..근데 유이는 진짜 멋있다..
수진이도 진짜 너무 잘했고
예인이는 와 진짜 예쁘고 진짜
다 잘했는데 유이는 진짜 대박
=
Yein, Soojin et Chanmi were HOT AF
=
정예인...미쳤다 진짜...이건 진짜 그냥 예술작품이잖아?? 원래 무용전공자인건 알았지만 정말 댓글을 달 수 밖에 없게 만드네...대체 몇 번을 돌려본건지...정예인 씨, 좋은 작품 감사합니다...^^
응???? 1위가 아니라고? 왜? 아, 문별...마마무 중에 문별이 최애긴한데...아 그렇구나...ㅋ
=
다 잘했다 진심💖







화사 문별 볼 때 나혼자 산다 찍는거 같닼ㅋㅋㅋ맘무들 집에서 보는거같은 편안함ㅋㅋㅋ진짜 긔여워ㅠㅜㅜ💟
=
문별춤그닥잘춘게아닌데
팬덤빨인가
=
The first girl a.k.a yein should deserve better
=
개인적으로 정예인 유아 수진이 찢었다고 생각함 물론 다 잘했지만
=
Imagine if Bom chose Minzy to represent her 😍 its the end of this performance 🙌🏻
=
유아 졸귀엽네
=
개인적으로 찬미무대 되게 멋있는뎁
=
예인 욕나오게 멋있네...씨바
=
이쯤되면 경쟁 서바이벌물이라기보다는 합동 콘서트같은데요 순위매기는 의미가 없음ㅋㅋ
=
정예인님 앞에 인트로 미쳤다...
=
Hehehe, I was smiling the whole time while my girlfriend is right beside me. 
She definitely understands how I feel, cuz she was the one that's fangirling the most.
Ahhh, all of them are so talented!
=
they’re soooooo amazing, each and everyone one of them shines in their own colours
=
Yein chanmi 😍😍😍😍✨✨✨
=
다 잘했는데 개인적으로 예인이랑 유아가 진짜 잘한 것 같음ㅠㅠ 예인은 표정연기랑 춤선이 미쳤고 유아는 고냥 멋있다는 말밖에 안나옴ㅠㅠ역시 걸그룹 메인댄서들은 다른 것같음
=
야망 체리마루
=
예인 도입부 미쳤고, 수진이 세뇨리따에 언니 그냥 반했고, 유아 마이클잭슨 춤에 나도 춤이라는걸 춰보고 싶어졌다.. 수진아, 표정이 어쩜 그래ㅠㅠ? 니 표정에 언니 게속 허우적댄다ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I juz wish that the part that they dsnce to 《power》together can be longer
=
다들 너무 잘했다

그런데 솔직히 마이클잭슨은 너무 치트키 아니냐 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
케이팝 아이돌 실력이 이 정도야,,,, 진짜 잘한다 잘해.. 무대를 찢어놓는다!!! 연말 시상식에서도 퀸덤 무대해줘 연말 무대 찢어놓을테니... 안하면 엠넷바보다 바보야
=
The gays win this one boys🤤
=
4:45 야망넘치는 체리마루
=
1. 유아
2. 수진
3. 예인
=
I was sceptical of Moonbyul saying she was the main dancer of Mamamoo before watching this. Anyone who says she isn't that good of a dancer NEEDS to watch this. She was really good and showed what she can do. She doesn't get chance to do something like this with Mamamoo so it seemed like she wasn't that good but she is an amazing breakdancer.
=
난 오로지 서수진밖에 안보인다 이번에 예인언니도 정말 잘했고 그냥 식스퍼즐 진짜 대단하다고 생각했고 정말 기억에 평생남을만한 무대... 아 진짜 보는내내 내가 마치 닭이 된 느낌이었음ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
와 유아 개멋져 진짜
=
Soojin FTW !! 💓
=
Yein
=
예인 유아 찬미 미쳤다
=
예인이 진짜 찢었네. 팔다리가 길어서 춤선이 더 돋보임. 그리고 문별은 베르사유의 장미 오스칼 같음
=
This is a lejendary performance
=
YEIN AH
=
유아언니 ㅠㅠ 뭔 모자를 써도 찰떡이에요 ㅠㅠ 걍 언니꺼 ㅠㅠ 심지어 저 반짝이 ★빨간★ 바지도 개 잘어울리는건 뭐여 ㅠㅠ 엉니 살랑해 ㅠㅠ
=
진짜 다시봐도 엠넷 카메라워크 명치 세게 때리고싶다
=
원래 첫번째 차례가 제일 안 좋은 점이 뒷 차례로 점점 가면서 묻힐 수가 있음
정예인은 첫번째인데도 끝까지 기억에 남음.... 걍 대박임 선이 너무 예쁨
=
Soojin is so damn sexy.. I'm being a lesbian right now😂
=
멜론어워드같은데 또 나와서 무대해줬으면 좋겠다 ㅜㅠ
=
아니 자꾸 러블리즈 예인님 보러 자꾸 오게 되요🙊🙊🙊
=
for me, in group performance, soojin is the best..she has vibe in her dance.
=
예인이 무대 계속 돌려보게되네 개쩐다 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Chanmi😘😍😍
=
진짜 섹시하게 나온다 조명도 그렇고 흰 셔츠에 짧은 바지, 빨간 립스틱까지.. 넘 이뻐
=
This is so unfair rn.Brave girls eunji didn't even had a solo performance
=
Soojin killed it 💜💜
=
정예인 수진은 진짜
 미쳤다
=
03:21?
=
8:54 눈썹 들썩이는 왼쪽분 누구예요 하씨 반해버리겠네 +유아 귀여운데 졸라잘한다
=
나 이 프로그램 너무 좋아
=
이렇게 데뷔해도 될듯
=
That's is how the main dancers are, their talents need to be given out. It's such a waste on talents; thank u Mnet for giving them the opportunities to be THEMSELVES.
=
다 모여 춤 출 때 유아만 박자감이랑 디테일 쩌는데 잘 안드러나서 넘 아쉽지만 1등 헿
=
친절한 금자씨 무대 정예인 혼자 한거죠. 초장부터 레전드를 찍어버리네.. ㅠㅠ
=
다른사람이 1등하면 그것에 박수를 쳐줘야지 에궁 팬들 수준하고는
=
유아가 찢었다
=
러블리즈 퍼포 유닛으로 예인이 보낸 건 참 잘한 거 같다,,,,그 망작 조금이나마 잊게 됨 예인 너무 잘했어ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
I love chanmi😍
=
Yooa is on beat in Power if you press speed 0.5 you will see!!!!
=
Moonbyul is so handsome omg
=
유아 4:30
=
예인아 인간이 어떻게 저렇게 아름답게 움직여
=
춤에서 온(on)비트 / 오프(off)비트라고 있는데
온비트가 박자가 맞는것
오프비트는 박자가 미세하게 빗나가는 것
이라고 보면 됨
더 디테일하게는
비트에서 쿵짝!이 있다면
여기서 짝을 더 쪼개서 디테일하게 들어감
그러면 짝!이라는 것이 쪼개져서 짜-악!인데
*짜에 맞추는건 오프비트
*악!에 맞추는게 온비트임
그래서 온비트인 사람이 언듯보면 박자가 느린것처럼 보이지만 음악이랑 같이 자세히보면
제일 잘 맞는거임.
춤출때 이거 생각안하고 추면 춤을 급하게 추는 것처럼 보임.
그래서 유아가 최고라고하는거임.
참고로 원래 유아팬 아니지만 이번 춤 디테일에서 감탄했음.
=
Byul-yi’s performance is so underrated 🥺
=
수진이 오지네
=
서수진 춤 개잘춘다.... 3위햇지만 내맘속엔 1등
=
정예인이 현대무용으로 발라버리고
서수진이 섹시 춤으로 발라버리고
김찬미가 춤으로 발라버리고
유시아가 발재간으로 발라버리고
문별이 부채로 발라버리고 진짜 나 죽어..,
=
으아니 마지막 싸비에 우리 찬미티티 센터였는데 원샷 한번을 안 잡아준 것 실화인가요?
=
찬미 표정 춤 다 쩐다
=
프로듀스 101이였다면 아이돌스 인가
=
wbk they were powerful but this... its just amazing
=
찬미는 왜 말이 없지 찬미 보고 좀 소름돋았는뎅..이렇게 춤 추는거 첨봐
=
아 유아..처음엔얼굴땜에 좋아했는데 미쳤네요
=
Moonbyul ah😍💜
=
when I'm told to be a lady: 2:55 

/attention to Shuhua/
=
why is chanmi’s performance so underrated it she killed it
=
I heard that Yein cried while preparing the performance bcs she thought she wasn't good enough since she was replacing mijoo (the main dancer) but girl YOU SLAYED🔥 and you're really talented.
=
woah soojin’s performance.... she didnt come to play around...
=
중간에 자막 뭐야 ;
=
직캠 보고왔는데 진짜 발캠이구나... 으윽....
=
여기 조회수 비중 중에 예인이 반은 차지할듯 ㅜ... 직캠으로 성이 안차서 맨날 이거보러 오는중
=
개인적으로 예인을 첫타자로 한 게 넘 신의한수였던것같음.. 진짜 개소름돋았다..
=
yooa and moonbyul ate this performance
=
the girl from lovelyz... deserve a better position, when I saw her dance moves i was wooo mesmerized ! Soojin was woo her dance was so sensual, and it's funny how different is once she's on stage, so powerful !
Chanmi did a good job but I think she needed to do more moves, she relied big part in her dancers but she needs to be the star ! Yooa was so nervous because she really wanted to do it perfect, you can clearly notice how nervous she was once you see her fingers (left hand) at the end of her performance. She totally deserved 1st, her dance moves wooo such a talented girl ! Moonbyul wooo strong movements ! what a performance !
It's a shame that the girl who was working with Park couldn't have this oportunity to perform alone, that would have been awesome !
=
단체 춤 추기전에 찬미 눈썹 한쪽 올리는 거 대박이라고...ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 찬미얘기 왜 아무도 업썽 ㅠㅠㅠㅠ진짜 너무 멋있어 언니 날 가져아아아앙앜카앜키ㅏ커니맣ㅇ니ㅏ허나ㅣㅎ
=
Só orgulho kkkk amei essa apresentação da dança...
=
개인 무대에서 제일 강렬하게 기억에 남는건 서수진하고 유아인것같다... 서수진은 무슨 무대할때마다 얼굴 표정이 바뀌고 몸짓도 바뀌는게 매일봐도 신기함... 그리고 유아는 마피아 두목 느낌나서 진짜 간지작살남....오마이걸에서 못봤던 모습을 본것같아서 신선했음..
=
시즌2 남돌하면 대박날 것 같긴한데 팬들끼리 순위싸움에 ㄹㅇ피터질것같음..
=
마마무는 거실에서 옹기종기 앉아서 가요대제전 보는 느낌이네
=
yooa’s performance got me speechless omg she did so wellll
=
유아는 진짜 개잘하네;;
=
THE CAMERA FOCUSING ON MOONBYUL WHEN IT SAYS “YOU’RE THE MAN”
=
2 little mix songs❤😍
=
저는 엄마랑 같이봤는데 너무 선정적이라고 하네요 그래서 중간에 채널 돌리셨어요ㅠㅠ
=
9:48 - 10:19   this guy is like , now i dont want anything else in the world now . I'll die happily 😂😂😂😂😂
=
친절한 금자씨 무대 정말 좋았어요b
=
와 예인 처음 나올때 대사랑 표정에 뒷목 잡고 노래랑 퍼포 시작하자 마자 심장 멎음 ㅠ. ㅠㅡ웅구ㅜ유 ㅠ. 이정도였나 싶고 퀸덤 무대가 진짜 좋은 자리라 생각한다 ..
물론 엠넷한테 고마운 건 아님
=
8:50
=
댄스만 보면 aoa 멤버가 가장 잘하네 표정 힘 춤선 독보적임 개인 무대는 예인이가 잘했고
=
수진이 너무잘했다.. 1등이나 2등은 할줄알았는데 ㅠㅠ 쨌든 수진언니가 다잡아먹었어 끼던 춤선이던 나한텐 당신이 최고야 서수진 ㅠㅠㅠ하
=
okay i need to know the name of the girl who danced to smooth criminal
=
친절한 금자씨 예인이 장난 아니네 ㅠㅠ
=
They all be wearing sexy outfits and there is Moonbyul---
=
Ladies and gents may I introduce the FEMALE SUPER M
=
1. yooa 2. yein 3. moonbyul
=
4:30
=
브레이브걸스 은지를 너무 개인파트도 안주고 카메라도 안잡아주면 얘가 당연히 자기 끼를 발산하지도 못하는데 무슨 순위를 매긴다는거야;;;
=
Who spotted Hyunseung from Aura on the left during Dtrip performance? Sunmi dancers ❤😁
=
The choreography to Strip by Little Mix was amazing 😍
=
SOOJIN DAAAMNN
=
예인이가 왜 4위냐고ㅋㅋㅋㅋ퀸덤 통틀어 제일 어이 없던 순위다 ㅋ
=
YooA as always so underrated and is one of the best dancers out there. I love that she gave the performance a different flavor, not the typical choreo for a female idol dancer. It was cool 
I loved Chanmi part a lot actually, it was sexy but powerful, perfect girl crush 
Yein was the revelation of this performance, she was so graceful. I'm glad she was chosen to open the performance. I hope this help to dissolve the hate Lovelyz received from that last performance
=
What's the ending sign
=
Soojin 😍
=
2:40 song?
=
예인도 순위가 아쉽지만 찬미도 정말 아쉽다고 생각함 ... 어떻게 저게 5위지 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
와 러블리즈 탈락했으면 친절한 금자씨 못볼뻔한거잖아...
=
Can somebody maybe explain why there are covering a few members from different groups an Little mix song😊? I wanna know xd
=
좀 뜬금포긴 한데 친절한 금자씨 인트로 목소리 라미란님 같음
=
와 미쳤다....좋아요 백개누르고 싶다
=
When soojin and moonbyul said yes for the gays
=
정예인이 시작을 엄청 잘 끊은거 같다 진짜 임팩트있게 잘했음
=
moonbyul and soojin though DAMN
=
잘했어 내새끼 진짜 개웃기네 승희 볼때마다 충청도에 있는 고향 할머니 같아
=
tag urself im the guy at 10:19
=
Wow YooA :O
=
퍼포먼스적으로는 예인이가 가장 잘한 것 같은데 유아 춤선이 너무 압도적이다... 표정은 수진이 대박.
=
My wig has been SNATCHED!!!!!!
=
예인 이렇게 예뻤나 ... 너무너무 예쁘다 개인적으로 춤도 제일 잘 춘 것 같음
=
The first girl who is she
=
who are they. why am i in love sis?
=
와 예인이 진짜 미쳤다....럽리멤버중에 저런 인재가 있었다니 ㅠㅠㅠ 식스센스로 저평가 받은거 너무 아쉽다 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 꽃길만 걷자
=
SEO SOOJIN MAKES ME A LESBIAN, BECAUSE OF HER PERFORMANCE!! 🤩🤩😍😍😍
=
남자친구씨박성수씨일찍일어나요사랑해요
=
야망 체리마루여왕님🍒
=
Chanmi😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
=
수진은 어떻게 저렇게 무대 밖이랑 무대 위가 다르냐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 너무 멋있어
=
ㅁㅊ내가뭘ㄷ본거지...나왜퀸덤하나도안봤지..나진짜대가리붙잡음...진짜미쳐^다...
=
YooA😍😍😍😍
=
수진 사랑해
=
Can someone tell me the other two girls? I recognize GIDLE Mamamoo Oh My Girl and AOA but who are the other two girls?
=
난 정예인이 저렇게 춤선이 좋은 줄 몰랐음..ㅠㅠ
=
Did someone know from were can I find Yooa's red shorts?
=
Look at the moonbyul🤩😱
=
I'm so proud of how my Moonbyul shines. Like omg ❤️ the handsome charisma she possesses 😍😍😍
=
언니들...절 가져요
=
예인: 소름돋을 정도로 좋았던무대
수진: 섹시한걸 본인도 아는 무대
찬미: 파워풀한 힘을 모두 보여준 무대
유아: 보스베이비임 멋지고 귀여운거 다함
문별: 부채로 강력한인상남김
은지: 개별무대가 없어서 아쉬웠음
팀무대는 너무좋았고 나는 또 이영상을 5번째보는중이지
=
박봄은 왜 대타 쓴거예영?
=
가끔 여자들이 남자가수 퍼포먼스하면 느끼(?)할때 있는데 유아 진짜 다시봤다, 이렇게나 잘하는 아이돌이었구나
=
Cover your eyes! (Does not cover)
=
난 다 누군지 모르겠구 문별 최고였다
=
예인 퍼포먼스 친절한 금자씨 대사로 시작하는 것도 소름인데 마지막에 목에 힘들어가는거랑 바람 부는 것도 개소름.,,,,ㅠㅡㅠㅡㅠㅡㅠ
=
은지는 누구에요????
=
진짜 다 잘해서 누가 젤 잘했다고 말을 못하겠음 솔직히, 마지막은 유아가 최고고 개인공연은 진짜 다 잘함 진짜
=
9:12
=
HILANG SUDAH KEWARASANKU
=
처음 예인이 대사 따라할 때 진짜 소름돋음
=
5명이 각자 개인무대를 하고 6명이 함께 한노래를 잘 맞추어서 하는것이 쉬운일이 아니고 각자 콘셉트도 다를텐데 이렇게나 잘 어울려진다는게 너무 좋은것 같다 진짜 엠넷 남자편말고 여자편으로 한번 더해
=
I wouldn't mind if they Debut Six Puzzles as a temporary Girl Group. I mean, these girls got so much potential working together as a group <3
=
Moonbyul is such a queen 💓💓💜💜😍😍
=
yooa is such a good dancer, and her outfit? lord jesus in heaven
my wig is wheezing
=
SOOJIN IS SO DIFFERENT FROM LAST EPISODE LIKE WHAT THE HECK IS HAPPEND TO HER❣
=
The Chanmi girl stole the show with her confidence. The confidence and vibe she exudes is amazing. The camera and editing did her no justice, when it was her center part at the end the camera didn't even do a close-up. Her presence on stage is really amazing.
=
THE FACT THEY DIDNT PUT SOOJINS 🤨 AT THE END IS A CRIME
=
유아 솔로무대 끝날 때 손 떨리는거 보고 내가 다 떨렸네...
=
2:33
=
와 미친 이 감정을 설명해줄 한국인이 필요해
=
10:19 the boy is holding his hair because it will fly because of the power combined
=
Soojin 😍 moobyul 😩😩😩😩😍😍😍😍🤤🤤🤤
=
8:24
=
Let me ask a question
*AM I A GAY?*
=
내 취향 개인무대에서는 예인 찬미가 표정연기나 춤선 힘 같은 면에서 눈에 띄었고 단체에서는 왜케 수진이가 눈에 띄는지!! 다들 정말 멋있었음~!~!
=
Can we just compare chanmi dancing to strip and chanmi singing and dancing to jelly
=
순위가 좀 아쉽다.. 문별이 2등은 아니라고봄 개인은 잘했는데 단체안무에서 많이 아쉬웠음 예인 순위 충격적
=
Moonbyullll😍😍😍😍😍
=
이런거보면 일본akb는 유치원 재롱잔치
=
암만 은지가 박봄 분신으로 나왔다고 해도 그렇지 단독 댄스 분량은 좀 줘야하는거 아니냐 투표 불리하게 넘하네
=
8:47
=
아니 다 댄스포지션이라서 어디에 눈을 둬야할지 모르겠네 ㅠㅠ 다잘해 미쳤어 ㅠㅠ
=
마지막곡때도 브브걸 은지님은... 카메라 잡아주지도 않네 ㄷㄷ
=
수진아 이쁘다
=
진짜 유닛경연은 순위의미가 없을정도로 다 잘했다 
점수도 크지 않고 누가1등해도
누가6위해도 안이상하니 쓸데없이 안싸웠으면 좋겠네
=
I wish WheeIn was feeling better. She’s the powerful dancer of Mamamoo. I love Moonbyul but i think her style is more relaxed with small details. While WheeIn’s style wouldve fit this scenario more. Tbh any of the four couldve been the dancer
=
im here because of strip and power by little mix ahehehe
=
CHANMI GOT 5TH PLACE???
😥😥 MY BABY DESERVES BETTER!!!
=
수진할때 aoa멤버들 반응 나만 웃기나  언니들의  아재반응 오예아~ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Soojin is like a cat offstage and then turn into tiger when onstage 🔥
=
난 파워 이거 혜윤이 부르는게 좋았다 바로 떠올르네
=
SOOJIN MA QUEEN!
=
8:38
=
The first one is the best  I think
=
My Rank :
1. Soojin, YooA, Yein, Moonbyul, Chanmi, Eunji
2-
3-
4-
5-
6-
=
3:32
=
who's a mixer here?
=
Moonbyul was so hot, she killed it
=
수진밖에 안보임 |~~~~~~
=
서수진 진짜 뭐야????? 표정 뭐야???? 그냥 눈빛이 내 맘을 때려부수고 있네 미쳤어 미쳤어!!!!
=
유아보스베이비같아
=
발라드가 웬말이냐 갑자기 거기서..?
=
*Eunji, Bom's substitute didn't even get a solo....what is this??*
Mnet This is not fair at all..ofc she would be ranked last coz she didn't have a solo.
I'm just confused as to why people are not talking much about this!!
Im soo mad
=
for those not aware, the girl who did michael jackson (yooa) danced all through that performances with a cut on her knee that needs stitching! imagine how painful that must've been given the choreos. 😭
=
예인 팬은 아니였는데
이번에 예인 무대가 제일 기억에 남는다 ㅠㅠ
=
야망있는 체리마루..
=
와 대박 언니들 학학 왜 이제 봤지 이걸
=
왜 이렇게 눈만 시뻘겋게 칠하고 다녀?
친절해 보일까봐... 여기서 부터 소름이 좌아악~
=
4:30
=
Wow Soojin was literally born for the stage. Her charisma is insane
=
I keep coming back to the video. This season was LEGENDARY. Queens every single one of them. I can only hope any subsequent seasons will be as good. My only complaint would be the voting system and i hope they fix it if they proceed with this show concept. Fingers crossed for more though! Seeing these artists doing these things their way is so refreshing compared to these over produced tracks being pumped out.
=
이제 유아 저 착장만 보면 야먕체리가 머리에서 떠나질않아
=
무대는 AOA 여기서는 예인이 갑
=
Hope have season 2
=
나는 문별이 이렇게 춤을 잘 추는 지 몰랐는데 춤선이며 스타일이며 내 취향임
=
1위하고 4위랑 겨우 204점 차이나더만 순위상관없이 예인 잘하는거 다들 인정하니 그만좀 헀으면 좋겠네
=
I wanted to ask if Park Bom is okay? Is she alright?
=
I'm being gay for moonbyul. Oh no
=
Chanmi looks like poison ivy omg
=
Other groups: so proud of their member solo performance. 
mamamoo: laughing.. being shy.. during moonbyul's performance 🤣🤣🤣

Edited: Just wanna add welcome back wheein! Why so pretty 😍
=
she did THAT
=
Moonbyul perf was so boring🙄
=
유아 얼굴 작아서 모자가 해변모자 같은디
=
Solar's facial expression to every performance is really priceless 😂😂😂
=
와 개인무대 진심 다 소름돋음.. 다 잘해..미쳤어진짜 특히 정예인 재발견이다 저렇게 잘하는애한테 여태 이쁜척 귀여운척만 시키고 진짜 재능낭비다.. 찬미도 저렇게 파워있게 춤 잘추는줄 처음 알았네
=
식스퍼즐이 이걸로 마지막이라니 저 울어요
=
Came here again because 'they' said my YooA's tempo is late, but actually her tempo is the most accurate with the beat lol.

After that they praise YooA, yea man that's what you should do to the Queen
=
The first girl is the best here but she is not famous
=
아니 다 잘했는데 별이언니 은근 까내리고들 난리야ㅠㅜ
물론 마마무가 이중 팬덤이 가장 크지만 마마무도 실력으로 그만큼의 팬덤들을 쌓아왔고 팬들은 소통을 열심히하고 모르는 무무들을 위해 무무들 사이에서도 홍보도 함
그래서 마마무가 표가 많이 나오는건 맞는거임... 솔직히 그 부분에서 불공평하지만 그렇다고 마마무는 팬덤빨이라고 욕하는거도 팬이지만~ 이러면서 팬코하면서까지 마마무 돌려까고 진짜 열심히 무대준비 한 멤버들도 팬들도 마음아파요ㅠ 아무리 성에 안차도 욕하는건 하지마라고요ㅠ 다 잘했다고 수고했다고 칭찬해줘요
=
와 정예인 춤선 너무 곱다 아름답다는 말은 이럴때 쓰는거구나 ... 진짜 너무 예뻐ㅠㅜ
=
1:49
=
The Micheal Jackson girl slayed
=
문별 멤버들 사이에선 이뿐데...
그리고 단체 안무에서 반 박자 차이나네
신기하게 유아만 다름
=
Isn’t it the last part of the dance from itzy dalla dalla?
=
아니 마마무는 거실에서 같이 티비보는것같다고 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
이걸 꼭 순위를 줘야 되는 거임?? 나는 다 1위 줄래 ㅠ
=
미쳤다 미친 뭐야 처음에 나온 붉은 치마 입은 언니 누구에요 소름 쫙 돋았어 언니 이름이 뭐에요 언니 이름을 앓다가 죽고십ㄱ어ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
Moonbyul oppa...
=
ANNIE ARE YOU OKAY?
=
YEIN YEIN YEIN YEIN YEIN YEIN YEIN YEIN YEIN YEIN
=
유아 페도라.. 얼굴이 다들어가겠네..
=
Solar reaction ❤😘😍😍😍😍
=
chanmi is really misstreated, 5th place and the camera didnt shoot her eventhough she is in the center😕
=
Moonbyul and soojin will forever be iconic
=
굳이 프듀랑 비교하긴싫지만 프듀보다가 이거보니까 얘네가 현역이라그런지 급이다르네.
=
The guy the camera keeps turning to is a total mood
=
Yein is dancing just like a soft floral in the wind. So dreamy yet so attractive. I had a really high hope that she will rank 1st but well I’m so disappointed 😔. She killed it with her elegance and purity sadly they can’t appreciate it.
=
Todas foram tão bem!
=
유아 되게 야망있는 체리마루같음
=
These women can carry the entire kpop industry on their shoulder.
=
찬미 개멋져
=
which song did moonbyul perform
=
Moonbyul my lesbian queen 😷💖💖💖
=
Where the f is Eunji's solo performance?! Not fair!!
=
Yein is sooo good. can anyone interpret her dance? seems like there’s story behind it. it would be interesting to know.
=
It’s unfair that Eunji didn’t have a solo which automatically put bom in last place :/. She should have had solo stage at least...
=
1:38
=
Why did Bom not perform?
=
Mamamoo looks like they did not care of anything. They just having fun and follow the flow.
=
이미주가 안나오고 예인이 나온 이유가 있엇네.. 전략 잘 짯당
=
me: yeah I'm bi but not really inclined to women
moonbyul: 10:24
my gay lil' heart: 😍💥
=
워 대박
=
저의 개인순위
1.유아님
2.문별님
3.예인님
4.은지님(박봄분신)
5.수진님
6.찬미님
=
암넷 점수를 보여달라
=
*love how fans are mad at result of yein being 4th because she literally deserves 1st in terms of everything*
=
Yein should have ranked at least 2nd. Yooa did amazing. Fighting OMG and Lovelyz!
=
Yooa and Yein were on another level . Eunji too did great
=
Im the group dance, yein and moonbyul keep smiling. They're sho cutee
=
10:19 me and my wig
=
Can you give me compilation of Solar's reaction? HAHAHA
=
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE PERFORMED LITTLE MIX OMG I'M CRYING
=
MOST ICONIC PERFORMANCE IN KPOP EVER
=
7:45 mamamoo looks like they are watching moonbyul from their living room
=
3:41 I CAN’T WITH SOLAR-
=
i wish it have dance tutorial 😭
=
OMG!! Moonbyul really make me fall for her even deeper aishh.. Mina forgive me 😩😍❤
=
10:01 슈화 나 눈물 나뻐내~ (사망)
=
수진아......ㅜㅜ 같은 여자지만 섹쉬하고 존멋...soojin♡♡
=
이건 뭐 퀄리티가 미쳤다 진짜... 1분 1초가 주옥 같음 그리고 다들 너무너무 열심히 하는 게 보여서 더 대단해
=
예인 진짜 잘했는데 표정이 아쉽다.. 마지막에 손내리는데 저게 사람얼굴이냐구 진짜 그래픽같아
유아가 진짜 지리네 왁킹 부터가.. ㅎㄷ
=
수진 진짜..... 전소연 빼면 아이들 최고의 보석인듯.... 어디서 저런 표정연기가 나오는지...ㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 표정 미쳤...♡♡♡♡
=
yooa OMG I LOVE
=
Soojin looks so dirty
=
문별이 왕자님 같아... 승희는 공주님...
=
THEY PERFORMED STRIP AND POWER? OMG THE TALENT
=
*the first girl kinda looks like jungkook of bts, (or is it just me?)*
=
와.. 얼마나 열심히 연습했을까.. 그 땀과 눈물에 모두에게 박수 칩니다 마지막 power 보는데.. 막 소름이 ㅎㅎㅎ
=
I almost cry because damn, soojin, girl I'm so gay for you
=
4:45 야망있는 체리마루🍒
=
Whoaaaaaaa soojin eonni!!!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍💣💣💣
=
유아 왁킹 미쳤네;;
=
So sad that chanmi being slept on , that performance is so powerful , she deserve better
=
와 예인이 너무 잘한다...뭐랄까 너무 고급짐...
=
이건 진짜 누가 우열을 가린다 하는 정도가 아니라 너무 다 잘했음 진짜 너무 잘한다 마지막 단체 퍼포먼스까지..개인인데도 불구하고 그 팀의 자존심이다보니 그 팀의 실력이 높아보이는 느낌까지 듦 진짜 멋있다 전부 10분 이상의 영상인데도 불구하고 계속 돌려봤어요 너무 잘 봤습니다
=
어떻게 예인이 4위지??...난 1~2위 생각했는데....;    솔직히 문별은 하위권인줄알았는데.... (지나가던 머글)
=
Best part of the performance: all my girls slaying! 
Second best part: Hyejeong's narration and reactions!
=
처음에 정예인이 미쳤다..ㄹㅇ 현대무용해봐서 그런지 춤선도 너무좋고 노래선곡도 너무 잘했고 다 너무 잘어울렸던 무대..
=
컨셉을 친절한 금자씨로 잡은 것도 명대사 나레이션 넣은 것도 신의 한수였음...
=
예인 춤선 미쳤고 선곡 진짜 대박이다 수진이는 춤이 엄청 고급지고 야한? 춤인데 야해보이지 않고 고혹적이고 멋있다
=
정예인님 맨날 상큼발랄 이미지여서 다른 모습을 못봤는데 여기서 진짜 이미지 다른 모습보고서 심쿵함 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ그리고 역시 데뷔한 가수의 짬바는 ㄹㅇ...장난아님을 느꼇음돠 ㅠㅠ
한국어 댓이 넘 안보여서 써봐영ㅋㅋ
=
유아가 원한 그림 : 카리스마 넘치는 마피아 보스
우리가 본 그림 : 카리스마 있는 보스베이비
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 멋있음과 귀여움이 동시에 존재하는  완벽한 무대였음
=
10:26. 8:30
=
1:03 whats name?
=
은지라는 분 일부러 밀어줄려고 박봄이 넣은건데 다들 한번씩 잡히는 카메라 왜 안잡히냐,,
=
ユラちゃんマジダンスうめえな。
=
유샤샤 진짜 마피아 조직보스 같애 순둥순둥하게 생겨갖고 마피아조직 수사하는 형사한테 평범한 조력자인 척 다가가서 신뢰감 쌓으며 이것저것 도와주는 척 할거같다구 형사랑 같이 조직에 잠입해서 마피아 보스가 있는 문 앞만 남겨두고 태연히 문 열고 들어가면서 어서와 내가 여기 보스야 하는 샤샤ㅠ 멘탈 무너지는 형사 얼굴 보면서 깔깔 웃으면서도 한편으로는 연기뿐인 관계였지만 조금은 이 친구한테 마음을 열었는지 안타까운 마음.. 조직원 불러들여서 함정 파 놓을 수도 있었지만 마지막에 1대 1로 싸우는 쪽을 택하고 결국 패배해서 자신의 안타까운 사연을 말하면서 순순히 잡혀주는 척 하다가 경찰서로 이송되는 차 미리 수배해서 유유히 빠져나가는 마피아 보스 유시아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
i wonder how hui would feel after watching soojins performance
=
Name of the song Moonbyul is taking ?
=
오마이걸이랑 아이들 팬인데 솔직히 이번건 러블리즈가 찢었다.. 정예인 보고 너무 신선하게 충격먹어서 그후의 무대 잘 기억안남
=
0:08 who is she??
=
Where is seolhyun ?
=
who's dancing in smooth criminal plss
=
Is that somi?
=
ANJIR KEREN BGT SINTINGG
=
수진이랑 유아는 잘추는거 알았는데 찬미랑 예인이랑 문별이 이렇게 잘추는줄 몰랐음 이런 무대좀 많았으면
=
WHY THE HELL CHANMI GOT 5th PLACE???!!!
=
나 늉물 날뻐내
=
예인 오프닝보러 계속 들어와요 누가 나좀 멈춰줘..... 선곡 연기 춤 임팩트 너무 레전드야.. 이 중에 춤 자체를 진짜 잘춘다고 느낀건 유아 개인무대. 수진이는 그냥 다 유혹하고 찢어버리려고 나온듯 ㅎㅎㅎ 단체에서 수진 표정만 계속 봐...
=
Moonbyullll😘😘😘
=
At first I didn't believe that Little Mix has some popularity in South Korea, but now that I'm watching this knowing one of my favorite girl groups just danced to STRIP I can definitely believe it now.
=
근데 확실히 경력이 짱이다.. 단체 무대 하기 전에 은지님 퍼포 끝나고 단체 씬에 유아님이랑 수진님은 표정에 약간 긴장이 있는데 찬미님이랑 예인님은 여유가 넘치셔..
=
How come Park Bom couldn't perform?
=
정예인 춤선 너무 깔끔하고 서수진은 그냥 여자도 반할 거 같다

예인이는 두번 실패 후에 컨셉 선택 힘들었을 텐데 곡 선택부터 무대 연출까지 진짜 완벽했고 수진은 늘 그랬듯이 자신이 제일 잘할 수 있는 걸 최대로 보여주는 듯 ㅜㅜㅜㅠ 퀸덤 회차 연장하자 🔥🔥
=
Whats the name of the music of 1st solo performer??
=
언니 달은 두개지만 내 심장은 하나야
=
YOOAAAAAA GOSH
=
솔직히 마마무 팬들이 도대체 어디가 잘못한건지 모르겠는데요... 밸런스 잘못 조절한 암넷탓아닌가요...
=
예인이 컨셉 너무 잘 잡았고 
유아는 표정이 진짜 좋다
=
Who likes Chanmi??
=
I am not even a Kpop fan.................








Yet I can't stop re watching this over and over
=
Dude went down like a sim
=
Girls groups can dance better then boys group💃🏻YAAAA
=
아니 글고 이렇게 현대무용 쩌는 애가 그동안 러블리 상큼 애교 춤 추고 있었다는 것도 뭔가... 안타깝다 진짜 정예인 재발견
=
CHANMI 🖤
=
와이건 정예인이 압도했다 진짜ㅠ 다른멤버도 넘잘했는데 진짜독보적이다
=
yooa is my fav.   too good
=
yooa!
=
원래 퀸덤보고 정예인한테 감겨서 이번 무대 엄청 기대하고 잇엇는데 그 이상이라 진짜... 눈물낫다 좋아한지 한 달도 안 됏는데 내가 키운 느낌임 무대 보면서 왤케 대견햇는지 그냥... 댄스 퍼포는 진짜 정예인이 찢엇다 정예인 존나 사랑해...
=
Chanmi rank fifth wtf
=
이렇게 보석을 갖고 빛나는..수많은 연습을 걸친 프로들이 많은데..무대를 열어주니 참 잘하고 멋지네요!계속 무대에 서게해주세요
=
유아가 대박이네.. 인형같은얼굴로
=
the real deal is here.. #moonbyul
=
예인 춤선이랑 음악이 너무 잘 어울린다... 다른 노래들이랑 차별화가 있어서 그런지 신선하고 기억에 남음
=
Whoooaaaa Chanmi got so much robbed in my opinion !! The camera during her solo performance didn't follow her move really well IN MY OPINION (but I'm not a professionnal omg) and during the group performance, have you seen her ? Me no ... even when she was at the center she didn't get the cam (Like yein and eunji btw). 
And Eunji ... poor girl ... that's so unfair for her, she didn't get a solo performance and same in the group performance as chanmi ... 

But for Chanmi ... I'M SO MAD OMMG
=
유아 미쳤네 박자감각 미쳤네 비밀정원때 처음 배운 왁킹 실력 미쳤어
=
이걸그룹잘 모르는데 친절한금자씨한 분이 가장 기억에남고 연기력과 분위기 등등 감탄함...
=
이거 순위 어케 나왔어요?
=
메인댄서 미주가 다리부상 때문에 예인이가 대신 나온건데 춤선 진짜 이쁜건 알고 있었지만 이 정도일 줄은 꿈에도 몰랐음.. 친절한 금자씨 영화 본 사람들은 진짜 소름 돋을꺼임. 영화내용을 현대무용과 춤으로 풀어낼 줄은.. 진짜 영화 한 편 본 것 같음ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 예인이가 98년생인데도 아이디어랑 표현력이 대단한 듯.
=
Hey, who's the girl dancing to Smooth Criminal by Michael Jackson??
=
We got the power. Go girls
=
It should’ve been
1.Yein
2.Soojin
3.Moonbyul
4.Yooa
5. The 3rd girl ı dont know her sorry
=
yooaaaaaaaaa
=
유시아 서수진 당신들뭐야,,,, 나 눈물로 태평양 만들었어,,,,,,,
=
I so don't agree with the final rankings... I mean Yein was just amazing, does she have ballet training ? And how did Chanmi end up in 5th place? She did amazing, was on rhythm and was bold enough to start without any music...
=
Soojin killed this
=
it should be
1. Yooa/Yein
2. Yein/Yooa
3. Soojin
4. Moonbyul
5. Chanmi
6. Eun ji
=
Who's like moonbyul like
=
예인이 다 찢었다;;;; 미쳤다 진짜 이게 뭐야 걍 입벌리고 봤네
=
Can someone please explain to me about Park Bom performance. I don't understand
=
This is all scripted..  ...
Mnet is earing alot through this but the idol were confused becoz mnet evil editing.. 
That's why kpoo idols deals with depression.. 

Evil editing plus..  Spread love kindness...  U all are good on singing dancing.. 
If I am ur ceo I won't sign this type of work for my idol... 


See....

Even the expression as well as the body language.. 
.
Even when I am surprised I don't even react that way... 




How many victims will u create..  Mnet..

나만 단체무대때 문별나오고나서 확 깨나..?

Who thought when soojin said senorita , she meant the idle one and not the shawn mendes one
=
0:00 LOVELYZ Yein
1:33 GIDLE Soojin
3:05 AOA Chanmi
4:36 OHMYGIRL Yooa
6:09 MAMAMOO Moonbyul

8:34 Six Puzzle 💕
=
0:02 song??

서바이벌? 프로그램 같은데서 맨날 연습생 위주만 보다가 현역 아이돌 실력 보니까 와,,,,, 찐은 찐이다,,,,
손끝에까지 힘이있고 시선처리는 기본 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜ
=
무무지만 .. 개인적으로 춤알못이긴해도 문별 단체군무 먼가 반박자? 정도 빠른거같은건 기분탓인가..ㅜ 먼가아쉽다 멋있긴 한데
=
다른것보다 예인 표정연기가 오지지않음...? 약간 오싹쓰 여긴안보이는데 입가리고 웃는거랑 후 하기전에 손으로 얼굴가릴때 목에힘들어가는거 크 지렸음
=
honestly, i don't even care about the rank anymore. the comment section and the fact that she went viral is proof enough of who owned this challenge. YEIN YOU HAVE MY WHOLE HEART
=
*Personal Ranking*
1. Yooa
2. Yein
3. Soojin
4. Moonbyul
5. Chanmi
Not ranking Eunji because she didn't do a solo, but she's my favorite, please check her group out!! Brave Girls ^^
=
for me rank 1 - 3 is
-Lovelyz Yein
-Oh My Girl Yooa
-(G)idle Soojin

i like moonbyul but i think yein deserves it
=
등수가 아닌 표수로 점수합산된게 방송에서 친절히 설명됐으면 좋았을텐데 
등수로만 다 기뻐하고 슬퍼하고 방송에서 등수만 부각시키니 
예인 응원했던 사람으로서 기분더럽네요 ㅠㅠ
1등과 불과9표차이 아무도 못보게 아주작은글씨로 1초만에 흘리고 말이지 
저사실을 다들 방송보고도 모르니 왜 예인이 4위? 라는 반응들이 나오는거죠
예인이나 러블리즈멤버들은 4등이란것만 알고 풀이죽은모습만 나왔네
=
예인 유아 개인무대 개쩔고 무엇보다 단체무대 ㄹㅇ오짐.. 드랍 나올 때 소름돋아
=
The first two girls are amazing
=
Yooa and yein killed it
=
Yein is just... explosive... she stood out even among the 6, 9:56 focus was cut a bit too short, i wanna see her dance a few more secs to that drop
=
They dance so good, Soojin, member of Lovelyz and Oh My Girl are good too. Power are coolll~~~
However, there are too much reaction in this vid, and it's inconvenience
=
The clownery that is moonbyul got 2nd place over lovelyz and idle. Choices.
=
I STILL think Yeein, chanmi and Soojin shouldve been in the Top 3
=
YooA and yein stole the show for me💕
=
I just really love the entrance of Brave Girls Eunji. Hahahhahah
That cool aura. How I wish she could show more.
=
watch me being lesbian after this
=
4:55 chaeyeon?
=
Dancing skills/ability I would put YooA at number 1, though for this performance only I would hand it to Yein.

I really was hoping to see OMG YooA against Lovelyz Mijoo.

It really is painful sometimes to be fans of multiple groups.
=
2:32 귀여워 ㅠ
=
OMG YooA... she is wow... amazing girl
=
예인이 표정연기가지고 뭐라고 하는사람들 있는데 친절한 금자씨 본사람들은 뭐라 못할듯 지금 나오는 예인이 표정연기가 맞는거임
=
I would love to see her perform with kai 🙏
=
8:53 언니 눈썹 뭐야ㅜㅜㅠ 내 심장 뛰었어ㅜㅜㅠㅜㅜㅠ
=
우리 수진이도 대단하지만 문별누님 대단하십니다..
=
watch me being lesbian after this
=
Soojin and Moonbyul really brought the gay out of me 😳🤚🏼
=
Top 3 for me was soojin,moonbyul and yein fight me
=
예인 넘모 예쁘고 잘한다 ㅜㅜ
=
I don't care about the ranking AOA' s "it's our maknae!!!" Makes my day.
=
moonbyul and yooa is the best <3
=
2:05 Mimi is everyone
=
식스퍼즐 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 이름도 너무 좋고 미춌다 미쳤어  ㅠㅠ 본방 보면서 거의 눈물 찔끔 흘렸는데 또 이렇ㄱ ㅔ 눈물이 나네요... 또 한 번 붙어주세요.. 진짜 이 무대에서 모두가 일등 입니다.. 은지씨도 너무 멋있었어요 ㅠㅠㅠ 나와주셔서 감사해요 정말 으악 너무 좋아ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 퀸덤 사랑해.. 내년에 퀸덤2 해줘요.. .제발... 제발요... 제발제발제발......... ...
=
Let them debut together even just for a little while
=
아 이제 얘들 다 정들어서 안되겠다 돌려가면서 1위 한번씩 주고 꼴찌 주고 끝날 때까지 같이 가자 그냥

=
YOOA GURL YOU SLAY

When the lyrics says "YOUR THE MAN" and they zoom it to MOONBYUL
=
He's going more crazy at 10:19
=
그냥 ㅅㅂ 이 프로그램에서는 마지막에 모든 그룹 컴백쇼 시켜줘도 별 말 없을 것 같음 진짜 엠넷 제발...
=
I found out Yooa won even before watching the performance and at first i was like.. They're all so good how did Yooa win all of that?? But her part had me pregnant the most i got goosebumps all over my arms... I've been with Oh My Girl since their debut and Ive seen ALL Yooa's dance.. From hit the stage to 1million studio to Queendom. She has always been out there for her dancing.. But how can u really stand out when everyone is so good. I legit cried cause, people appreciated her dance here.


Edited; Im a girlgroup Stan, so I really enjoyed the others, everyone did so well.. I also think Yein deserved better and EunJin should have a solo part as well, they did bad for Bom and her here. But itsokay, we cant do anything about it now since its over
=
Does Jimin have a tattoo
=
Moonbyul dancing to Camila Cabello and Little Mix. We have to stan

수진~~~ 으른 섹시♥♥♥ 언니 설레게하지마 ㅎㅎ

문별님 저... 저 죽어요................

본방으로 봤을때는 무무지만 별언니가 군무 안맞는다고 생각했었었는데 직캠보니까 춤 겁나 잘추네 춤선이랑 스타일이 다른거였어
=
10:01
=
친절한금자씨 진짜 상상도 못했다 미쳤다 와 진짜 진짜로 찢어놨다 와ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
I cant believe how awful was the camera work
=
u dont have to wear minim clothes to prove u r sexy n hv charisma on stage.

Why didnt bom perform with them?
=
와..친절한 금자씨 이게 이렇게 표현이 되네 예인이 잘했다ㅠㅠ 수진은 무대만 올라가면 왜 다른 사람이 되냐 진짜 다른 사람임ㄷㄷ
=
확실히 춤을 다 잘 추니까 표정 연기 잘 하는 친구한테 눈이 더 간다 찬미 걍 연기 미쳤네 수진이랑 둘이 무대 찢었다.
=
soojin want me to die already
=
Moonbyul just on another level😭 The only one who didn’t try to dance sexy but still could easily slay❤️
=
예인 춤선 진짜 예쁘다. 흰얼굴 그대로 보다는 대사처럼 얼굴에 붉은색으로 파격적으로 분장했으면 더 쩔었을듯.
=
유시아 무대할 때 유독 반응많고 완전 좋아하는 러블리즈... 특히 이미주 베이비소울 진짜 개 좋아하고 표정 변화 별로 없던 유지애가 유시아 무대할 때 엄마 미소 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 오마이걸 개좋아한다 러블리즈
=
예인이랑 유아가 젤 잘했네! 특히 예인은 다시봤음!
=
가수들도 그렇겠지만 팬들도 엄청 좋겠다 ㅠㅠ 
예인은 몸선이 예쁘고 우아해서 피겨했으면 어땠을지 궁금함
=
수진이랑 예인 유아 이렇게 세분이 끝나고 계속 여운남는듯 ..최고
=
Chanmi and that girl dancing to Senorita got me shook
=
Who also think YEIN of Lovelyz should be in TOP 3？(the girl performed first)
👇If you agree.
=
예인 진짜 저런 인재를 두고도 활용을 못하냐....
=
애들 다 잘했는데 당최 한국유튜브버전인데 한국어댓글이 위에 있어야하는거 아닌가 유튜브진짜ㅡㅡ
=
정예인 진짜 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 무슨 예술영화의 한장면인줄 개소름이다 와
=
Soojin is the sexiest girl ever 😭😭 shuhua is died
=
I love all of them, but damn, no one hits me like Soojin...
=
진짜 예인이 친절한금자씨 대사 따라할때 소름돋음 미쳤어 ㅋㅋ 원래 (여자)아이들 보러 왔는데 진짜 다 잘함 ㅋㅋ
=
난 문별
=
soojin said: *this is a gay-only event*
=
*WHO WAS THE GIRL THAT DID SMOOTH CRIMINAL I MUST KNOW WHERE ALL THAT TALENT LIES*
=
Soojin has the most impact on me ahhh
=
zh这个是什么韩国节目 ~~有中文版的语言翻译吗
=
Anyone vote for Moonbyul? *She's very powerful*
👇
=
와 유아 대단하다 저 작은 체구로도 저 느낌을 내네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 대박인듯ㅋㅋㅋ 보면서 감탄함
=
어째서 정예인이 상위권이 아닌거지..
=
진짜ㅏ...친절한 금자씨 ost 선택은 진짜로 대박이라고밖에 못하겠어 진짜 대박이야....
=
Still don't understand why Yein only Rank no. 4 T.T
For me, YooA is no.1, Yein is no.2
=
damn soojin. Calm down, i can’t resist your hotness
=
솔직히 정예인이 왜 4위인지 모르겠음
=
예인 춤 추는 것 보고 계속 생각남 표정 진짜 너무 프로다
=
Yooa
Yein
Soojin
Top3 for me thou everyone did great💛
=
정예인을 스타트로 끊다니.. 오져.. 너무 대박이라고..
=
Both Yein and YooA impressed me.
=
예인님 못해도 3등안에는 들거라고 생가핬는데ㅠㅠ 아쉽댜ㅠㅠㅠ
=
예인 무대 상위권 아닌 4위인게 이상했지만 방송끝나고 점수표 캡쳐 보니 
1위가 109표, 4위가 101표. 4위까지 몇표씩 거의 차아가 안남 5위는 50표대인데...
그럼 표수가 높았는데도 4위했다 이런것도 나왔어야지 방송에선 등수만 부각시킴;;
예인이가 4위라 애써 웃으면서 티는 안내도 아쉬워하는 모습이 고스란히 잡혀서 맘아팠음 
언니들이 좋아해주면 됐다면서ㅠㅠ
=
Yein should have gotten a higher ranking 😭😭
=
유아 진짜 생각보다 그릇이 큰사람이였구나를 느낌,,표정이 진짜 펑키하면서 약간 아무튼 짱임
=
YOOA GETS ME IMPRESSED, DAMN GURL
=
Jung YEIN the prettiest ♥️
=
진짜 다이아몬드 같은 인재가 정말 많다 몇번을 봐도 소름이고.....소속사들만 일 잘하면 됨 걍 원래 다 잘하는 사람들이라 소속사들만 일 잘 하면 끝장날듯
=
서수진 3위 예인 4위 가 제일 미스테리다 우웩
=
마마무는 진짜 팬덤빨 맞네 네이버 , 트위터 , 페북
유튜브 각종 SNS 다 문별 아쉽단 이야기 밖에없는데
어떡해 찬미 정예인 수진을 이길수가 있냐고
=
YEIN GOT 4TH????? NAH
=
9:03 yein's powerful pop tho' OMGG Im in love with all of her facial expression She killed all of it!! Im proud of her!! Her performance had me speechless  srsly OMGGG ㅠㅠ
=
Yein, Yooa and soojin is my faves here 😍
=
YEIN IS THE BEST!!!!!👑👑👑👑👑👑👑😍😍😍😍😍💃🌹❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

I really don’t think chanmi deserved 5th place:(

Who likes Moonbyul 💜🙆
👇
=
THE SMOOTH CRIMINAL ONE WAS THE BEST OMGG
=
That one is me 😂 like I was laughing so hard 😂😂😂
=
10:19 I feel him
=
이 무대만 보고는 도저히 예인이 왜 4등인지 모르겠다  적어도 유아랑 예인이 1 2등인데
=
holy cheese tje MJ girl did amazing!
=
아 예인이 춤선은 기가 막히는데 표정연기가 너무 아쉽다 진짜 레전드급인데ㅠㅠㅠ무대연출이며
=
I didn't know about this show but finally understand what the hype is all aboiut
MOONBYUL *_*
=
YEIN really did a great job in the beginning dance~🔥 So elegant and so beautiful~💖
YOOA is literally the queen of EVERYTHING~👑 She's just so amazing~🌸
I'M TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH MOONBYUL FOR SURE~💙

=
YEIN and YooA were the best
=
I love how Mamamoo always stay calm whenever they watch performances of this show and 😂 do not really react much but only Solar with full of memeable face 😂 .
=
와 예인누님 반했슴둥
=
아니 왜 수진이 언급없지? ㅜㅜ
수진 완전 대박인데 ㅜㅜㅜ
=
유아 춤 잘추는 건 알고 있었는데 ㅈㄴ 멋있다
=
ANNIE ARE YOU OK? that meme was all i was thinking but really good performance Yooa i also loved Soojins performance
=
개인의견으로는 1)정예인 2)유아
=
정예인 진짜 와.. 무대를 찢어놨다.. ㄷㄷ
=
수진 ㅁㅊㄷ ㅁㅊㅇ
=
Queen Eunji!
=
This performance was beyond good. But aside from that, I just really wanted to acknowledge my bias, Chanmi. As an Elvis, she didn't really have the time to showcase her dancing skills, so I'm really proud that she got to show it here, together with these amazing at talented people like her. I felt really satisfied when I saw her unnies' reaction to her performance. 

This performance is so legendary, I'm sure it will leave a big mark in the kpop industry and I'm proud to be an elvis and moomoo. 

Not a fan of Lovelyz and OMG but Yein and YooA did super great despite having innocent faces (that could have affect their performance but they're such queens). And Soojin made me question my sexuality😂 


These girls are so talented but Moonbyul's (bias💖) charisma and stage presence is on another level👑
=
수진 ❤️
=
Am I the only one who noticed Shuhua at 2:57
=
Who's the center?
=
뭐가이렇게 사이다임.... 판깔아주니까 미친듯이 놀자나 물만난 물고기처럼 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 진짜 이런 실력자들을 여태 썩히고있었다니.... 부들부들....
=
군무... 여자의 외모는 무기다... 거기에 요즘 핫한 안무돋보이기 의상까지 장착했다 예인이가... 자신의 주특을 제대로 알린 퀸덤이 아닌가 싶다... 그리고 멀리서도 제대로 눈길을 끌수있는건 역시나 머리카락이 살아 움직여주면서 눈길을 확끌어 당긴 찬미... 살짝 엇박자의 논란이 있었다... 머 이정도면 그런거 1도 없었다고 넘어갈만도 했지만... 그러나 모두다 정박자로 춤을 췄다... 단 개인간의 차이가 이런 논란을 만들었지 싶다... 스피드가 좋은 안무가 일수록 더더욱 정확한 타이밍까지 끊고 다음동작들을 정확히 춤춘다... 동작만을 순서대로 외워서 체조처럼 춤추는게 아니라 시간안배를 잘할수록 사람들의 눈을 사로잡는 효과가 나타나는 법이다... 안무에서 중요한점들이 여럿 있겠지만... 유아의 가장 큰 장점이 빠른 스피드이다... 동작을 남보다 먼저한다는게 아니라 더 작은시간에 같은 동작들을 소화할수 있으므로 길게 늘여주거나 서서히 보여주는 부분에서 충분히 여백을 주고 짧은시간에 다음동작으로 넘어갈수 있는 스피드이다...
=
Soojin & moonbyul 🖤🖤🖤🖤
=
09:28 wow,,
=
예인이 처음에 바이올린 따라라라 따라서 움직일때 마다 소름이 아주....미쳤어

다들 잘했다. 그러나 여돌에게 평소 몸에 익숙한 베이스로 구성한 것이라 생각드는거에 비해  마이클잭슨의 느낌을 살리는 일은 하루이틀해선 안되는건데 유아는 평소에 했다는거다. 해야하는 춤이 아닌 하고싶은 춤을 해왔다는 의미.
=
근데 유아 파트는 직캠으로 봐야됨 직캠으로 보면 더 파워풀함
=
걸그룹의 춤의 완성은 머리카락에서 나온다... 앞선 퀸덤 공연에서도 보여줬듯 찬미의 머리카락이 안무의 완성을 이뤘다... 정확한 동작과 절도와 활동력이 완성되야만 머리카락들이 살아 움직인다... 많은 아쉬운점이 있음에도 겉보이기에만 몰두함이 아닌 기본을 정확히한 결과가 나와서 박수쳐주고 싶다... 5위여서 아쉬울뿐...
=
근데 티비에서 나올때 리액션 빼면 안되나.. 무대만 보고 싶다고
=
YOOA I LOVE U
=
I’m gay for Soojin 😳
=
은지 개인무대 왜 없음.....?
=
bom representative doesnt perform on her own?
=
YooA should win this
=
10:23 - 10:25
=
전문 안무 치곤 살짝 뻣뻣한 문별이... 그런데 이정도로 하면 이젠 문별스러움이라고 해야될듯... 오히려 그런 남성스런 이미지로 시크함을 보여주는 라스트 장면은 정말 어색한듯 하면서도 눈길을 끈다... 그리고 짧은 경연에서 소화하기 힘든 부채라는 소재를 펼치기까지 했다 싶었다... 초반 악센트만 주고 얼른 버렸다... 잘했따 ㅋㅋㅋ
=
와 예인은 임펙트랑 연기 개쩔고 수진은 분위기랑 섹시함 개쩔고 유아는 관절 자유자제로 쓰는게 기술 개쩐다
=
와 진짜 그룹명 식스퍼즐 여섯명이 모여서 퍼즐이 맞춰진다 막 이랬을때부터 알아봤는데. 진짜 완벽했어 다들 어쩜 개인무대 때 자기랑 어울리는 무대를 할 수가 있지 그리고 박봄이랑 은지랑 하이파이브하면서 바톤터치파는데 세상소름 다돋음. 솔직히 연습시간 많이 부족했을텐데 이정도 진짜 완벽아님?!!본방으로 보는데 계속 소름돋았고. 진짜 이멤버 그대로 한번 더 무대서주면 소원이 없겠음ㅠㅠ
=
전세계 통틀어 아이돌 실력은 대한민국이 원탑,,
=
왜 외국인뿐이야...한국어로 공감 형성 하고 싶단 말야...
=
*When MOONBYUL is more handsome than your OPPA*
=
Yein: fairy
Soojin: damn gays
Chanmi: sexy
YooA: slayed
Moonbyul: confirmed is our official oppa

ALL OF THEM LEAVING US LESBIANS
=
유아쩐다
=
정예인 먼지한톨도 용납 못하는 덤블링
서수진 카라멜 녹은거마냥 안떨어지는 끈적함
유시아 마이클잭슨이 주니어로 친히 부활
문별이 조선시대와 접신하시매 눈물한방울이 안아까운 무대
찬미티티 미국 셀럽이 비행기 끌고 한국와서 한반도 지진나게 해주심에
모두들 감사드리는바에 있습니다
=
YooA is actually smart when cover her face with the hat, as she has a pretty and cute face, it’s be more difficult to convey the swagger of MJ’s song, and it creates extra mystery to the song. I like Yein and YooA the most
=
평소 오디션 프로그램 즐겨보는데 최근 유행하던 프듀 아이돌학교 뭐 이런거 보다가 퀸덤보니까 와 무대 클라쓰가 이렇게 다르나싶다 역시 프로는 프로..  매번 무대 하나하나 완벽하고 거의 연말시상식급이다 그냥 너무 재밌다 무대 하나하나 놓칠수가 없고 다 좋다 그냥 몇번을 반복해서 보는건지 셀 수도 없다  프듀도 정말 재밌게봤다 생각했는데 퀸덤보니까 아마추어수준도 아닌것같다
=
친절한 금자씨 보려고 계속 들어옵니다,,,진짜 되게 뭔가 신선하면서 충격적인 컨셉이다 퇴폐미도 대박이고 갓예인,,,진짜 춤선 오진다 ㅠ
=
I can't believe yein get 4 rank, i think 1 or 2 is yein or yooa.
=
솔직히 예인이랑 유아가 진짜 잘한거같은데 예인이 생각보다 순위가 낮아서 아쉬웠슴...ㅠ
=
All the girls did well but Yein was robbed with that rank. Well at least she's the one who got viral and got recognition she deserved
=
와 예인 미쳤다 보다가 소름이 쫘악!!!몇번돌려봤네 진짜 완벽하다 춤선표정 다미쳤다
=
확실히 이번 경연을 통해 느낀건데 우리가 티비로 보는 무대하고 현장에서 무대하고는 다르겠구나... 우리가 보는 무대는 카메라와 컨택하면서 모든 장면을 클로즈업해서 보니까 표정같은게 잘보이는데 무대에서는 전체 무대가 보이니까 현장무대에서는 무대를 꽉채우는게 필요하고 또 표정연기도 잘해야한다는 생각이 드네...
=
JUNG YEIN WAS ROBBED DAMN IT
=
춤 반경 범위가 넓은 현대무용은 카메라도 넓게 잡아야하는데 진짜 초반 몇초빼고 너무 잘잡음
=
한국에서 마이클잭슨 춤춘 사람 중 최고로 잘  춘거같다
=
YOOA GOT ME ON THE FLOOR LIKE SKAKXMDMCODMDJD
=
유아만 정박이네...왁킹도 진짜 잘한다... 춤 배우고있는데도 저정도까지 못추는데 대박...
=
Yein and YooA were the best 👏👏👌 they both did very different concepts from the others and weren’t the typical types of dances that everyone else did.
=
If you watch Eunji's fancam you can literally see that she dances with more energy than all of the girls. Maybe because she didn't get a solo
=
진짜 예진한테 친절한 금자씨 독후감 비슷한거 써보라 하고 싶다ㅠㅠ 어떻게 저런식으로 해석 할 수 있지?
=
정말 어떤 팀의 누구인지를 떠나서 다들 너무 멋지고 우리나라 여자 아이돌의 무대연출 수준이 이정도라는거에 너무 자부심 느껴지네요ㅠㅠ
퀸덤 방송을 통해서 이런 모습을 알수있어서 정말 좋아요!!  서로 감탄해주는 모습도 너무 이쁩니다
=
Yein ～～～～～～
=
Personally love moonbyul's and yein's performance ❤️but everyone is so gooooodddd
=
YooA was legendary... the switch from lovely innocent concepts to this?? and her adorableness in that power suit??? And the dance??? She could moon dance on my corpse and id thank her. 
We need a whole comeback like this.
=
I wish Moonbyul would look down at the ground less! Love herrrr
=
im so sad Chanmi got 5th place :(( i wish this wasn't a competition, just a collab
=
Okay umm, I’m in love with all of them. I seriously don’t know how y’all can choose
=
dance unit ranking:
1. Yooa 
2. Moonbyul 
3. Soojin
4. Yein
5. Chanmi
6. Eunji
=
They did it amazing but Yein and Yooa were another level 💖💖 how No one say they are one of the best kpop dancers 💔💔
=
WOAAAAH! THIS IS CRAZY!  Wonder how it feels to be in the crowd, coz it feels like a FULL CONCERT! WOOOOOOAAH
=
개인무대만 보면 예인이가 진짜 눈에 확 들어오구 종합적으론 수진이랑 유아...! 가 대박인거같다ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 그리구 찬미랑 문별이 이렇게 춤잘추는줄 몰랐음 다 너무 수고했어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 식스퍼즐 연말스페셜무대 가자아아!!!!
=
와,,,,,, 진짜 하나하나 개성있고 잘어울리고 마지막 단체때도 누구 하나 묻히지않고 각자의 매력이 넘친다 ,,,, 개멋있다 진짜...,,

=
나는 수진이랑 유아 무대가 쩰 기억에 남는다❤
=
yein lov yu
=
정예인 때문에 맨날 보러옴 ㅎㅎㅎ
=
와 여잔데 문별 진짜 너무 멋있어 언니 날 가져요ㅠㅠㅠ
=
유아...귀여운 얼굴에 그렇지 못한 춤.,.........ㅁㅓㅅ잇다ㅠㅜㅠㅜ
=
솔직히 문별 저렇게 춤 잘추는 지 몰랐는데 진짜 춤선 오져ㅠㅠㅠ
=
확실히 아이돌만드는프로젝트 이런 프로보다 프로느낌이든당 연예인들은 ㅋㅋ 한명한명 컨셉 너무좋고 중독성쩜 은지 마니못나와서 아쉽 ㅠ.ㅠ 근데 우기 말투 졸귀아닌가 나 이거 진자 모르겟어~~
=
2:32 hahaha ShuHua ♥
=
예인이 왜 4등임....
=
아쒸ㅠㅠ그냥 너무 멋있다는 소리밖에 안나온다
=
7:08  마마무 문별인데,  '베르사유의장미 오스칼' 만화주인공이 생각남. 멋있고, 예쁨.
=
예인이는 최소2등인데ㅜ
=
이영상 만 8번째 보는중.... 너무 잘하네
=
예인 진짜 소름 돋는다
=
솔직히 예인.... 처음에 "친절해 보일까봐." 하고 춤추는데 헉했다... 현대무용해서 그런지 선도 장난 아니게 예쁘고 표정연기 지려.... 그리고 유아 뭐야... 마이클 잭슨 컨셉 실화냐.... 심각하게 숨멋...유아한테 나라 줘라....ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
예인 수진 대박이다
=
서수진 섹시함에 남미까지 갔다와버렸자너......
=
진짜 문별이 저렇게 예뻤나 싶을정도로 (타팬임) 외모적으로 예쁘다기보다는 정말 사랑스러운 느낌이 들게 했달까 진짜 심장떨렸음 외모적으로 안예쁘다는게 아니라 문별 단체군무할때 단독샷 잡힐때마다 심장이 철렁거림 기억조작오짐 진짜
=
왜우리 수진이언니 얘기는없어요ㅠㅠㅠ
=
SOOJIN SO HOT <3
=
유시아 죽도록 사랑해.....;;;....;;;;;;;
=
수진 미친ㄴ거 아니야..? 저세상 섹시....0
=
Eunji deserves to have a solo too! 😔
=
itll be alot cooler if there's no wowww wowww woww reactions ads :3
=
Soojin killing me 😍😍😍😍💯
=
와..박봄님 보러 영상 들어갔다가..문별님한테 반함..컼 너무 멋있어..

Death: I be right here waiting for you. May God bless you.
=
YOOA💕💕
=
OMG  soojin💛💕
=
마이클잭슨이 이런 노래와 춤을 88년도에 췄다는 게 더 충격적이다 ㄷㄷ
=
이제 퀸덤 투표 안볼란다.... 하..... 어이가없네.....무슨 예인이가 4등이냐...
=
다 미쳤다조졌다내마음도조졌다
언니들 발닦개 필요하면 불러요
=
유아가 예쁘고  매력있네
=
Soojin OMGGGGGG
=
I cant stop watching this
=
은지쌤(?)이쁘다
=
처음부터 놀라면서 봤지만
유아는 처음 봤을때는 어특해
너무귀엽고 작은데 어특해..하면서
봤는데 모자쓰자마자 변신완료!!와우!!!!!!!
문스타 보면서 아쉬웠던게 딱 하나있다면 어두운조명.무대탓인지 검은 자켓때문에
춤이 잘보이지않아서 아쉬웠어요ㅠㅠ
그래도 다음무대바뀌고나서는 춤잘보이고 너무너무 잘하는모습 또 대에에바악...!!!!외치면서 보고와~~~~
마지막무대는 그냥 다필요없고
끝장나네요!!!와!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
다노출있고 섹시했는데 문별은
그렇지않아도 어울리고 함께한
무대 다들 너무너무너무 빛나서
간만에 눈+귀 개득템하고 갑니다^-^
=
Chanmi 5th?   She deserve to be in top3
=
아니...이건 진짜 정예인이 에바적으로 너무 멋졌다 우아해
=
Moonbyul ❤️🧡💛💚
=
개인 무대는 개인적으로 유아랑 예은인듯 일단 컨셉이 압도적이었던..... 친절한금자씨 오프닝은 정말 오래도록 회자될듯 표정 표현 다 너무 좋았다. 그리고 마이클잭슨이라니... 유아 포인트 중 하나가 입술인데 모자 쓰고 레드립만 보여준것도 난 너무 좋았고 완전 연출과 실력의 승리다
단체는 수진이랑 찬미가 제일 눈에 띄였다 분량은 다들 고만고만한것 같았는데 수진은 일단 표정이 너무 좋다보니까 몇 컷만 나와도 계속 본거같고 춤선이 너무 좋음 글고 찬미는 막 눈에 띈다기보단 단체무대를 세워놨을때 가장 잘 어우러지는거 같아서 대단한거같음
=
러블리즈 이번화에 이미지 회복을 넘어 갱신함;;; 쩔어
=
문별이 남돌댄스 보고싶다
=
유아 백댄서들 춤 왤캐 잘춰 둗 ㄷ
=
예인이가 초반에 다 찢어놨네~~칼 갈았구나 너무 멋져 미쳤어
=
mnet: moonbyul do you want a crop top and some shor-

moonbyul: how bout we stick to some nice suit and pants 

mnet: but the audience wan-

moonbyul: the audience love me even if i come through with pyjamas so pyjamas or suit you choose
=
식스퍼즐 중 가장 놀란건 예인이였음 오늘 케이 음색도 그렇고 세상에 저렇게나 끼와 재능 많은 아이들한테 계속 애교 시켰던건가
러블리즈가 왜 섹시 걸크러쉬하고 싶어했는지 알겠네

여섯명 다 걍 미쳤음 저렇게나 표현할 수 있는 컨셉의 폭이 넓은데 왜 청순 애교 섹시 밖에 없던건지
유아 마이클잭슨 보니 옴걸 수트 컨셉 한 번만 제발 ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
댓글 한참을 내렸는데도 한국어가 보이질 않네ㅜㅜ 한국인 보고 싶다
=
정예인 진짜 너무 소름돋고 춤선도 이쁘고  서수진 눈빛 미쳤고 개섹시하고 개개인 한명한명 너무 잘하고 소름돋음 유시아는 ㄹㅇ 마이클잭슨은 커버하기 제일 어렵다고 생각하는 그런 댄스가순데 그 마이클 잭슨이 생각 안났고 문별이랑 찬미도 그동안 못보던 매력 보여줘서 개소름돋음 그리고 6명 다 너무너무 합 잘맞고 춤도 멋있고 그냥 레전드 시상식에서 해줳으면
=
수진 개멋있다 춤 잘 추는 사람인 건 알았는데 저정도일줄은 몰랏ㄱ고 문별 너무 잘생김 언니 사랑합니다 제 평생을 가져다 바칠게요... 다음 주 예고.... 수진.... 존나.... 언니.... 사랑해요....
=
Shuhua will literally replay Soojin’s performance.

(I guess we’re all gonna replay it, or is it just me? But this whole performance is lit!)
=
썸바디에 나온 여자 현대무용수보다 정예인이 훨씬 잘 하네(발레리나 빼고) 막눈이 봐도 그들과 어깨랑 팔 쓰는 게 다르다. 정예인이 발 다쳐서 무용 접은 게 아쉽고 여태 이런 무대 보여줄 기회가 없던 게 또 아쉽네. 유아도 정말 멋지다. 다시 봤음.
=
I don't watch queendom but who's the girl at the beginning in the red dress and what group is she from and how does she like her eggs in the morning,noon and night
=
미친 유아 개멋있어... 진짜 잘생겼다..... 난 평생 오마이걸 처돌이로 살아야지!!!!!
우리 완두콩이 무대 다 찢었슈!!!!!!!
=
퀸덤 나온 여돌들한테 전부 입덕ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 특히 유아 컨셉 안무 다 찢어놨ㄷㅏ... 그리고 헤어랑 의상이 되게 잘 어울리는 것 같음 팔다리 길고 머리 작은데 그 장점을 더 잘 살리는듯 취향저격당해서 길게 씀 안무 박자에 땃딱 맞는 것도 너무 좋고 완전 거하게 치였어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 그리고 문별 9:28에 대열에 들어갈 때 웃는거 왜 설레나요...... 무한반복.... 나갈 수 없어.......
=
아이돌이 무용하면 자칫 잘못하면 어색해보일수 있는데 예인은 진짜 너무 잘했다 또 수진은 자신이 어떤걸 잘 할수있는지 잘 아는거 같고 너무 잘 표현했다 근데 맨발로했으면 더 좋았을것같기도 찬미는 진짜 표정이 너무 좋았고 유아는 모자쓰고 안무하는데 다른멤버들과는 다르게 파워풀한 안무인데도 너무 소화잘했고 문별은 마마무라는 보컬 실력파 그룹에 속해있어서 댄스를 잘 못보여준것 같았는데 이번에 너무 멋지게 잘보여준것 같다 특히 마지막 부채 퍼포먼스 진짜 멋있었슴
=
문별이2등된거 나만이해안되나..젤 첨에 문별파트 나올때 좀 많이지루했음 그리고 저 그룹에 안어울린다 (저 문별 좋아해요)
=
Yein can dance like that?? Its incredible. She is perfect, the choreo, the stare, the charisma. Its just too beautiful. I think she is the best here.
=
정예인 오프닝에서 씹어드시고 서수진 출격해서 무대 찢어버리고 찬미가 남자들 다 홀리자마자 유시아 그루브로 여덕들도 홀리고 문별이 원투쓰리 강냉이까지 털어버린 무대
=
THESE GIRLS PERFORMANCE JUST CALLED ME UGLY AND TALENTED IN EVERY ASPECT! DAMN IT
=
Did Soojin just have me questioning?
Yes
Did she have everyone in queendom questioning?
Yes
Does she have everyone falling for her?
HELL YES
=
유아 미쳤다 진짜 저 얼굴에 저 비율에 세상 여리여리 인형같이 생긴애가 표정 싹 바뀌어서 구두신고 춤추니까 와,, 미칠 것 같애 진짜,,,,, 오진다,, 진짜 잘춘다 진짜 멋지다 이말밖에 안 나옴,,
=
While everyone is proud with their member mamamoo is like cringing with moonbyul😂😂😂I still love any gay show moonbyul put on
=
Yein, Soojin & Yooa did NOT come to play. they all did great but these 3 just stood out to me so much
=
im mad that yein was not even in the top three performances
=
근데 퀸덤 무늬만 경연이지 순위도 별로 신경 안 쓰이고 
재밌고 그러네..
=
Who’s the first girl performing? i’m in love
Edit: thanks for the likes haha and she is Yein from lovelyz incase anybody wonders.
=
예인 무조건 상위할 줄 알았는데..
=
Moonbyul be like: no one should tell me to wear those **wears long sleeves and pants**
=
예인이 진짜 잘했눈뎅 ㅠㅠ
=
와 예인이 미쳤어... 머릿 속에서 떠나지 않아 또 보러 옴 ㅠㅠㅠ
=
예인이가 4등인게 믿을수가없네;;
=
wow yein was killing it.
=
YooA and Yein can step on me whenever they want!!!
=
예인이 때문에 다시왔다
=
OK BUT YEIN IS SO GOOD YALL
=
I keep coming back here to watch Yein's performance. I didn't know her before, learned her name from the comments. So graceful, so elegant.
=
How did Yein only rank 4th? The other girls did good too, but I thought she might win, or at least get top 3!
=
당연히 1등일줄알았던 정예인 4등 ..
1.유아 2.문별 3.수진 4.예인 5.찬미 6.은지

그리고 은지는 개인춤 나오지도 않았는데
불공평 하자낭 ㅋㅋ
=
yein you did well!!!
=
That yooa girl is so cute 😂
=
YEIN PRINCESINHA DE MAIS AAAAAA
=
YEIN SLAYED
=
I can’t believe yein is no 4 in this performance. Seems popularity is bias in this performance!
=
My ranking : 

1. YooA
2. Yein
3. Chanmi
4. Soojin 
5. Moonbyul

And I don't think it's fair to rank Eunji she deserved a solo
=
Now you guys see right? How lovelyz are being treated? They did great but yeah they are too underrated & somehow people hate them for no reason .. . We lovelinus always need to be strong for the girl.. but we know lovelyz are more suffered emotionally & mentally but they always smiles to us & make us happy by their lovely performance😔😔
=
This show Ranking is actually garbage. 
Yeein was *clearly* the best and still she ranked 4th. 
Same thing happened to Bom in Round 2, she was great yet ranked 5th
=
Yein, soojin, yooa got me here💗💗
=
Other group look proud of their member while mamamoo was like we dunno u🤣
=
9:49 omg soojin and moonbyul together 💖💖
=
Im so sad poor yein 💔No HATE BUT YEIN ARE AMAZING💔👏👏👏👏
=
The begin until end this vid make me have no words to say 

Cause
*I'M SHOOK*
=
Yessss, Soojin & Chanmi!!
Damn, that Yein girl is gorgeous
=
I'm so happy because my Lovelyz comeback 2th. Fighting!!
=
Ranking:
1st: YooA
2nd: Moonbyul
3rd: Soojin
4th: Yein
5th: Chanmi
6th: Eunji

Congrats to all the girls! They all worked extremely hard and I'm super proud they were able to create such an amazing performance!!! Regardless of the rankings they all did really well :)
=
I love how much kpop girl groups love Little Mix
=
와 스벌.... 오프닝 돌았나 ㄹㅇ 다 미친 것처럼 잘하는데 평소에 예인 저런 모습을 못 봐서 그런가 진짜 개쩌는데.. ? 몇번 돌려 봄 넘 소름 돋아서 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 아니 친절한 금자씨 브금으로 어떻게 저런 생각을 했냐 진짜 워,,,, 하나같이 끼 넘치는 거 봐서는 결론은 연옌은 진짜 아무나 하는 게 아니다.... 끼가 미쳤다. 진짜. 다들 겁내 멋있음요 ㅠㅠ!!!!
=
am i the only one who feel annoy about other's reaction?
i mean i don't mind other people's reaction, but the problem is the program showed too much.
when i started enjoy the show, the program put the emphasize on the reaction, then i heard screamed 
i just want to enjoy the show ( > < )

예인이왜안1등?ㅠ

댄싱나인?에서 유아보고 오마이걸인줄도 모르고 잘춘다 귀엽게 생겼는데 키도크고 춤 ㅎㄷㄷ 이네 했었었는데 ... 춤선 실력은  넘사벽인듯...그리고 수진? 아이들은 보는데 현아 생각남 .. 저런 분위기랑 춤동작은 타고난 끼인듯 ㅜㅠ

수진이랑 더럽게 얽히고 싶다... 수진이 내 인생을 망치러 온 구원자였으면 좋겠다... 수진... 수진... 수진...
=
너무 다들 잘했지만 매우 개인적으로 수진이랑 예인이 가장 좋았다..
수진은 퍼포먼스 적으로 표정과 압권이고
예인은 선이 너무 예뻤음
=
9:11 9:20
=
I'd totally go gay for yooa
=
퍼포먼스는 예인이 시작 때 찢어놓고 수진이는 진짜 아이돌 안 했으면 어쩔 뻔 했지 라고 생각할 만큼 끼 너무 많고 찬미는 자기 개성이랑 제일 어울리는 거 같고 유아는 색다르고 춤선 너무 멋지고 문별은 부채 퍼포먼스랑 팝핀 지려따ㄷㄷㄷ
=
아니 정예인이 이정도로 예쁘고 이런 다양한 스타일의 무대가 잘어울린다는걸 지금 알았단데 한이다 한.. 친절한 금자씨도 진짜 소름돋았는데 8:57분 진짜 보다 헉 했음 넘 예뻐서ㅠㅠㅠ
=
예인아....언니가 제일 좋아하는 영화 친절한금자씨 작품 해줘서 고마워....러블리너스로서 아니 사람으로서 고마워...개인적으로 친절한 금자씨 최애 영화인데 예인아...넌 쩔었어..
=
IM SO HAPPY THEY DID TWO LITTLE MIX SONGS
=
유아는 진짜 못하는 게 없구나ㅠㅠ 펑퍼짐한 옷을 입어도 감출 수 없는 춤선.. 유시아가 다 해먹었다 ㅠㅠ!!!!!
=
not a fan but yein and yooa KILLED IT
=
정예인 이정도로 잘하는줄몰랐어.. ....초반에 컨셉이랑 연기 춤선 다 씹어먹었네....... ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠ 이런것좀 자주시켜줘라 소속사야. .
=
Can someone please tell me their names??? They're so talented 😍😍
=
친절한 금자씨가 나올 줄은 진짜 상상도 못했다 오프닝 때 소름 돋음
=
YASSSS SHOW THE WORLD THAT GIRLS POWER IS THE BEST
=
Yein's dance was so charismatic and elegant  and her expression were great😍
=
Soojin's mode:
Shy soojin = off
Sexy soojin = *ON*
=
왜 은지는 개인무대없지.. 좀 불공평한거아닌가. 글고 반응좀 애지간히 섞어야지 본방보는데 짜증남 무대좀보고싶은데 계속 악지르는거만나와
=
idk her name but AOA girl killed it, like all aoa stages had been superior
=
I LITERALLY COULDN'T BREATHE WHEN SOOJIN CAME IC ZNAT SNSUEL0 ME I CANT BRATHE SHE DI BD
=
왜 이렇게 눈만 시뻘겋게 하고 다녀?
친절하게 보일까봐 에서부터 전 이미 죽었습니다
=
유아 진짜 미쳤나요 의자 딱 돌리고 현실로 감탄 나옴 ㅅㅂ 오..... 마이갓........
=
근데 솔라씨는 진짜 이 프로그램 애청자네 표정잌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Where moomoo,  back up moonbyul please
=
예인 첫무대도 임팩트지만.. 단체곡에서도 꽤 돋보였음
한때 칼군무 울림이었다는걸 생각하게 되었음
=
*SOOJIN?!*
=
친절한 금자씨 선곡 너무 좋잖아...... 진짜 1도 안흔하고 신선하다...... 너무 멋지고 임팩트 남아도 흔하게 쓰이는 곡이나 구성이 있는법인데 예인 무대는 정말 신선 그자체 기억에 빡남는다고..
=
THE GAYS ARE HAPPY
=
개인적으로 정예인이랑 유시아가 제일 잘한 것 같다...
정예인은 현대무용 전공해서 그런지 춤선 개쩔고 연기도 잘함...
그리고 박자 맞춰서 춤출 때마다 겁나 소름임
유시아는 진짜 개멋졌음..
원래 마잭 춤하면 마잭이랑 비교되는데
모자 큰 거 써서 작은 얼굴 다 가렸으면서 입술로만 봐도 레알 쩐다..
한국 댓글 없어서 못 적었었는데 좀 보여서 적어봐요 ㅎㅎ
=
Elegant Jung Yein
=
다들 너무 잘했지만 아직까지도 여운이 남는건 예인 친절한 금자씨.. 너무 잘함
=
Yein 4th ?????
=
I heard that yein cried a lot because of this stage. She was scared and nervous that she might make a mistake. It's okay, not everyone is perfect ❤
=
sad how the first girl in red Dress, Yein, only ranked 4th hmmmmfffff
=
Yein's performance is art, not just a dance stage
=
This performance proved what Yooa said that she can dance to any kind of dance.
=
예인이 처음 스타트 너무 잘 해줌ㄷㄷ그리고 유아에서 너무 멋있어지고 다같이 파워할때 무대가 꽉참
=
still angry about Chanmi didn't get any shot when she was the center on chorus
=
춤의 정확성이랑 박자를 제일 잘맞추는건 유아고.. 표정이 압권인건..찬미랑 수진...
=
Since that episode of Queendom, I come here often to watch Yein's performance... Just WOW
=
다들 멋있었지만 유아씨가 놀라웠다 마이클잭슨 춤을 저렇게 완벽하게 소화하다니   평소 무대의 청순하고 아름답고 유려한 이미지였는데 와
=
Yein did so well!! she's so elegant i'm in awe
=
It's weird how all of this girls are so girly and everything, and then there's Moonbyul looking so manly around them 😂❤️
=
YEIN RANKED 4TH FOR THIS PERFORMANCE?? 
this is honestly so biased 😭😭
=
처음에 빨간옷 예인맞죠?얼굴만이쁜줄알았는데 춤도너무잘추네
=
Love Yein
=
이거보거 예인이 한테 반함💖💖💖
=
everyone is in love with soojin, am i right?
=
이거 팩튼데 개인무대고 단체무대고 정예인이 젤 잘함 ㅈㄴ 압도적이고 표정연기고 춤선이고 말할것도 없이 너무 잘해버림ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ울 막내 체고야💗💗💗💗 오늘도 퀸덤 본방사수‼️ 정예인이 다했다ㅠㅠ
=

=
wow 😮everybodys dancing was very well done and performed moonbyul can dance very well 🔥🔥
=
They're use 2 Little mix songs 🔥🔥🔥
=
Omg I love hyejeong's reactions sm 😂😂❤
=
유아 마무리하고 손가락 덜덜 떨리는게 보인다.. 그룹에서 하늘하늘보다 마이클잭슨을 더 좋아한다더니 하고싶은 무대를 하느라 많이 긴장했나보다. 충분히 잘했고 유아라는 사람을 알았으며 매력발산 잘 보았다 :)
=
Power by Little Mix is one of my absolute favorite songs by them and when I heard the bike part I thought it was something else and when I heard Power I screamed.Oh my god they all did such an AMAZING job😭😭💘
=
WOW Lovelyz and Oh my girl
=
와 진짜 예인 친절한 금자씨 개미쳤.. 다른 사람들도 잘했지만 진짜 무대를 발라버렸네.. 진짜 대사 나올때부터 소름.. strip도 마지막에 딱 맞는거 쾌감 쩔
=
이 영상은 예인보러 들어온다
=
정예인 춤선 미쳤고 수진 낯가림 심하던 애가 셔츠 풀어헤칠때 미쳤고 찬미 처음 등장에 표정 미쳤고ㅜㅜ유아 문별 말해뭐해ㅜㅜㅜ이 둘은 그냥 미쳤어ㅜㅜ 은지님 개인무대 없는게 아쉽지만 그래도 열심히 해주셔서 감사할따름
=
서수진 당신 ............ 진짜 미쳤어....... 옷 찢을 때 나도 같이 찢어놨어ㅏ...........
=
친절한 예인씨,,, 영상 뜬 후로 만날 보러 오는듯 무대가 그냥 날 치고 갔다 대사치는 것부터 후 부는 것까지.....ㅠㅡㅠ💖💖
=
1일1예인찍는중
=
I'M ALWAYS COMING BACK FOR CHANMI!!!! CHANMI SLAY!!!!
=
아이돌이 더이상 이전의 '아이돌' 수준이 아니라 '아티스트'라는 것을 확실히 느낄수 있었다. 최고다 다들!!
=
My nth time watching hahaha, soo addicting
=
I really love Monbyul's swag!!!!!!!!
=
All I Can Say Please Stop Cyber Bullying to IDOLS they work hard to gain and improve their talents. If you hate any lovelyz members please just keep it to yourself, it's not helping for them. Is it hard to be good to others ? Grow up guys/peoples/Knetz and International Fans.
=
5:58 리얼 절친이 아니면 할 수 없는 리액션 ㅋㅋㅋ

=
어떻게 점점 갈수록 멋진무대가돼가냐.....
=
미라클인데 문별언니 씩 웃는 거 보고 심장 저격 당했다... 진짜 왤케 멋져 ㅈㄴ 떨리네

=
수진 너무섹시
=
와 문별아 잘생겼다
=
개인포퍼먼스 무용 배워서 그런지 춤선이 ㄷㄷ하네 정예인 미쳤나봐 너무 이뻐 데뷔 초창기때는 귀여웠는데 성숙미 미쳤네 19~20때부터 얼굴이 달라짐 단체 포퍼먼스할때도 분위기 갑 문별 춤도 레전더리 다른 분들도 매우 잘하심 굳굳
=
Soojin unzip her cloth

Shuhua: She’s crazyyy 😂

Don’t sleep on my girl chanmi, she slayed a lot❤️
=
The first one is so impressive
=
others: *male backup dancer*
soojin: *gay rights*
=
메인댄서인 미주, 지수가 아닌 왜 예인이가 러블리즈 퍼포먼스 대표로 나왔는지 알겠다... 예인아... 진짜 오늘 한번 더 너에게 반하고 간다... 엉엉
=
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO TURNED GAY FOR SOOJIN
=
오프닝 친절한 금자씨 대사 넣을 생각을 어떻게했지..? 대단하다 오프닝이 찢었다 먼저 ㄷㄷ 이건
=
4:37 who is she? she is so talented :(
=
춤알못이라 춤은 모르겠고 수진 표정이 진짜 후덜덜이네 신인인데 대단하다
=
I love Moonbyul
=
유아가 마이클잭슨 퍼포먼스를 할거라곤 상상도 못했다 동작 크고 선이쁜줄만 알았는데 의외였고 너무 잘해서 개인적으로 제일 신선했음
=
YEIN the queen of contemporary dance
=
유아 컨셉 좋당 예인이랑 수진도 진짜 잘했넹
=
아니 이게 무슨일이야 진짜 미쳤다 정말,, 다들 왜이렇게 잘해요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 예인도 친절한 금자씨 너무 잘 소화하고 수진은 넘 고혹적,, 코피 터짐ㅜ 찬미는 파워풀하게 잘했음 떨어질때 후달달,,, 유아는 뭐 말할것도없음 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 발재간 대박임 문별도 잘했다ㅠ
=
러블리즈 얘네는 흩어져야 강하네
=
mnet should make for boygroups too!!
=
Soojin was like: I will let you guys know what sexy is
=
I really wish Soojin and Han Seung Woo can perform together. Both of them really go from SHY to SLAY when performing especially sexy concepts *U Got It *
=
they're all good but honestly Yein killed everything ... she's awesome + she looks ethereal specially on the first part
=
I'm a professional dancer, here is how I would rank them:

1) Yein (Lovelyz) - That was some amazing technique and kick ass choreography
2) YooA (Oh My Girl) - Channeling Michael Jackson is hard and she did a pretty good job of it, points off for cheating on the lean though ...
3) Moonbyul (Mamamoo) - Simple choreo, but she did it well
4) Soojin (G-IDLE) - Technique was solid if not amazing, seemed to overly rely on sexyness
5) Chanmi (AOA) - Choreo was decent but technique was a little lacking, her movement isn't sharp enough.

I feel if it really were about the dancing, the ranking would have been similar to this, but its also a popularity contest, which is a shame.
=
wait, can someone tell me their ranks??
=
Wait no one is talking about chanmi??? Seriously???
=
와 예인 ㄹㅇ 충격 선곡 씹상타치고 대사친 것도 대박
=
예인이 홀린듯이 보다가 마지막에 독침쐇어 와 정신못차리겠네,,
=
예인이 식스센스에서 데이고서 선곡에 신경쓰며 완전 충격을 줄 곡을 선택한 듯 진짜 완벽
=
soojin being the hottest girl that she is 🔥
=
와 진짜 한명한명 다들 너무 잘했는데 예인 기억에 계속 남고 수진 찬미 문별 다들 너무 멋있고 유아 최애 될것같고 단체 진짜 미쳤다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 중간에 나온 남자분처럼 내 머리 뜯을뻔했음ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ와 진짜
=
Dancing is in the genes of YooA. She's born with it running in her blood.
=
Soojin's facial expression is always on point.
=
I have no idea about the opening girl but i was surprised by the opening dance!
It was amazing!
=
The girl in the beginning was on fire. 🔥
=
soojin and the Dancer did it for the gays, and only for them, fight me
=
예인이 준비할때 힘들어서 맨날 울었다던데 괜한 걱정한듯
=
예인은 부드럽고 찬미는 파워풀하고 유아는 가볍고 다들 춤을 잘추는데 다 느낌이 다르다는게 신기하네요. 목소리 음색만큼이나 춤스타일이 많은것같단 생각을 하게하는 무대입니다
=
Yein literally KILLED IT!!🔥
=
예인이가 러블리즈를 살렸다.
=
다보고 기억에 남는사람은 예인밖에 없는거같다.. 잘하기도 했구 파트너랑 호흡이 넘 잘맞았다 ㅠㅠ 남자 댄서가 넘 서포트 잘해줬음 ㅠ
=
Who is the first girl and song name ???
=
hey I'm the comment that appreciates Moonbyuls performance and that you was searching for. She killed it and I hope she takes the first place... she performed her own beautiful and deep song, proofed haters wrong who said mamamoo can't dance and snatched my wig.
=
YooA and Yein!!!
=
Who's the first girl?
=
For the solo stages, I think Yein and YooA stand out the most ❤️❤️ btw I really proud of these girls. Who said Kpop girls are not talented ? give them watch this.
=
10:33
Itzy : *am I a joke to you?*
=
Chan mi ♥♥
=
Not @ how Eunjis jacket is lying on the floor the whole performance 😭
=
서수진 진짜 미쳤어 ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 단체도 무대를 걍 찢었다 이거야 ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
=
2:56
Hahahahaha
=
They were all perfect! Lia Kim did an amazing job with that song. Let's give some props to the behemoth choreographer that is Lia freaking Kim
=
4:47 유아의 스웩(?)에 반한 오마이걸ㅋㅋㅋ
=
No lie I did not even know yooa when I saw this.   But after I saw her dance to smooth criminal she was definitely the best one the other girls were amazing too but man she stuck out. And she killed the main group dance too .  I'm so glad I saw this cause now I have another girl group to  Check out, oh my girl!
=
유아가 기본기가 진짜 오짐 진짜..
=
YooA is a smooth criminal. She pulled out a classic.
=
하ㅏㅏ이아아아아ㅏ아아아아아아아씨발ㅇ어ㅜㅠㅠ유ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜ시ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠ아ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅠㅠㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
That's my bias SOOJIN 'ya all !!
=
About time these individual talent sine through! So happy for Chanmin and YooA the most! Don't get me wrong, the other girls killed it but YooA can do so much more, look at her dance skills which are underrated and Chanmin, her rap and vocals were showcased through out the whole show, now her dance! Literally so happy! Look at their members reaction. They know that they were made for more. Oh My Girls' standing ovation and the AOA girls so proud of their maknae.
=
진짜 걸그룹 대 화합의 장이다 너무좋아 이런무대 맨날 해주세요
=
8:49

=
정예인  이번 무댄 정말좋은듯... 식센땐 얜 또뭐냐 했는데 식센 악몽을 찢고  무대를 했다는거.. 이번 무대는 성공이넴
=
Moonbyul smiling literally killed me!! 언니 너무 멋있어 😍😍💯💯

Soojin!  😭😍💖💖

Moon is now creating a new boy group.

THE BEST PERFORMANCE EVER ON THIS PLANET FIGHT ME IF YOU WANT
=
5:15 the foot steps 😳😳😵
=
(G)idle fire 12m most views in queendom, and Soojin fancam señorita 1m supere other candidates, the power
=
예인 대박 !!!!!
=
Go watch all the fancam and you guys will know who had the best performance. Not a fan but I think yooa is the best here. Even though her solo stage is quite short and the cameraman didn’t focus on her much, she slays the stage and did so damn good. Her movements were amazing as well. You MUST go watch her fancam and you will have no regret
=
연습 및 성과는 찬미 한표!
1등은 러블.. or 오마... or 아이... 헿헤헤
=
유아언니 .... ㅉ ㅏ릿해

=
freaking love byul
=
와우 진짜 다들 포스가 장난 아니에요 ㄷㄷㄷ...
예인 언니는 원래도 예쁜데 더 예쁜 것 같고 수진 언니는 진짜 입이 떡 벌어지는 섹시였고
AOA 찬미 언니는 멋짐 + 섹시의 교과서 같은 느낌이었고 
이 중 제 최애 유아 언니는 유아의 아련함 같은 건 벗어던지고 마이클 잭슨이 되어 엄청난 포스와 멋짐을 보여주셨고
마지막 문별 언니는 원래도 멋있는데 퀸덤 할 때마다 더 멋있어지는 것 같고  ❤️
이런 프로그램 자주해서 멋진 무대 자주 볼수 있으면 좋겠어요 ㅠㅠ
아이돌 분들은 주로 그룹 컨셉을 잡고 활동하니 자신 만의 숨은 매력을 보여주기 어려운 거 같아요 ㅜㅜ
다들 이렇게 멋있는데... 진짜 콘서트 하나 보고 온 기분입니다^^
=
나만 문별 춤이 좀 아쉬웠나 ㅠ 더 잘할 수 있었을 것 같은데 댄서와 합이 맞지 않고 음악이랑 춤이 좀 뜨는 느낌이 드는데 ㅜ 눈빛은 진짜 멋진데 그게 좀 아쉬움 ㅠ
=
Anyone know what’s the first song that  Yein danced to? I’m trying to find out the title in English
=
아니 근데 찬미 언니 너무 잘하지 않아????????? 언니 나 방금 태어났어 아 원래 언니라고???
=
That boy at 10:20 be like: *wig snatched*
=
Why isn’t anybody talking about our King Moonbyul?? She killed the stage along with all the other girls😉❤️
=
문별.. 당신 너무 설레게 생겼어
=
At 1:08 the guy accidentally hits his head really hard! The guy played it off like a champ though lmaoooo
=
영국 언어로 인해 사라진 언어가 몇개더라?
=
수..수진아...?
=
사랑해 서수진
=
Eunji ❤
=
수진 직캠 좀 풀어주샘
=
수진진짜 내 마음속의 원픽
=
CHANMI AND SOOJIN SLAYED!!!!
=
3:24
=
유아의 그 귀여운 얼굴을 모자로 가리고 춘 건 
신의 한수였다.
=
그와중에 보수적인 슈화씨
=
진심 캠 발캠이지만 문별이 웃는거 찍은사람 칭찬해
=
와 문별 개 쩔 어
=
퀸덤 7회는 퍼포먼스조가 살렸다고 보여질정도로 빠져들었음 다른생각은 할수없을정도로 입벌리고 집중해서 시간이 금세 가버림, 보컬조의 곡들은 전체적으로 루즈한느낌이여서 뭔가 다채로운 구성의 아쉬움이 느껴졌었음, 그룹본무대(3번째무대 8화예고)가 있으니 최대한 부담없는 곡을 선택한 느낌이라 이해는 하지만 보컬쪽은 솔직한 평가로 크게 와다은 무대는 없었습니다
=
With Moonbyul's girl crush aura, I just love seeing her dance in girly genre plus those smilesss!! 😍😍
=
정예인 진짜 너무잘햇고 이번무대에서 잘보인다
=
Moon is now my ideal husband.
=
친절해 보일까 봐 첫 부분부터 지리는데요???????????퀸덤 미쳤다..... 온몸에 소름 돋아 다 잘해 나 음악이 잠시 끊기고 강한 전율로 딱 바뀔 때 마치 내가 주인공이 된 마냥 몰입해서 소름 돋아서 좋아
=
YOOA YOU SLAYED IT💞😍 Also Soojin
=
yung mga nag dislike mga hater amp!
=
Soojin another lv
=
Chanmi 💜
=
얘들모야~ 왜 다 잘하지?? 왜 그룹에 있음 못하지??
=
솔직히 문별 자기 잘생긴거 알고있을거야... 웃을때마다 심장 진짜 존나게 치이는데 저거 다 알고 웃는걸거야.. 문별때문에 몇번은 돌려봄 잘생겼는데 뭐랄까 춤도 잘생겼어...
=
i need yein in isac gymnastics
=
개인적으로 정예인이 퍼포먼스에서 제일 눈에 띄었다.. 팬심 다 떠나고 진짜 10분 다 끝나고 정예인이 대사 따라한거가 제일 기억남음..
=
서수진 유시아 표정 미쳤다 이 무대를 찢어놓으셨다 역시 확신의 최애픽...서수진 찌푸리는 표정 지을때마다 인구 절반이 줄어들어요 와중에 예슈화 서수진이 셔츠 열때 리액션 내조하는 사람 같아서 너무 웃김ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
수진이 진짜 미쳐씀 아이돌 안했으면 큰일날뻔
=
찬미 개 잘함 ; 근데 은지라는 분 카메라 진짜 안잡아주시네
=
유닛은 핑계고 개인무대하려고 짠 팀같음..
=
다 너무 잘했는데 솔직히 이번거는
예인이랑 유아가 너무 잘했다.. 압도적이야...
유아 마이클잭슨 포스  지려버렸고...
예인이 식스센스의 악몽을 잊고
첫빠부터 진짜 무대를 찢어놨네 ...
=
Yein 💛💛💛💛😭😭😭😭😭😭
=
Soojin ☺👑
=
how is no one talking about YooA's performance? her dancing is literally on a whole other level omg
=
진짜 객관적으로 보면 예인이가 무대를 부악부루ㄹ롹 찢어놓은듯 그리고 수진이랑 유아무대가 기억에 남는다
=
다 잘추고 다이쁜데 제일 반전이고 기억에 남는건 맨처음인데도 불구하고 정예인이 짱인듯..선곡도 춤선 대박
=
왁킹부분은 유아만 맞아서 아예 비춰주지도 않은건가
=
아니 예인이 진짜 미쳤는데? 너무 잘해서 소름돋음
=
개인무대는 막상막하고 단체는 유아가 씹어먹음 왁킹 혼자 다 하는거 부터일단..그리고 유아 혼자 박자늦단 말있던데 나머지가 다 박자 빠른거임 단체직캠보고와라
=
정예인 서수진 최고,,, 진짜... 분위기 압살....... 레드랑 너무 잘어울린다
=
Yein and Yooa OMG, only this, OH MY GOD.
=
LOVELYZ Yein and (G)-IDLE Soojin are both slayed!!! Ma Girls be like: Get out my way you blind!!.


Edit: ALL THE GIRLS ARE SLAYING!! MY EYES ARE BLESSED  ❤️
=
Moonbyul just murdered every women and men equally lol
=
Who just knew Yein but liked her performance?? Rise your hand🙆🙆
=
예인 개쩐다 다들 잘했지만 첫순서인데도 유일하게 끝날때까지 선명하게 기억에 남음
=
JUNG YEIN totally killed it
=
Yein killed it wow
=
Yein 😊
=
Yein's intro is iconic
=
the last part was like they're doing the position of dalla dalla but with slayed idols.
=
yein: donghae oppa watch me😂😍😍
=
Everyone go watch yooa's smooth criminal fancam just once, you can thank me later <3
=
I seriously love the girl with red in her outfit!!
=
I really love Soojin's and Yooa's performance here 💖
=
Also i'm happy that Soojin gave us more Tango dancing since she do it really well and is not a genre that many idols dance
=
러블리즈가 1차 2차 때 청순 컨셉 벗어나고 싶어했던 이유가 있었네...충분히 그럴 포텐이 있었던건데 선곡이랑 편곡을 잘못해갖고 청순만 해야한다고 욕먹었네ㅜㅜㅜㅜ 이번에는 케이, 정예인 다 잘해서 잘될듯
=
Soojin is indeed hyuna's daughter
=
Chanmi's performance screams experience! 😍 Love all of the performance
=
Yooa moves as light as a feather! Definitely gave the most precise and fluid performance. Go check out the full fancam guys! ❤️
=
OMG YOOA WAS PERFECT!!!
=
Soojin did great y'all... that facial expression lit!!🔥🔥
=
5:56 is gonna be the best reaction HAHAHA
=
Wheein should have danced also. She's so good!
=
1.50 hyejong "oh yeahh~~" 😆
=
Damn, I'm so in love with moonbyul 😍😍😍😍😍
=
진짜 누가 1위해도 이상하지 않을 역대급 무대였음
=
M-O-O-N-B-Y-U-L❤️❤️❤️❤️
=

=
The white face make up, don't know what's it called, add points on the Smooth Criminal. LOL
=
So proud of Eunji! Thank you for being there for our Queen Bom! 😚😭
=
와 예인이 무대 찢었다 ㅠ ㅠ ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ 퀸덤 안나왔으면 어쩔뻔
=
Ugh I just want one version  without all the breaks for reaction!!!! It interrupts  the amazingness  of the stage!!!
=
10:19 This guy was like
*OW MY GHAWD THIS IS SO GREAT OH CRAP WHERES MY WIG- OH HERE IT IS*
=
I just feel Junsun's flow in YooA so powerful.
=
The first girl was so good! The rest were typical.
=
sojin had me shock omg she is badass
=
Mamamoo❤️❤️❤️
=

=
queendom already made a subunit. gosh! this is crazy. i love them. i said. I LOOOOOOOOVEEE THEEEEMMM.

=
SOOOOOOOOOJIIINNNNNN!!!! CHAAAAAANMIIIIIIIIII!
=
OMG

=
대한민국 여자들 심장 조져놓는 서수진 최고
=
2:15 조명 파란색으로 확 바뀌는 거 너무 좋다
=
왜 울 *서수진* 언급은 없낭 개잘했는데♡
=
문별 진짜 본새난다 개멋져....
=
3차경연은 아무리봐도 러블리즈가 다 먹었는데;;
=
친절한 예인씨 ㄷㄷ
=
Moon I lo ve you!! You are my queen
=
*THIS SHOW IS DEFINITELY FOR GIRL CRUSH STANS*
=

=

=
Moonbyul Queen!
=
*무대는 완벽했다. 하지만 카메라가 문제이다.*
=
I LOVE THIIIIIIS ❤
=
*is looking to see if she twerked*
*blinks* no!
=
MOONBYUL OPPA!!!! 😍
=
찬미찡❤️ ㅜㅡ
=
별아ㅠㅜ문별이가 문별이 했고 나 진짜 울어ㅠㅜ
=
6Puzzle I'm so proud of you!!!!!! You all did great!!
=
수진언냐... 퍼포먼스 할 때 얼굴도... 보고싶었는데... 조명이💖💖
=
문별 부터 보이네
=
욕 먹어가는 러블리즈 막내 정예인이 살렸다는 말 밖에 안 나온다
=
10분20초 남성분 곧 너무 좋아서 날아가시겠는걸 ..
=
AOA debuted in 2012.. no wonder Chanmi is this good. also, other performers played their part very well. Chanmi and Soojin are my favorite parts.
=
Soojin hot dayum! Hope there's no kids in the audience!
=
Nobody gonna talk about Chanmi??
=
예인의 재발견 진짜 짱이다
=
마무리 동작 잇지 노래 마무리 아님? ㅋㅋㅌㅋㅋ킄
=
Girl’s power
=
MOONBYUUUUUUULLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=

10:22
=
Sans voix🤯💘💘💘💘💘💘🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
=
예인 미쳤다.. 표정까지 갓벽 와..
=
Moonbyul me hizo un amarre
=
와.. 예인 진짜 저런 재능이 있을줄은..감탄함
=
Chanmi was so powerful
=
진짜 유아 등장할 때 유아회장님한테 서류더미로 맞고싶었다고요ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅠㅜㅜㅜㅠㅜ
=
Little mix yessss
=
Yein,Soojin,Chanmi,YooA: Lets Steal their boys.
MoonByul: Okay, I steal their Girls... 

🤭🤭🤭
=
I can't get over aoa fangirling over all of them
=
예인 퍼포먼스가 진짜 오졌는데 유아가 춤선이 진짜 대박 완죤 잘춤 근데 ㅅ수진이 표정이 날 주겻다.
=
정예인 친절한금자씨 전설은 아니고 레전드다 진짜..
무대 다보고나서 가장 기억에 남는 무대
현대무용 해서 그런지 춤선도 너무 예쁨
진짜로 무대를 찢어놨음
=
예인님은 무용을 햇엇다는건 알앗지만 이렇게 임팩트 잇는 무대를 보여줄 수 있는 능력이 잇는지는 몰랏다...대단쓰..
수진님은 수퍼섹시 무대를 보였는데 자신이 무대에서 얼마나 섹시하게 보이는지를 잘 인지 하는거 같은 느낌...대단쓰..
유아님은 강약조절을 빡!! 절제를 빡!! 길쭉 길쭉한 팔 다리가 다 보였어. 둔해 보이지않고 날렵하게. 마이클 잭슨 커버는 그동안 엄청나게 봣엇지만. 유아님 최고다. 정말 잘햇다... 대단쓰..
=
수진 표현력에 있어서는 진짜 탑클래스인듯.  저런 표정과 느낌, 진짜 타고난 끼가 없이는 안됨.
=
muli famdoms are *shaking*
=
찬미 예인 재발견..찬미 진짜 장난아니다 ㅜㅜ 맨날 멤버들 가려져서 잘안보였는데 여기서 실력 제대로 보여주는듯
=
개인적으로 예인님 무대가 가장 인상적이고  잘 한 거 같음 물론 다들 잘 하셨는데 곡 선정과 안무 너무 잘 짜신 거 같고 표정연기가지 대박임 뭔가 기괴함?같은 게 느껴짐 소름돋음
=
예인 표정에 대해 의아하신 분이 있어서 제가 쓴 해석글 남겨요!
친절한 금자씨라는 영화에서 금자인 이영애가 청소년 때 원치 않는 임신을 했고 평소 의지했던 백선생님에게 도와달라고 찾아감. 근데 백선생은 어떤 아이를 유괴해서 죽인 사건이 있었고 이것을 빌미로  너가 한 일이라 거짓말 증언을 하지 않는다면 이영애의 딸을 위협한다고 했음. 이영애는 예쁜 얼굴에 어울리지 않는 유괴사건으로 뉴스에도 나왔고 감옥에서 13년 동안 옥살이를 함. 이영애는 이 사건 이후로 감옥에서 세상 착한 '코스프레'를 하기 시작함. 그렇게 한 결과 기독교의 절실한 신자로서 다른 교도소 사람들에게 세상에서 가장 친절하다는 말을 듣고 모두의 환대를 받으며 출소 했지만 사실 이영애는 13년동안 백선생에게 할 복수를 위해 교도소 사람들과 백선생의아내에게 계획적으로 도움을 주고 은인이 되어 이를 이용해 백선생을 죽이려고 이를 갈고 있었던 것... 나오자 마자 그녀의 본색은 다시 나타났고 눈에 빨간 섀도를 칠하며 이제는 안 칠절한 모습을 보여주고 수시로 백선생을 죽이는 꿈을 꾸기도 함. 그렇게 백선생에게 할 복수를 위해 그를 납치해 총을 겨눴지만, 백선생은 그 이후 더 많은 유괴살인을 저질렀다고 고함....이영애의 선택이 다른 아이들의 희생을 더 만들었다는 죄책감에 그 자리를 떠났고, 경찰에게ㅜ도움을 요청하기도 함. 그녀는 13년만의 복수가 고작 백선생을 죽이는 것으로 끝내는 것에 대한 허탈감을 느낀 기분이었을 것이라고 추정함. 결국 이영애는 백선생을 죽임. 예인이 "왜 이렇게 눈만 시뻘겋게 칠해요" "친절해보일까봐" 라고 대답한 것은 친절함 그 반대의 얘기였죠... 그 다음은 예인이 댄서(백선생)와 같은 동작으로 휘둘리는 장면이 나오고 예인이 땅을 구르는 등 괴로움을 느낌. 결국 예인은 백선생을 처단하고 홀로 터덜터덜 걸어오며 웃는 모습은 친절해보이는 척을 했을때를 표현하고 나중에 얼굴에 손을 얹고 촛불을 분 뒤 냉소적인 표정을 지은 것은 그녀의 본색을 뜻 함. 이영애 방의 상징인  촛불은 무엇인가를 바랄 때 마치 생일케이크 처럼 불음. 예인은 사회의 선이라고 여겨지는 친절한 척을 연기했고 마침내 촛불을 분 뒤 백선생을 죽여 내가 생각하는 자신의 선인 '복수'를 이루기 위해  소원을 빌어 가면을 벗고 자신의 원래모습인 냉소적인 모습을 보여준 것임. 이것은 타인을 미워하지 말고 모두사랑하라는 성경과는 180도 다른 모습 이고, 아영애는 법적으로 처리할 수 없기에 자신만의 선이 복수였음을 의미함. 예인의 무대는 다양한 방안으로 해석될 수 있음. 이해됐길 바라며 러블리너스는 갑니다.(쓰느라 힘들었어요ㅠㅠㅠ)
=
Yein’s performance is so beautiful💖
=
친절한 금자씨 진짜 신박하고 너무 잘했어 앞에 대사넣은 것부터 소름돋았어 예인이 최고다 날 가져줘ㅠ
=
솔직히 여기선 진짜 예인 넘사다. 너무 압도적인 인상을 남김. 구성도 좋았고, 표정은 좀 아쉬웠지만 그럼에도 가장 1등감같음. 단체에서도 센터에서 딱 넘 예쁘고, 옷도 깔끔하고 잘 보이게 입은듯.
=
Yooa is the only one on beat at the beginning of power😂😂
=
I really like yeein movement. So elegant and beautiful
=
Yein is the best.. I love you girl. You did well

In the movie " Sympathy for lady vengeance", Lee Young-ae, geum-ja, seeks help from Baek, who had unwanted pregnancies and usually relied on her. However, Mr. Baek kidnapped and killed a child and told you that he threatened Lee's daughter if you didn't tell a lie because you did it. Lee Young-ae has been on the news for a kidnapping case that doesn't suit her pretty face and spent 13 years in jail. Lee Young-ae started playing the good "cosplay" in prison after this incident. As a result, she was released from prison after being told by other prison people that she was the kindest person in the world, but in fact for 13 years, Lee was intentionally helping the prison people and Baek's wife to use it as a benefactor to kill her. As soon as she came out, her true colors reappeared, and she painted red shadows on her eyes, showing no signs of shame anymore, and dreaming of killing her frequently. So he kidnapped him to fight for revenge against Mr. Baek, but he has since committed more kidnappings....He left the scene feeling guilty that Lee's choice made more sacrifices for other children, and asked for help from the police. She assumed that she felt despondent about having revenge in 13 years ended only with killing Baek. In the end, Lee Young-ae kills Baek. It was the opposite of kindness that Ye-in said, "Why do you paint your eyes so badly?" and "Maybe you look friendly." Next, there is a scene in which Ye-in is being swayed by the same movements as the dancer (Mr. Baek), and Ye-in is rolling the ground, feeling the pain. After all, Ye-In's laugh as she walks alone after killing her teacher, expresses when she pretends to be kind, and later puts her hands on her face and opens a candle, and makes a cynical face, which means her true colors. Candlelight, the symbol of Lee's room, is like a birthday cake. Ye-in played a kind gesture, which is considered a good thing in society, and she finally lit a candle and killed Baek, who took off her mask to achieve what she thought was her own good, revenge, and showed This is 180 degrees different from the Bible that says, "Don't hate others, love everyone." This means that your own good was revenge because you can't legally handle it. Ye-in's stage can be interpreted in a variety of ways I hope you understand. The Lovelinus are going. (It's been hard writing.ᅲᅲᅲ)
The stage of Ye-in can be interpreted in many ways. Please understand. Rublin's on his way (It was a difficult piece of writing.Ye-In likes it a lot. It's a little awkward to turn the translator around!^^
=
my yein!<3
=
I keep repeating yein part 😍
=
모든 걸그룹 멤버들이 다 이렇게 어마어마한 기량을 가지고 있는데 정식으로 보여줄 기회가 지금까지 없었다는 건 말도 안된다고 생각하고••• 퀸덤으로 걸그룹들이 저평가 당하는 일 없이 더 다양한 컨셉으로 더 승승장구했으면 좋겠다
=
정예인 진짜 너무 잘해서 놀랐고 울 찬미 역시 울찬미,,, 무대를 찢으셨다 진짜 테이블에서 뛰어내리는 동작에서 다칠까봐 마음 조리며 봤는 데 너 무 잘해서 다행이구 은지만 개인무대 없는 거 너무 불공평한 거 아닌가,, 힝구 기대했는데 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
=
i really love Yein and Chanmi 's performance~~~ 😍😍😍
=
The 1st performance is so beautiful 👏
=
Yein 😍
=
이번 무대가 예인 언니 레전드 무대임 ㄹㅇ '진짜 어떻게 춤선이 저렇게 예쁠 수 있는건지 하ㅠㅠㅠㅠ 마지막에 두 손 치우면서 후 하는데 언니 얼굴이 그저 빛⚡️ 앞으로 남은 무대 ㄱ대하게 되는 무대였어요ㅠㅠ 언니 사랑해요ㅜㅜ❤️❤️
=
예인 소진 찬미 유아 다 잘춘다 평소에 춤 잘춘다고 생각했던 사람들이 그룹 대표로 나왔네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
6:00 I love how they translated soft version what SeungHee said but that definitely isn't what she said! 🤣
=
2:55 Shuhua is such a dork..🤣😂
=
I was here for moonbyul because shes the only one ik but i ended up liking this full on concert
=
YooA's outfit looks so cool
=
"친절해 보일까봐" 하고 친절한 금자씨 OST 나오는순간 소름이 쫙 돋았다
=
10:19 - that fanboy was so blown away by the performance that he had to make sure his head is still in its place hahah
=
4:32 Smooth Criminal
自分用
=
My boss YooA 🔥
=
Yooa killed it🔥
=
i came to watch bc i love little mix, mamamoo, dance, and am a casual fan of gidle and aoa. i got GOOSEBUMPS !!!! these women are all so versatile and strong in their performances, and the ending with power was fantastic i teared up... i came for moonbyul and soojin and chanmi, and now i have to start loving and appreciating yooa and yein too holy fuck.
=

=

=
솔라 표정 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ개웃겨 ㅋㅋㅋ계속ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
=
Soojin killed it 🔪❤ damn girl you are so hot🔥🔥 🤤🤤💜❤
=
I'm always SHOOK when I see Soojin dancing. She's amazing.
=
it would be nice if the performance went on without showing the reaction of the audience 🤔
just sayin
=
omg how can soojin be so special 😍
=
Soojin so hot🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
=
와..진짜 금자씨 너무 감명깊어..
=
Chanmi AOA really did very well during the last performance. The energy, the visual is no joking! She did goooooood job!!!
=
CAN U PLZ TELL ME WHO ARE THEY
=
뭐야 저거 정예인임? ㅁㅊ다 역시 내 원픽
=
3:32 who is she im so impressed
=
Thank you Mnet for making this iconic and wonderful stage that we can so go back and watch when years went by
=
예인 처음에 소름돋긴 했는데
유아 댓글 왜케 없으뮤ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 취향차인가 나는 유아 부분만 겁나게 돌려보는중ㅠㅠㅠ
=
So its confirm ! I'm gay for soojin ahhh~~~
=
친절한 예인씨ㅠㅜㅠ
=
Moonbyul!! she so cool and awesome!! good job, you've done your best😍
=

=
yooa really stole the show with this one!
=
Moonbyul💜
=
I’m gay for all of these girls...
=
예인님 무대보러 맨날 첫부분 보러 온다
=
만약 담 시즌 낸다면 킹덤 같은거 하지말고 퀸덤 시즌2나 내줬으면 좋겠다
=
Red is the colour!! Double red win👍
=
와... 친절한금자씨는 영화 스텝업 졸업무대 보는거같네... 이 완벽함 뭐지....개소름
=
헐 영상 뒤부터 보다가 유아인줄 전혀 모름. 여태까지 스타일이랑 완전 달라서그릉가
=
진짜 다멋있는데 예인이 너무 압도적인 무대가아닌가 생각듬.. 분위기랑 잘어울리고 곡선택너무 잘함 영화캐릭터랑도 느낌비슷하고
아그리고 찬미 끼없다 하시는분있는데 ㅋㅋㅋ 단체무대에서 찬미표정보셈 압도적임 ^^
=
Does anyone know the name of the song that Moon Byul of Mamamoo first dance with?
=
If only they do Dangerous instead of Smooth Criminal
=
박봄 분신 이건 뭐죠 ㅋㅋㅋ
제 의견은 유아 젤 잘한듯
=
이건...진짜...미쳤다
=
근데 다 진짜 잘 추긴 하는데 수진 몸 쓰는 게 엄청 돋보적임 춤선이 엄청 남다른느낌,,,,,
=
제일 초반 시작할때 누구임 존나 이쁘네
=
I was wishing for an Oh My Boy comeback for this year. YooA answered my prayers 😍
=
마이클잭슨 빨강 보다 보라색이 더 어울렸을듯 한데 쨌든 잘했음
=
찬미 몸에 균형 딱 잡히고 착지할때나 무빙할때 중심 안흔들리는 거 
팔 움직일때도 근육 하나하나 각 맞는거 대박인데 왜 이거 말 해주는 사람 아무듀 음셩?
=
MOOOOOOOOOONBYULLLLLLLLLLLL
=
If we have SuperM as the  avenger group of kpop.I would think Six Puzzle is avenger group of kpop for girls ver.
=
저대로 그룹 만들어주세요...개좋아...
=
2:31 근데 퀸덤 안보는데 영상보다 진짜 궁금해서 그런데 중간에 왜 할로윈 분장하고있는지 저렇게하고 와우 하는데 표정이랑 리액션 너무 귀여움 계속보는중 난 분명 춤보러왔는데
=
Moonbyul is so pretty..
=
The other groupies: 👏👏

OMG be like: WHOAA 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 THATS MY GIRLLL
=
Solar's expression can not be more interesting :)))))))) can not stop laughing
=
what emission is that !?!?
=
나만 다른팀은 공연하는사람 대기실처럼 딱 보이는데 마마무만 되게 파자마파티느낌인가 그래서 너무 귀여우신데 ㅠㅠ ?? 💖💖
=
These girls are amazinggggggggg as hell
=
This is really hard to choose because some groups had bigger productions
=
5:59
=
5:58
=
YooA omg 💘
=
The song yein preformed  
What's  the title  of that??
=
Ohhhhhhh!!! Soojin you so so HOT!!!!
=
I don't know about you, but THIS is powerful.
=
Soojin☠️
=
call 911 
my straight side died
=
love how diverse and unique all these girls' auras are. intl fans are always talking about how kpop either has cutesy girl groups or girl crush, but these girls just proved them so wrong even I felt the burn. All of them have such different styles and strengths. Their personality cant be contained in just a concept.
=
Moonbyul minha sapatão fav
=
#18 trending in Malaysia ...its just wauu
=
아니근데 중간중간에 리액션이 너무 많이 나옴 너무 컷마다 리액션을 두세그룹씩 넣으니까 무대에 집중이 안됨 리액션컷좀 줄여라
=
누가 잘하고 못하고 없이 다 너무 잘했는데 예인이가 많이 성장했다고 느껴지는 무대였고 찬미의 재발견이라고 생각한다ㅠㅜ 직캠버전 있으면 좋겠다
=
예인 선이 너무 예쁘고 수진은 섹시로 무대 찢었고 찬미 시선처리 완벽 그 자체였고 유아는 보는데 눈물이 나더라
=
정예인은 정말 “퍼포먼스”를 했네
=
와 예인 친절한 금자씨 도입부 쌉소름....... 선곡지리고 너무 잘함....
=
문별 카메라가 좀 아쉬워... 정면에서 봐야 진짜 발 스텝이랑 개미쳣는데...
=
I'm scrolling just to click like whoever mention about our precious yein, didn't knew there were a lot😭💕
=
OK My fav parts is
Yooa
Soojin
Yein
Others did a good job but those three really slay it.also MJ probably possessed yooa
=
예인이 무대는 뭔가 소름돋을 정도로 잘함 ㄷㄷㄷ..근데 유아는 와.... 진짜 대박 그자체임
=
STAN YEIN, STAN LOVELYZ
=
yein killed it

=
YEIN IS KILLING THIS CBEUBCISBX ❤️
=
yein and chanmi once again captured my heart uff and now yooa too! chanmi looked a bit like luna here whoa
=
They where so " poppin' " it almost made shuhua cry lol!!!! 😂😂
=
2:02

i can imagine shuhua drooling already while telling everybody *she is my bae don't fight me*
=
I love Yein!!!! 💓💓💓
=
This performance gave me goosebumps for full 10 mins. This is crazy good! But my favorite is Yein's and YooA's stage which I don't really know before queendom. They are really, absolutely, wonderfully, amazingly good!
=
10:20 his reactions 😂
=
2:49 fellas is it gay? 👀 

damn i love this so much and ahhh they used two little mix songs ksjsk yess girl power!!
=
O:57 comparisson of the 2 dancers on the sides... Yooa wow fire
=
T H E Y   A L L   K I L L E D   T H I S   🔥🔥🔥
=
I still question how uri moonbyul is so handsome and beautiful at the same time
=
와 예인 진짜 소름 개잘해
=
이번무대는 예인이가 진짜 잘한거같음... 내기준 1등..
=
I really never imagined that these precious girls will have a collaboration. Also I forgot that this is competition.
=

=
00:13 아무도 언급 안했는데 예인 표정 왤케 섬뜩해보이지 친절한 금자씨 이영애의 약간 뭐랄까 소름 끼치는 모습이 보이는 것 같다
=

SOOJIN AND YOOA kajsISHSKSHDJS

soojin and moonbyul did it for the gays in two ways
=
Byullie turned me gay
=
개인적으로 단체무대때 박봄 대체자랑 백댄서들은 없었으면 더 좋았을듯 백댄서들때메 멤버들이 잘안보이고 6명이라서 그런지 문별입장부터 동선겹쳐서 서로가리고 5명이서 무대하는게 딱좋았을듯
=

=
For the solo performance, I seriously like and enjoy Yein’s stage. But Soojin got my eyes locked on her during the team performance, she’s really clean and powerful OMG
=
예인 진짜 미쳤나 저런 사람한테 오빵오빵 시켰으니 얼마나 답답했을까
=
이번에 예인 진짜 개미친듯,,, 예인 특유의 눈빛하고 친절한금자씨 ost 너무 잘어울렸음,,ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ 처음에 눈 시뻘겋게 어쩌구에서 소름돋아서 1:26에 뒤짐
